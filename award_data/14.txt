0720749	CSR-SMA:  Toward Model-Driven Multilevel Analysis and Optimization of Multicomponent Computer Systems	CNS	COMPUTER SYSTEMS	08/01/2007	08/09/2011	Padma Raghavan	PA	Pennsylvania State Univ University Park	Continuing grant	M. Mimi McClure	07/31/2012	$700,000.00	Mary Irwin, Mahmut Kandemir, Jia Li, Suzanne Shontz	padma.raghavan@vanderbilt.edu	110 Technology Center Building	UNIVERSITY PARK	PA	168027000	8148651372	CSE	7354	9218, HPCC	$0.00	This project seeks to enable model-driven optimizations spanning<br/>multiple levels of a computing system including the architecture,<br/>compiler, algorithm and application layers,  for multiple objectives<br/>such as performance, power and productivity.  A primary goal is to<br/>develop  a comprehensive framework for model-driven multilevel,<br/>multiobjective optimizations  with a focus on chip multiprocessors<br/>(CMPs) and large-scale,  sparse engineering and scientific applications.<br/>Key activities concern developing (i) parameterized models to<br/>compose models of the application, architecture and compiler<br/>transformations, (ii) an optimization framework  to determine<br/>multiobjective, optimal or pareto-optimal  designs while modeling<br/>uncertainties, and (iii) undergraduate and graduate courses on the<br/>methodology for multilevel optimizations of computing systems, <br/><br/>The proposed techniques yield metrics at  coarse- and medium-scales<br/>that can be used with stochastic optimization techniques to determine<br/>optimal design choices. The medium-scale metrics are obtained by<br/>simulating a concatenated  discrete time Markov Chain model (C-DT-MCM)<br/>which incorporates both the deterministic and stochastic aspects<br/>of multilevel optimizations and their impacts.  Such  C-DT-MCMs can<br/>be simulated very efficiently  to obtain traces which can then be<br/>compared using statistical techniques  with those from detailed<br/>hardware simulation.  Using this approach, only promising design<br/>options need  be studied in detail, using current modalities, such<br/>as detailed hardware  simulators, which can be prohibitively slow<br/>for larger CMP architectures.

0652833	FRG: Collaborative Research: Integrated Mathematical Methods in Medical Imaging	DMS	APPLIED MATHEMATICS	08/15/2007	10/20/2008	Anne Gelb	AZ	Arizona State University	Standard Grant	Henry A. Warchall	07/31/2012	$818,374.00	Randall Eubank, Douglas Cochran, Anne Gelb, Svetlana Roudenko	annegelb@asu.edu	ORSPA	TEMPE	AZ	852816011	4809655479	MPS	1266	0000, 1616, OTHR	$0.00	This grant supports a collaborative team of researchers from Arizona State University and the Keller Center for Imaging Innovation at the Barrow Neurological Institute. The research team consists of five mathematical scientists, representing complementary expertise in pure and applied harmonic analysis, computational mathematics, and statistics, and two experts in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).  The project highlights scientific challenges in the domain of MR data acquisition and reconstruction, including image formation from sparse and/or non-uniformly collected data, restoration of data corrupted by system imperfections, as well as rapid and robust image  construction from data acquired by multiple receivers.  The crosscutting expertise of the research team is enabling development of rigorous tools for addressing these challenges, providing the underpinnings for provable results, quantifiable measures of performance, and efficient algorithms. The team's approach entails in-depth mathematical study of data collection procedures utilized in MRI, including the physical constraints under which they must be undertaken.  This understanding provides the basis for conceptualization, analysis, implementation, and validation of accurate, efficient and effective practical algorithms for processing imaging data. A particular emphasis of the project is unification of the data collection and image generation aspects of MRI, which are often considered independently even by informed researchers.  Methodology is sought to enable joint design of acquisition and post-processing techniques that can optimally serve medical requirements.  In particular, this research aims to facilitate design of data post-processing methods that are fully informed about the characteristics of the raw sensor data, such as its non-uniformly sampled spectral nature and underlying statistical variations.<br/><br/>The activities of the collaborative research team from Arizona State University and the Barrow Neurological Institute (BNI) are expected to have significant impact on strengthening the mathematical foundations of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).  The project focuses several areas of applicable mathematics on a circle of application problems where the introduction of improved mathematical techniques offers potential for substantial performance improvements.  These, in turn, will ultimately have broad social impact by improving the fidelity of medical diagnoses, decreasing the cost of medical tools that are presently very expensive, and alleviating patient discomfort by decreasing imaging time and the need for patients to remain motionless for extended periods for accurate imaging. Broader impact will be realized through the connections of the planned research to other application areas, such as synthetic aperture radar, where algorithmic challenges in acquisition and post-processing are similar to those in MRI. Aligned with the research program is a plan for integration of educational components which includes  support of undergraduate and graduate students, as well as the design of new courses. Junior participants will be provided with the modern mathematical training which is needed for their later pursuit of cross-disciplinary cutting-edge professional careers. <br/>
0723118	MRI: Development of a New Paradigm for Apertureless Near-field Scanning Optical Microscope	DMR	MAJOR RESEARCH INSTRUMENTATION	09/01/2007	12/15/2008	Gang-Yu Liu	CA	University of California-Davis	Standard Grant	Thomas P. Rieker	08/31/2011	$374,672.00	Susan Kauzlarich, Timothy Patten, Ting Guo	gyliu@ucdavis.edu	OR/Sponsored Programs	Davis	CA	956186134	5307547700	MPS	1189	9161, AMPP	$0.00	We propose to construct a state-of-the-art tool for imaging materials with high magnification, e.g. visualizing groups of molecules and being able to identify them.  Conventional optical microscopes, e.g. a magnifying glass, only allow visualization at micrometer scale, i.e. a fraction of a human hair.  This is due to the diffraction limit of visible lights.  Using a sharp tip scanning over material surfaces, atomic force microscope enables imaging materials at nanometer level (a small fraction of a human hair), however, provides no information as to what kind of materials (metals, polymers or ions) are under the tip.  One mission in the materials science community is to combine the strength of the high resolution in atomic force microscope with the ability to identify materials shown by optical microscope.  The new instrument is referred to as a near-filed scanning optical microscope.  The task is not trivial due to two competing factors, the need for sufficient light intensity at the imaging site (e.g. using a large probe) and the requirement to make the probe small/sharp to attain optical resolution.  This proposal will use a new methods derived from our finding that specific kind of sharp probes glow when one focuses a laser beam at the top tips.  The glowing tips provide a point light source for imaging and spectroscopy.  Preliminary results have demonstrated the feasibility of generating near-filed signals, and we plan to complete the construction of this instrument, to optimize the performance and to demonstrate its applications.  Compared with past approaches towards this technique, the proposed method exhibits advantages of high intensity of light, simple to operate, and high resolution.  We plan to demonstrate the application and capability of this new instrument by characterization of four classes of important materials: materials containing organic (polymeric) and inorganic (semiconductive) compositions; small inorganic particles with multiple components; carbon nanofibers; and nanomaterials in living cells.  The development of this new technique should bring students and postdocs to the forefront of scanning probe microscopy technology and its applications in materials science.  The completion of this instrument will enhance the Spectral Imaging Facility (led by the PI) at UCD.  <br/> <br/>We propose a new paradigm for near-field scanning optical microscopy (NSOM).  The idea derives from a finding that microfabricated atomic force microscopy (AFM) probes exhibit photoluminescence (PL) upon excitation by a focused laser beam.  This PL tip provides a point light source for NSOM imaging and spectroscopy.  The excitation beam will be focused onto the surface with polarization component perpendicular to the tip axe, as at such we attain laterally localization and enhancement by the AFM tip.  Preliminary results have demonstrated the feasibility of generating near-filed signals, and we plan to complete the construction of this instrument, to optimize the performance and to demonstrate its applications.  The intrinsic advantages of this approach include: (a) high photon throughput with the ability to tune wavelength; (b) simplicity in detection of near-field optical signals because the PL exhibits different wavelength from the excitation beam; (c) high spatial resolution due to the apertureless AFM platform with sharp probes and effective deflection feedback; and (d) simplicity in operation.  Any AFM users should be able to master the operation of this NSOM with a quick training of ca. one week.  Development plan includes: (a) design and construction of a low mechanical noise and high stability AFM/NSOM scanning assembly to attain high spatial resolution (10 nm in lateral and 2 nm in normal directions); and (b) attaining true NSOM signal and local spectroscopy information, for which we plan to modify AFM probes to improve the PL efficiency, to build the excitation path and configuration for high near-field enhancement, and to build a high sensitivity and selectivity detection of near field signals.  Combining expertise of NSOM instrumentation (Liu), nanofibers and wave guides (Guo), polymer nanocomposite materials (Patten) and nanoparticles with novel applications (Kauzlarich), we plan to use this NSOM for: (a) revealing the protein complex formed at the cell focal adhesion on nanostructures of ligands; (b) investigating the structure and optical property of polymer-nanoparticle composite materials; (c) measuring the structure and wave-guide property of nanowires and nanowire assemblies; and characterizing the structure and optical property of single magnetic core / metal shell particles. <br/><br/>The development of this NSOM should bring students and postdocs to the forefront of scanning probe microscopy technology.  Students will have a chance to learn and master the skills for the instrumentation of state-of-the-art AFM, optics and detections of optical signals, hardware design for low noise and high stability, electronics for microscopy, and software macros for NSOM.  In addition, they will also investigate local interactions between optical excitation and AFM tip, tip-sample interaction, and contrast mechanism for a variety of materials as the initial exploration for NSOM applications in materials research.  The completion of this NSOM will enhance the Spectral Imaging Facility (led by the PI) at UCD's organized research unit known as NEAT.  The proposed research projects will facilitate further applications of using NSOM for material characterization to reveal the topographic as well as the functionality of the local structures.
0721915	SDCI HPC Improvement: Cactus Tools for Application Level Performance and Correctness Analysis (ALPACA)	OAC	SOFTWARE DEVELOPEMENT FOR CI, EPSCoR Co-Funding	08/01/2007	11/15/2010	Erik Schnetter	LA	Louisiana State University & Agricultural and Mechanical College	Standard Grant	Irene M. Qualters	07/31/2011	$586,070.00	Christian Ott, Gabrielle Allen, Thomas Goodale, Mayank Tyagi, Peter Diener	schnetter@cct.lsu.edu	202 Himes Hall	Baton Rouge	LA	708032701	2255782760	CSE	7683, 9150	9216, HPCC	$0.00	Although the speed and performance of high end computers have increased dramatically over the last decade, the ease of programming such parallel computers has not progressed. The time and effort required to develop and debug scientific software has become the bottleneck in many areas of science and engineering. The difficulty of developing high-performance software is recognized as one of the most significant challenges today in the effective use of large scale computers.<br/><br/>The Cactus framework for science applications has been developed over the last several years,tosimulate physical systems in many fields of science, such as black holes and neutron stars in general relativity. As in other software frameworks, applications are built from separately developed and tested components. The project SDCI HPC Improvement: Cactus Tools for Application Level Performance and Correctness Analysis (ALPACA) will provide high-level tools to allow developers and end-users to examine and validate the correctness of an application, and aid them in measuring and improving its performance in production environments. These tools will be components themselves, built into the application and interacting with it. The developed software will also help render applications tolerant against partial system failures, which is becoming a pressing need with tomorrow?s architectures consisting of hundreds of thousands of nodes.<br/> <br/>In contrast to existing debuggers and profilers, the ALPACA tools will work at a much higher level, at the level of the physical equations and their discretisations which are implemented by the application, not at the level of individual lines of code or variables. It is not enough for only the main kernels to be correct and show good scalability; the overall application ? which may contain many smaller modules ? must perform. Our integrative effort will lead to well-tested and highly efficient applications which are developed in a shorter time scale and execute more reliably. By providing interactive debugging abilities at the application level in production environments,<br/>and by allowing interactive experimentation at the algorithmic level on large HPC systems, the ALPACA tools will significantly reduce the time and effort required to take the steps from using isolated application components on single workstations to performing large-scale HPC calculations.<br/><br/>The ALPACA tools will be developed in close conjunction with scientists from several scientific communities, ensuring their direct usefulness and applicability to real-world problems.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The issues addressed by ALPACA are critically important for the success ofHPC systems at all scales, and ALPACA tools will be highly valuable for algorithm development, performance analysis, and software engineering in many fields of science. The LSU group has been<br/>a leader in developing application level HPC tools, including the Cactus framework, in developing algorithms for adaptive scalability in HPC and distributed HPC environments, and in developing applications themselves; it is a world leader in applying HPC as a tool to solve Einstein?s equations.<br/>The ALPACA project simultaneously addresses problems in physics and computational science,and will provide scientists with radically improved tools to help them bringing their problems to the machine.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: ALPACA fundamentally involves several application areas important to NSF, and will impact many others. ALPACA has the potential to make a huge contribution to computational science by providing a software infrastructure that enables developers and users to create scalable applications and to use them in a correct and efficent manner. Through this tools, we expect groups to concentrate more on physics and numerics, and less on computational details in an ever more complex computing environment. At the same time, many other communities are emerging to solve complex problems, and our ideas and techniques, designed to help HPC software development in any disciplines, will have impact across many of these projects. The ALPACA<br/>tools will thus naturally spread out into the communities. This proposal includes a training workshop and the training of a postdoc and a graduate student.
0704210	Collaborative Research III-COR: From a Pile of Documents to a Collection of Information: A Framework for Multi-Dimensional Text Analysis	IIS	INFO INTEGRATION & INFORMATICS, 	08/15/2007	06/23/2008	Jamie Callan	PA	Carnegie-Mellon University	Standard Grant	Maria Zemankova	07/31/2011	$346,765.00		callan@cs.cmu.edu	5000 Forbes Avenue	PITTSBURGH	PA	152133815	4122689527	CSE	7364, H233	7364, 9216, HPCC	$0.00	Many information workers are swamped with unfamiliar collections of text. One challenge is to obtain an accurate overview of a large text collection, such as the public comments collected in ''''''''notice and comment'''''''' rulemaking. No single tool currently provides a sufficiently diversified picture of such a corpus, and no adequate theory exists to help people explore and form a deep and nuanced understanding of such a text collection. This research seeks to develop a computational framework that allows further exploration of this problem from multiple, integrated perspectives. All the assembled perspectives will be brought together into a single overall supra-document structure that is dynamically constructed under user guidance. In this structure, hierarchical topic clusters will be cross-linked by opinion and argumentation links, using two classes of text analysis engines: one for topics and subtopics, and the other for argument structures. The research team will design, develop, build, and systematically test an overall text exploration framework, an application to support federal regulation writersone called the Rule-Writers Workbench. There is a strong collaboration with Federal government officials who will provide data and participate in user testing. The three PIs have successfully collaborated on a related project under previous NSF funding. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: This is a sustainable collaboration between computer science and political/social  science research, rooted in a challenging and important real world application and informed by years of end user research. Dynamic, user-driven subtopic definition and clustering algorithms coupled with<br/>language modeling are an innovative yet reachable set of goals. The framework to be developed will be grounded in the humanities disciplines'' expertise in  rhetoric, discourse structure, and subjectivity.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The Rule-Writers Workbench will allow federal government regulation writers to employ a suite of technical tools that perform independent analyses of public responses to proposed regulations, including near-duplicate detection and clustering, user-based topic selection from dynamically extracted keywords, opinion identification, and subtopic clustering. These capabilities will open new avenues for federal comment analysis.

Drastic reduction<br/>on the sending rates of data streams typically has negative impact on<br/>the operations of such applications. Effective rate adaptation is<br/>needed to make data streams adapt to network congestion through slowly<br/>varying their sending rate. This research project is motivated by<br/>the need of streaming dynamic radar data at the required rates from<br/>radars to a control center in the surveillance application using ganged<br/>ground-based radars. This application is crucial to the operation<br/>of the unmanned aerial vehicles.<br/><br/>In this research project, an adaptive data pulling framework is<br/>studied to support stable data streaming. This framework consists<br/>of a transport-layer congestion control scheme and an<br/>application-layer data pulling control mechanism. The<br/>application-layer data pulling control mechanism allows the<br/>application actively fetch data from sources. The transport-layer<br/>congestion control scheme adopts a new rate control method which<br/>provides weighted fairness to data streams. Weighted fairness<br/>among data streams is the desired feature for controlling the sending<br/>rates of streams carrying layered encodings. Weighted fairness<br/>means that the throughput of a stream is degraded reversely<br/>proportional to its priority when the network becomes congested.<br/>Weighted fairness brings new vision on rate control for data<br/>streaming. Stability and responsiveness to congestion indications<br/>are the two key research questions of the new rate control scheme.

This proposed effort builds on statewide cultural characteristics emphasizing partnerships and cooperation as primary means for overcoming resource scarcity. This cooperative approach to problem-solving aligns perfectly with EPSCoR''s goals for advancing research capacity and economic development statewide. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: An active and engaged Statewide Committee, using data and analyses gathered by a professional technology consultant team, identified Sensors as the overarching theme for NH''s first RII effort, and identified three interdisciplinary fields (Space Science, Environmental Science and Nanotechnology) where NH''s universities, colleges and businesses are poised for national prominence through sensor development, testing and application. They further identified access to state-of-the-art instrumentation, and experimental and testing facilities as major barriers to advancing excellence. This proposal requests major infrastructure investments including: <br/> * Facilities for developing and testing sensors for a new generation of small satellite systems <br/> * Facilities for generating unique turbulence-flow environments for sensor testing and application <br/> * Significant upgrades in nano-scale surface measurement and materials deposition facilities <br/><br/>These investments will be augmented by support for faculty development and graduate student assistantships and fellowships. Synergies among the three interdisciplinary science fields are clearly developed. The space science team looks to new developments in nano-scale sensors to reduce costs and enhance reliability in the space environment. The nanotechnology team includes environmental scientists who will take newly developed sensors and test them under challenging field conditions for long-term monitoring applications. The large-scale experimental turbulence system will provide a proving ground for new sensors for atmospheric and aquatic environments, as well as a unique environment for studying turbulence itself. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: A unique program in Research and Commercialization Partnerships will build on 14 years of experience with the state-funded, NH Industrial Research Center. This Center combines state and industry funds to support faculty and student research on campuses across the state. A modest investment from this EPSCoR award will be leveraged significantly with state and private funds to advance economically relevant research and to develop a core of faculty, student and private-sector participants. Investments in K-12 programming will emphasize direct contact among university researchers, K-12 teachers, faculty at 2- and 4-year colleges, and students at all these levels. Advanced undergrads and graduate students will play a key role in this program as Scientists in Residence and as mentors and role models. Partnerships with non-profits, such as the Mount Washington Observatory, provide engaging environments for inspiring increased interest in STEM education at all levels.

Due to its extraordinary resistance to wear and oxidation, cBN is targeted to be employed as a protective layer in engines, turbines, and other devices exposed to harsh conditions.  The use of cBN protective coatings is expected to improve the lifetime and reliability of automobiles, ships, and aircraft. This project will contribute to the specialized training of graduate students in cutting-edge research fields and to advancing the programmatic efforts of the nation in the area of materials science and manufacturing.  This work is co-supported by the Ceramics Program in the Division of Materials Research and the Materials Processing and Manufacturing Program in the Engineering Directorate.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: Together a laser plasma physicist and a chemical physicist will take an integrative  experimental and theoretical approach to develop a new technique for the fabrication of cBN protective coatings over large areas. They will employ a super-short-pulse laser produced plasma (SSP LPP) deposition technique combined with a novel line-focusing technique to meet this objective. The main advantages of SSP-LPP technique are to avoid thermal film ablation and reduce film stress. These features combined with their novel line-focusing technique are expected to lead to the synthesis of large-area, thick, strongly-adhered cBN films on a variety of substrates of technological importance.  The fundamental science emphasis of this project is on the quantification, control, and mechanistic understanding of the plasma deposition parameters that determine the nanostructure of the cBN films. This project contributes to achieving a comprehensive understanding of the synthesis process for thick cBN films, as well as of their thermomechanical, electrical and optical properties, thus becoming technology-enabling in the area of advanced materials targeted at enhancing the long-term performance and reliability of devices submitted to harsh conditions, such as turbines and motors. Graduate students from underrepresented groups who participate in this project will obtain first-hand experience in nanotechnology issues, tools and trends, and learn the physics and chemistry of advanced ceramics, thus broadening their participation in science and technology.

The project is upgrading basic laboratory facilities, offering faculty professional development opportunities, and establishing a new focus on research methodologies in the biotechnology associate degree program that includes student research internships. Faculty are preparing to teach advanced biotechnology and upper-level science courses by participating in workshops, conferences, and semi-annual meetings relevant to the new curricula. Statewide in-service workshops for secondary school science teachers are improving their technical skills and providing them with up-to-date science content and laboratory experiences that they can incorporate into their courses. This, in turn, is resulting in better preparation of secondary students for the biotechnology program at the community college level. In response to the range of training needs in the region's labor markets, the biotechnology curriculum is being enhanced to include a new focus on research methodology. Biotechnology students are being introduced to the basic concepts and methodology of research in a new first-year course. Further training in research methodologies, including internships in regional biotechnology companies, is being integrated across the curriculum. The project is providing equipment necessary to support the enhanced curriculum, such as spectrophotometers, electronic balances and thermocyclers. The project's broader impacts include its focus on addressing regional workforce needs and on increasing opportunities for underrepresented groups to pursue STEM education and career pathways. A multi-tiered evaluation program includes periodic meetings with a statewide and a national advisory committee. These committees are being informed by evaluation reports prepared by an external consultant based on data collected from a number of instruments designed to assess the outcomes and impacts of specific project activities. Educational materials, evaluation instruments and assessment results are being shared with the general academic community via presentations at local, regional and national conferences, journal publications, and via the national Bio-Link network's website and summer fellows program.

These activities are united by their strong need for the MS/MS fragmentation capabilities, the superior sensitivity, and the ability to resolve and analyze peptide mixes using upstream in-line liquid chromatography. The MS will provide crucial insights into the structure, function, and regulation of five fundamentally important biomolecules, including the Midline-1 phosphoprotein, the lipid-droplet-associated protein-1, and apolipoprotein A-I. The MS will provide molecular insights into cellular differentiation and lipid transport processes. The MS will illuminate limitations to photosynthetic productivity, and it will contribute to the use of pectins in foodstuffs and as bio-industrial precursors. The MS will also be used to identify proteins governing plant-insect and plant-microbe relationships, protein chaperone networks, plant responses to oxidative stress, and plant meiosis. Because the most advanced MS on campus has no fragmentation, Liquid Chromatography, or Electro-Spray Ionization capabilities, the new MS will be valuable for many of the university's current research activities. <br/><br/>In addition to the scientific benefit, the MS will be useful for the investigators' undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral trainees.  All of these students and trainees will analyze data from the MS, and about a third of them will be trained to use this sophisticated instrument directly. The MS will enhance the existing semi-annual workshops on Mass Spectrometry and Proteomics,? and it will be integrated into the university's undergraduate biochemistry laboratory curricula to expose students to modern analytical approaches. The MS will be featured in outreach efforts that will include presentations on-campus and off-campus, as well as other novel outreach efforts. Approximately half of this outreach will be directed toward: minority programs, the minority institute Langston University, two of the State's non-Ph.D. institutes, and students who do not currently consider themselves research-bound. <br/>
0722562	MRI:  Acquisition of a Full-Wave Interferometric Digital Radio System For Space Research and University Education	AGS	MAJOR RESEARCH INSTRUMENTATION, EPSCoR Co-Funding	08/15/2007	07/06/2011	Brett Isham	PR	Inter American University of Puerto Rico San Juan	Standard Grant	Anja Stromme	06/30/2012	$226,025.00		brettisham@gmail.com	Central Office of the System	San Juan	PR	009363255	7877580899	GEO	1189, 9150	0000, 1189, 1521, 4444, 9150, OTHR	$0.00	This project is to fund the acquisition of a state-of-the-art multi-point digital radio system consisting of four antennae and their associated receivers and electronics.  The system would initially be divided into a three-point interferometer to be deployed in the field during observational campaigns, and a fourth point to be located at the Interamerican campus in BayamÛn, Puerto Rico.  The equipment would be applied to study how a high-power radio wave, directed into the ionosphere, creates turbulent electron and ion plasma waves, stimulated radio emissions, and streams of high-energy electrons. These processes occur within high-temperature gases, known as plasmas and consisting of energetic free electrons and positive ions. Most plasmas contain a magnetic field which is also important to the physics. This is the case in the Earth's local space environment, and a principle objective is to use the Earth's magnetic field as a geometric probe through observations of the variation in the artificially pumped plasma turbulence as a function of angle. The three-point interferometric configuration would follow changes in stimulated radio emissions with respect to the geomagnetic field direction. In addition, the 3-D full-wave antennas would completely specify the electric and magnetic fields of the radio signals, something not possible with single or dual-polarization equipment. This is an emerging electromagnetic technology and will certainly lead to new discoveries in the physics of plasmas and radiation.  The radio techniques will be combined with advanced incoherent scatter radar measurements and collaborative coherent radar and optical observations to study a range of turbulent processes including the relative importance of Langmuir versus upper-hybrid turbulent effects, a key question in this field. The observations will be carried out at the EISCAT mainland and Svalbard observatories in Scandinavia, the UK/Chinese SPEAR and Russian Barentsburg research facilities on Svalbard, and later at the HAARP and/or HIPAS observatories in Alaska and possibly at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico. The observations will be leveraged by comparison with results from modeling and simulation codes.  The Interamerican University of Puerto Rico campus in BayamÛn is a private undergraduate institution with 99% Hispanic, mostly low-income students.   Four BayamÛn undergraduates are participating in this research. The  instrumentation would support the research infrastructure at Interamerican in BayamÛn, adding value to a new space research faculty position to be filled in August 2007, and providing laboratory opportunities in the undergraduate teaching and research program and in the development of an MS graduate electrical engineering degree program. The project promotes collaborations internationally, nationally, and within Puerto Rico. In addition to publications and professional conferences, outreach efforts will include annual public seminars by each<br/>project participant, to be held in schools, at community events, and in other public forums.

PROSPECT ST.	BURLINGTON	VT	054050160	8026563660	O/D	7217	0000, 9150, OTHR	$0.00	The science, engineering and outreach within this proposal all focus on Complex Systems Modeling for Environmental Problem Solving, and are of central importance to the State and region and integral to the State S&T Plan for Vermont. There are three main components: a research group in Biocomplexity; a Streams Project for Outreach to enhance science education enhancement, diversity and service to society; and outreach to the private sector through incentives for innovation.<br/>The University of Vermont (UVM) has considerable strength in modeling and computation with increasing momentum in complex systems modeling in ecology and evolution. UVM faculty have designed complex systems models for the analysis of invasive species, ground water, and evolutionary dynamics. Strategic investments by VT EPSCoR will bring these faculty members together and lead to an extremely strong collaborative and interdisciplinary Biocomplexity Group who focus on the environmental problems. The scientists and engineers in this group will develop new computational tools and creative models that are broadly applicable to complex systems even outside ecology, such as weather patterns or new materials. VT EPSCoR will implement a plan of resource investment to build the human and physical infrastructure for this talented group that will lead to important fundamental, collaborative, and innovative research. In addition to hardware, the group will receive the technical assistance necessary to foster world-class research, external consultants, mentoring, programmers, and networking. Graduate students and postdoctoral associates will be recruited to join the group. Together, VT EPSCoR and UVM will provide the necessary resources for building meritorious research in the area of Biocomplexity.<br/><br/>In addition to fundamental research, Biocomplexity Group members will work together to integrate existing and forthcoming datasets from research on the Lake Champlain watershed, and use complex systems to model these data. Not only will this unifying project result in broadly useful computational tools and tests of prototypes that identify gaps in data sets, but it will also create a single resource for analysis of very disparate datasets (e.g. phosphorous or nitrogen runoff, invasive species, algae blooms) and it will cultivate integration on a level never been achieved but critically important for the region. This project will have long-term impacts on land use management and the region's economy, including New York and the province of QuÈbec. Some of the data sets will come from VT EPSCoR's educational and diversity outreach program called the ?Streams Project? which will collect and model data on Lake Champlain watershed streams. Thus both the research group and the outreach program for science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) education will contribute urgently needed information about the watershed that will be of immediate use to natural resource managers as they grapple with regulation and investment in the region. An important new impact of the Streams Project will be the targeted inclusion of the rural poor in addition to students under-represented in STEM careers. This proposal is designed to boost private-sector productivity by creating new incentives for innovative research and encouraging interaction among the private sector, the Biocomplexity Group and the Streams project. VT EPSCoR has made substantial progress in outreach for STEM education and diversity, and in private sector investments to promote Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) activity. VT EPSCoR proposes a new experiment to stimulate innovative research that will forward the goals of the new State S&T Plan. Similarly, the award winning STEM education and diversity outreach program has had an impact on teaching, student interest in STEM majors, and diversity among STEM students. A new assessment plan will measure progress in all these proposed projects against specific metrics.<br/>

The Arkansas ASSET (Advancing and Supporting Science, Engineering and Technology) Initiative builds two statewide infrastructure platforms: the Wireless Nansoensors Center and the Plant-Powered Production Center.  Both multi-institutional Centers conduct interdisciplinary, cutting edge research with relevance to industry.  Both Centers have significant technology transfer potential and use cutting edge technologies that can position them for regional and national prominence.  A broad array of educational and training programs focus on improving learning, attracting top scholars, and forming new connections with industry that enhance the training of Arkansas' next generation of science and technology workers.  Each Center includes researchers from the University of Arkansas-Fayetteville, the University of Arkansas-Little Rock, and Arkansas State University.  <br/><br/>The Wireless Nanosensors Center establishes an infrastructure to design and develop arrays of nanosensors that are integrated with wireless systems and can be fabricated on specialized low-cost nanofabrication technology.  Its foci are development of nanosensors and technologies onto organic electronic systems for power generation; preservation of food, enhancing of flavor, and sensing of spoilage; and large scale wireless networking of nanobiosensors and nanoneural devices.  The Wireless Nanosensors Center is intended to be a user facility that fosters collaborations among academic research and industry partners. The Plant-Powered Production Center employs multi-institutional, cross disciplinary teams that use diverse technologies to explore key research challenges in plant-based production of proteins, metabolic engineering and bioproduction of important phytochemicals, and plant stress responses both to direct and to optimize biosynthetic capabilities. This Center is intended to be a statewide virtual facility with direct implications for the agricultural economy Arkansas, the Delta region of the Southern states and nationally.  <br/><br/>The ASSET Initiative makes significant investments in a broad range of programs to strengthen human capacity across the State and to ensure a pipeline of scientifically and technically literate students and employees for the 21st century.  The Human Resource Development and Community Outreach Plan coordinates a variety of capacity building programs with economic impact.  Several programs cultivate the entrepreneurial mindset and expand the knowledge base required for enabling researchers to pursue commercialization of intellectual property and innovative devices.  Other programs focus on strengthening Arkansas' science and technology pipeline to address State and regional workforce issues by increasing numbers of women and individuals from underrepresented minority populations.  These pipeline programs include activities that integrate research and education for K-12 students and teachers, as well as for undergraduate and graduate students.  Education capacity is also strengthened through new faculty hires, mentoring programs, Room and Board sites at each campus to facilitate inter-campus faculty and graduate students exchanges, an Access Grid seminar series, discipline-specific regional and national meetings, and electronic access to scientific journals.  <br/>

The proposed instrumentation package will build on current research capabilities at CCU by adding a multibeam echosounder and an integrated process-oriented bottom boundary layer (bbl) instrumentation package. The bbl observing system will consist of a Nortek Acoustic Wave and Current Profiler (AWAC), Broad Band Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (BBADCP), Acoustic Backscatter Sensor, Laser In-Situ Scattering and Transmissometer (LISST), and a sector scanning sonar with azimuth drive for reconstructing micro-scale bathymetry.  The proposed instrumentation will complement existing instrumentation (sub-bottom profiler) and help establish an integrated geophysical processes laboratory, which will serve to support multiple research efforts including:  benthic habitat mapping and sediment distribution; sediment dynamics in marine hardbottoms; bottom boundary layer modeling; hurricane impact modeling (inundation and coastal response), coastal and beach erosion modeling, and submarine groundwater discharge assessment.    <br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/>The proposed instrumentation will also support student research efforts, as well as be used in several undergraduate and graduate courses at Coastal Carolina University.  The PIs demonstrate effective use of existing instrumentation and proposed use of the requested instrumentation that reflects a strong commitment to both individual student research and hands-on coursework at undergraduate and graduate levels.  Research collaborations are articulated in the proposal and supporting documentation that demonstrate a broader community use of the proposed instrumentation.

The membrane channels are three-dimensional tubular-like structures whose radii are much smaller than their lengths.  The ion flow is modeled by the Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) system, which consists of at least two nonlinear parabolic equations for the sodium and calcium ion concentrations, coupled with an elliptic equation for the electric potential.  The PNP system is singularly perturbed by the presence of small physical parameters multiplying the highest-order derivatives. This project focuses on the effects of the singular parameters on the global dynamics of the PNP model.  It combines approaches from the theory of singular perturbations, dynamical systems, and partial differential equations.  The PI will (i) identify the one-dimensional limiting system of the original three-dimensional PNP system when the radius of the membrane  channel approaches zero; (ii) justify the limiting system by examining the relationship between the dynamics of the limiting system and the perturbed system; (iii) study the existence and stability of the steady state solutions of the systems; and (iv) explore the dynamics of the perturbed three-dimensional system based on the  dynamical information of the one-dimensional limiting system.<br/><br/>Ion channels exist in the membranes of all cells and control a variety of biological functions. Each channel has some specific physiological function; for instance, the movement of sodium and calcium ions through the channels plays a crucial role in conducting electrical signals down the nervous system and activating muscle contraction. Any defects in this physical chemistry process may cause human muscle disease.  Hence, studying the mechanism of ion flow through membrane channels is of importance for the practice of medicine. The objective of this project is to establish a practical mathematical model which can be justified theoretically as well as experimentally. The new system will be effective to capture the essential physiological information of charged ions and can be used by biologists to study the complicated behavior of ion flows by numerical as well as experimental approaches. The results of this research are expected to provide new treatments for diseases and hence help life. It is interesting to note that the transport process of charged particles in semiconductor devices and plasma physics is governed by the same model as ion flow through membrane channels. This suggests that the results of this project will also have potential applications in semiconductor technology and plasmas. In particular, the results can be used to design transistors and integrated circuits and control the physical behavior of these devices. Another objective of this project is to provide opportunity for training students in the related research areas.<br/>

Wright<br/>IOS-0721800<br/>Predation-induced sensitization in Aplysia californica<br/><br/>Understanding how we learn and remember, a fundamental goal of basic research, has been greatly enriched by the study of behavioral sensitization in the marine snail Aplysia californica.  Sensitization refers to the observation that a noxious stimulus may result in an increased likelihood of performing defensive behaviors.  Four decades of experiments in Aplysia have unveiled a vast landscape of knowledge about sensitization, ranging from behavioral to molecular levels.  Earlier research by the PI and colleagues established an evolutionary history of neural mechanisms of sensitization in related sea hares, but knowledge of the ecological basis of this evolution is completely lacking.  The PI and his undergraduate colleagues will explore the hypothesis that sensitization benefits a survivor of a predatory attack by decreasing its risk of subsequent attack.  Their pilot experiments demonstrated that attacks by two different co-occurring predators cause sensitization with distinct anatomical and temporal differences, suggesting specific anti-predator strategies.  This research will further explore these learning differences, will analyze their neuronal basis using conventional nerve cell recording techniques, and will identify other ecologically relevant behavioral changes, (e.g., locomotion, movement toward light) following sub-lethal predator attack.  This research will thus provide a uniquely integrative ecological picture of sensitization in Aplysia.  <br/>The PI has extensive experience with all proposed methods, including coordination of a group of undergraduates to execute them.  This proposal represents a rare opportunity for 15-20 undergraduates (across 3 years) to do full-time summer research on a question with fully publishable answers.  The students will perform experiments, analyze data, present results at national meetings, and publish in peer-reviewed journals.  Field observations and experiments by additional students in an upper level Marine Biology (Biol440) course will be directly integrated into this research.<br/><br/>

The project will produce machine-learning algorithms for species identification, a database, and a web accessible interface for dynamic content. The network will be deployed in tropical montane cloud forests in Puerto Rico where hourly recordings will be transferred wirelessly to remote analysis centers to be digitized. Species recognition programs will use turbo-coding and Hidden Markov Models. An open platform based on Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP will provide the web dissemination of audio, identifications, and associated climate data collected simultaneously. <br/>The project will work closely with the Caribbean National Forest and the Puerto Rico Department of Natural Resources and Environment to ensure that the system is useful for them and other groups that may adopt it in the future. In addition, public outreach will be initiated by incorporating members of the Ornithological Society of Puerto Rico in the bird vocalization identification component of the project. <br/>

However, it is a complex, poorly understood and economically costly phenomenon caused not by one microorganism but by a community of microorganisms.  The identity of the community of organisms that colonize and decay resistant and non-resistant wood species over time in a soil ecosystem has not been revealed.  The predominant microorganisms responsible for wood decay are fungi called basidiomycetes. These fungi degrade wood by secreting a suite of enzymes that breakdown the principle components of wood: cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin.  To better understand the dynamics of the microbial activities that lead to wood decay, this research seeks to identify the bacteria, actinomycetes and wood decay fungi and their enzymes that are responsible for the initial decay of different wood species in a high decay soil ecosystem over time.  Microbial identification will be determined by cloning and DNA sequences of the 16s and ITS fragments and monitored over time by terminal restriction fragment polymorphisms (T-RFLP). Gene expression profiles will be determined by quantitative PCR. At the conclusion of this study it is anticipated that a better characterization of the microbial community and the  enzymes involved in wood decay will be obtained which will lay the foundation for revealing the true picture of the complex microbial interactions that are responsible for wood decay.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/>An educational outreach component will be conducted in conjunction with the scientific work of this research.  African-American undergraduate and high school students will be recruited to participate in this research and given an opportunity for hands on experience in conducting this two year project. It is anticipated that these students will gain a better appreciation and understanding of how molecular tools can be used to answer biological questions, develop their professional presentation skills, and serve as role models to others potential students.

The equipment supports projects that address issues critical to the nation's security, including:<br/>. Degradation of Anonymous Protocols and Countermeasures,<br/>. Improving Quality of Service (QoS) of TCP-based Anonymous Communication, and<br/>. Anonymity Constrained QoS Routing in the Tor Anonymous Communication Network.<br/>The project, based on previous work that systematically studies traffic analysis attacks in flow-based anonymous communication systems, involves unifying different metrics for measuring anonymity. The QoS research utilizes previous work in investigating Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) performance theoretically and experimentally in flow based anonymous communication systems. Since systems can ignore characteristics of TCP traffic, deployed anonymous systems such as Tor suffer from severe throughput degradation. (Tor's server loading strategies tend to produce bottlenecks.)<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: Enhancing information assurance research and education, the infrastructure contributes to integrate security and privacy research into the curriculum. New courses on privacy, anonymous communications, and traffic analysis are under development. The work also promotes close ties with regional industry, mainly in banking and health care. Other universities in the states, including those serving Native Americans, will benefit.<br/>

Prof. Rosenberg and his students, in collaboration with a local company, has developed a novel class of amorphous silica-polymer composite materials that are being commercially produced and are being used in the mining and remediation industries. Despite their improved performance relative to competitive technologies the structural features of the interface between the amorphous inorganic matrix and the grafted organic polymer are poorly understood.  Prof. Rosenberg and his students will develop and employ novel approaches for manipulating the inorganic-organic interface by controlling the structure of the silica using sol-gel chemistry and the structure of the polymer graft by using structurally diverse anchor molecules.  Novel spectroscopic methods for analyzing the resulting composites as well as computational modeling will be used to assess the impact of these interface manipulations. The results will have broad impact on the design of inorganic-organic hybrid materials. The research program will provide excellent training opportunities to students in the area of composite materials. Prof. Rosenberg will involve students from the Salish Kootenai tribal college in Pablo, Montana in his research program.

The grant also will provide support for the purchase of a optical parametric generator, which will allow tunable pulses in the infrared, visible, and ultraviolet region of the spectrum with similar pulse duration and repetition rate to be produced.  The equipment will primarily support research in two areas, measurement of the dynamics in scintillator detectors and measurements of the response of dielectric thin films to ultrashort high-power light pulses.  Additional research with the laser in collaboration with additional faculty in the areas of biological imaging, field-emission microscopy,  and measurements of engineered nanostructures.  The acquisition will improve the university of New Mexico's competitiveness in all of these areas.<br/><br/>The broader impacts involve education and training to undergraduates and graduate students in optical physics from both the Physics program and the Optical Science and Engineering program as well as from additional academic fields.   <br/>

The main goal of this proposal is to develop new techniques and ideas from analytic function and operator theory to answer questions with respect to self--commutator, compactness, cyclicity, invariant structure, and functional calculus of unbounded Bergman operators. As a by product of our proposal, we will also obtain interesting results regarding the unbounded Toeplitz operators. Another focus of the proposed research lies in the area of approximation in the mean by polynomials and rational functions on unbounded regions which is closely related to the concept of cyclicity. Our goal here is to extend the Caratheodory--Farrell--Markusevic Theorem to Bergman spaces over unbounded regions. <br/> <br/>The growing body of recent work on unbounded subnormal operators has provided a rich theory with great deal of challenging problems in both operator theory and function theory. Questions involving unbounded subnormal operators are deep, and, in many cases, the techniques needed to attack these problems are nontrivial and incorporate many interdisciplinary areas of analysis. One of the major inspirational source in investigating the unbounded Bergman operators comes from the existence of many interesting concrete examples of unbounded subnormal operators. In fact, it has been shown that one of the fundamental operators in physics and quantum mechanics, the creation operator, is an example of an unbounded subnormal operator. Furthermore it is not hard to prove that the creation operator can be modeled as an unbounded multiplication operator on a certain space of square integrable entire functions with respect to the two dimensional Gaussian measure. Consequently, progress in the proposed project has important consequences in our better understanding of the structure of the creation operator. <br/><br/>

The rules and norms of local institutions that facilitate effective use of these resources are subject to unprecedented challenges.  This interdisciplinary research project will study the ability of these local institutions to withstand rapid environmental and social change.  Because these changes are particularly acute in the Arctic, this research will study the effects in two salmon-dependent regions on opposite sides of the Bering Sea -- southwestern Alaska and the Russian Far East.  These regions have sharp distinctions in terms of their social, political, and economic histories, but they share similar Yup'ik ethnic backgrounds.  The research team of two economists and an anthropologist who conduct field research in two related phases.  In the first phase, ethnographic methods will be used to document local institutions within the Kuskokwim region of Alaska and the Chukotka Autonomous Okrug of Russia.  The second phase will use the tools of experimental economics to test how these institutions perform, particularly how they adapt to greater risk and uncertainty.  In carrying out this project, the investigators will provide a better understanding of the resilience of Arctic resource systems to increased uncertainty and shocks.  Global climate change is already having dramatic impacts on communities in the study region as well as the Arctic as a whole.  Describing and documenting the role of local institutions in enhancing resilience can inform policy options that are applicable to other Arctic social-ecological systems undergoing similar rapid and extreme changes. <br/><br/>In addition to providing broader understanding of the ability of communities that depend upon subsistence hunting and gathering to adapt to change, this research project will provide benefits to the communities participating in the research in a number of ways.  This project will provide meaningful opportunities for undergraduate participation, particularly indigenous students from the communities in the study area.  Student research projects will be designed jointly with tribal councils.  By providing training to local students, this project will help improve education and develop the human capital in these regions.  The investigators will collaborate closely with village leaders in all communities to maximize the relevance of the study the challenges these people face.  Village leaders in both countries have stated that their involvement could provide their people a greater voice in affecting regional policies regarding subsistence harvests.  To help facilitate this, after the research is completed, the research team will return to the communities to report their findings.  An award resulting from the FY 2007 NSF-wide competition on Human and Social Dynamics (HSD) supports this project.  All NSF directorates and offices are involved in the coordinated management of the HSD competition and the portfolio of HSD awards.<br/><br/>

The program is<br/>based at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (JLab) and is<br/>focused on two objectives.  The primary goal of this program will be to<br/>complete the construction of a tracking system for the Qweak experiment with<br/>the involvment of two students. The second objective will be to prepare a<br/>physics program as well as design and construct instrumentation for the JLab<br/>12 GeV upgrade. The Qweak experiment is a parity-violating electron scattering<br/>experiment designed to measure the weak charge of the proton.  A measurement<br/>of the proton's weak charge can be used to extract a fundamental quantity<br/>known as the weak mixing angle.  The current description of particle interactions,<br/>commonly referred to as the Standard Model, predicts how the weak mixing<br/>angle changes with the amount of momentum that is transferred during an<br/>interaction.  As a result, a measurement of the proton's weak charge will evaluate<br/>the veracity of the Standard Model as well as be sensitive to competing theoretical<br/>descriptions involving new physics should the Standard Model fall short.<br/><br/><br/>While this NSF-supported program will primarily construct a tracking system critical to<br/>the Qweak experiment, it will also continue to play a major role developing a physics<br/>program and instrumentation for the JLab 12 GeV upgrade.  The principal investigator<br/>is a co-spokesperson for a physics program to measure polarization observables of the<br/>nucleon at an energy upgraded JLab.  The measurements made will constrain the stark<br/>theoretical predictions describing these distributions at kinematic regions where<br/>the probed quark carries most of the nucleons momentum.  The PI is also supervising<br/>the design of a tracking system for the JLab energy upgrade.  The development of particle<br/>tracking systems for Qweak and the JLab 12 GeV upgrade is the means through which this program<br/>educates both graduate and undergraduate students thereby enhancing the intellectual<br/>infrastructure of our technology driven society.<br/>

The range of languages spoken there is thus especially rich.  The Native American Languages collections at the Sam Noble Oklahoma Museum of Natural History (SNOMNH) cover languages, primarily from Oklahoma, that are severely endangered and under-represented in libraries and archives.  With NSF support, Dr. Mary Linn plans to expand the documentation of Native languages and increase the accessibility and usablility of existing and newly created collections.  This will be accomplished both with direct curatorial effort and through training Native language speakers and educators. Two series of three workshops will be given: 1) Best practices in audio/video recording, 2) Digitization and archival practices for audio/video collections, and 3) Documentation: From recordings to classroom use. Further, for tribes who have no or very few speakers,  a separate ?Breath of Life? workshop will train participants in the use of existing linguistic and audio materials for language documentation and learning. These workshops will help tribal language programs and archives in their own documenting and archiving practices as well as familiarize the participants to the SNOMNH Native American Languages collections, services, and programs.  <br/><br/>The collection makes possible the production of teaching curriculum and materials for the whose communities are trying to maintain them. It also provides data for linguistic research in phonetics, phonology, syntax, morphology, pragmatics, discourse analysis, and historical and comparative linguistics. With the training workshops, the SNOMNH will promote documentation in language revitalization efforts. Project staff  will work closely with local Native communities in order to make the holdings as accessible and as usable as possible in an effort to encourage all Native people to take full advantage of existing material. This will enable those less familiar with archives and academic venues to use these resources as part of their language revitalization and maintenance efforts. The training programs will also help partner tribal-based language programs and archives with their academic partners to help contribute to the evolving standards in documentation and archiving audio/visual data.

The project brings together an international team of researcher-theoreticians from the Department of Physics at Moscow State University, Russia (MSU) with their expertise in polymer theory, and a research group at Stevens Institute of Technology (US) with their expertise in synthesis, self-assembly and characterization of thin polymer films at surfaces. The use of stimuli-responsive BCMs, whose cores can be used to carry cargo, in combination with layer-by-layer (LbL) self-assembly is a new approach which is explored in this project. BCM-containing multilayers are able to carry and release large amounts of functional molecules in response to temperature or pH variations. The Russian group develops novel theoretical strategies based on weak and strong segregation approaches, a theory of reversible association-dissociation and a Random Phase Approximation (RPA) method to elucidate the structure of BCM in BCM/polyelectrolyte multilayer (PEM) films. The US group (1) synthesizes novel pH- and temperature-responsive block copolymers which contain zwitterionic groups in the micellar corona, (2) studies self-assembly of BCMs of  these copolymers with a linear polyelectrolyte using LbL approach and (3) characterizes micellar structure and morphology in self-assembled films before and after application of environmental stimuli. In situ phase modulated ellipsometry and neutron reflectivity are applied to access the structure and molecular conformations in micelle-containing films. In situ ATR-FTIR and in situ AFM measurements also allow local ionization changes within the film and the strength of intermolecular binding and chain relaxations to be related to film morphology and response. The research yields guidelines for the construction of BCM/PEM films and, in a broader sense, reveals major polymer structure-property relationships as applied to polymer self-assembly at surfaces. The development of BCM/PEM materials will meet a yet unmet need for environmentally triggerable polymer films which, through changes in their structure, can efficiently regulate the delivery of drugs, cosmetic compounds or fragrances.<br/><br/>A significant feature of this collaboration is strong emphasis on education and exchange of faculty personnel and graduate students between the Russian and US labs. Visits of graduate students to MSU with the purpose of integrating theoretical and experimental knowledge of responsive BCM/PEM films in an international setting, exchange of teaching practices, enhancement of an international student exchange by participation of US students in an annual Student Conference on polymers and polymer films in Russia are planned. The US group will further disseminate the knowledge obtained during international exposure to undergraduate and high-school students.  <br/><br/>This award is co-funded with the Office of International Science and Engineering.<br/>. <br/>

'Terahertz' refers to electromagnetic waves with frequencies that are of the order of 1012 Hertz, faster than any transistors can operate. The researchers from the University of Massachusetts have developed terahertz detectors for space science applications, and now aim at developing detectors for terahertz radiation that are potentially useful for non-astronomy applications. Their novel idea for a terahertz detector takes advantage of the exceptional electronic transport properties of   metallic Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes, with diameter of typically 0.6-1.5 nm, much smaller than previous detectors. The device consists of a short carbon nanotube, connected to a photo-etched terahertz antenna on a silicon substrate. Terahertz radiation is converted either to DC or (when two terahertz frequencies are incident) to a microwave frequency which can be further amplified. The unique property of the proposed SWNT detector is that it is predicted to be able to operate one hundred times faster than previous detectors, and function at higher temperatures. The group has demonstrated prototypes of such detectors for microwaves and terahertz radiation. A very important component of this proposal is ab-initio simulations of the devices, literally atom by atom, performed by Co-PI Polizzi, internationally recognized expert on simulations of nano devices, and his students.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The University of Massachusetts researchers have a long record of   involving students at all levels down to high school in their research. The students also are exposed to the broader nanotechnology program at the university. Unique terahertz and nano-technology infrastructure is being built up. The potential applications for the proposed device are to Terahertz Imaging Systems for security-related detection, as well as medical imaging.  The devices could also be applied in terahertz spectroscopy for detection of chemical species. These applications can potentially provide substantial benefits to society.  <br/>

The proposed center could function as an electromagnetic compatibility solution resource center for future problems important to industry.

The developed statistical methods will provide powerful alternatives to tests of enrichment <br/>or overrepresentation that have become popular tools for interpreting microarray experiments.  The proposed methods gain advantages over existing methods by (1) recognizing, accounting for, and utilizing dependence among genes; (2) maintaining continuous information about the degree of difference between gene set expression distributions; (3) identifying interesting gene sets by comparison of gene sets across treatments rather than comparing gene sets to one another; and (4) capturing information about differential expression contained in the joint expression distributions rather than using only marginal distributions.  <br/>In addition to their use for identifying differentially expressed gene sets in traditional microarray experiments, the proposed methods offer a new and powerful approach for identifying genetic loci that control the expression of gene networks.  The integrated research team of statisticians and biologists will identify the best of the proposed methods by theoretical study of their asymptotic properties, by comparisons of their performance on simulated data sets designed to mimic structures found in real data sets, and by weighing the value of biological insights provided by their application to actual data from a variety of microarray experiments.  The asymptotic framework used in this research considers the statistical properties of the testing procedures as both the dimension of the data vectors (number of genes in a set)and the sample size (number of experimental units) grow large.  Such a framework permits evaluation of methods for use on data of very high dimension and produces results that are intrinsically interesting from the statistical point of view.  <br/><br/>The developed methods will be used to investigate genetic control of food intake and energy regulation in pigs and to discover genetic regions that control the expression of gene networks in a population of mice that serve as a model for human obesity.  The insights provided by these studies may be used to develop treatment strategies for human obesity.  In addition, the proposed methods have much broader application to nearly any microarray-based investigation of differential gene expression.  Applications range from the identification of sets of genes that play a role in distinguishing cancerous tissue from non-cancerous tissue to the identification of sets of genes important for developing high-quality plant material suitable for conversion to biofuel.  The general goal of this work is to provide scientific researchers with powerful tools for identifying the most important genes behind a wide variety of biological phenomena.  <br/>

This instrument, which supports nondestructive internal three-dimensional (3D) imaging of samples as thick as 100 om with 30 nm resolution, would be the first nonsynchrotron-based nano-CT in the US.  Forty-seven faculty on the campus of the University of Illinois at Urbana/Champaign (UIUC) are participating. Within materials science, the nano-CT will aid the development of self-healing materials and stretchable/flexible circuits, and it will enable complete characterization of complex materials in 3D micro and nanoassemblies. In the areas of engineering, the nano-CT will improve optical coherence tomography for imaging breast tumors, aid the development of 3D nanofabrication technologies and the modeling of solid propellants, characterize multi-scale particle/pore distributions in concrete fracturing, enable electrode optimization for fuel cells, support the development of new nano-CT contrast agents, and enable the refinement of new ultra-fast tomography image reconstruction algorithms.<br/><br/>Non-technical Abstract:<br/><br/>This proposal support the purchase a very high-resolution three dimensional x-ray imaging system, a nanotomography instrument (nano-CT).  This instrument, allows nondestructive three-dimensional (3D) imaging of samples as thick as 0.1 mm while resolving features as small as 600 atomic diameters in width. In the areas of materials science, biology, bio-engineering and other fields, considerable progress is being made in fabricating materials and devices that operate at a nano-scale, that is, the size regime just larger than single atoms. For progress in these fields to continue it is vital to be able to study the three dimensional structure of materials at that length scale that is much larger than a single atom but much smaller than a biological cell. Outside of major Department of Energy national facilities, this will be the first instrument for this three dimensional imaging in the United States. The capabilities of the instrument are expected to have major impacts in materials science, complex materials, modeling of solid propellants, studies ofconcrete fracture, electrode optimization for fuel cells, and enable the refinement of new methods of three dimensional image reconstruction that can study the time dependent changes in structures.

Kane Jennings<br/>University/Institution: Vanderbilt University<br/><br/>Title:  Linear and Side-Functionalized Macromolecular Adsorbates for Enhanced Versatility in the Self-Assembly at Surfaces <br/><br/><br/>This project will develop two classes of thiol-terminated macromolecular adsorbates for self-assembly of molecularly thick films with unique properties onto metal surfaces. One class of thiols consists of linear polymethylene with various termini, including alkyl, perfluoroalkyl, and methoxy-terminated oligo(ethylene glycol) groups. Another class consists of a polymethylene tether that contains randomly distributed functional side chains, including carboxylic acid, ester, and nonpolar groups, along with alkyl termini. These novel macromolecular adsorbates will be prepared by polyhomologation, a highly controlled polymerization that yields nearly monodisperse, long-chain alcohols with controlled length and side chain composition that can be converted to thiols to enable chemisorption at different metal surfaces. These unique adsorbates will be investigated for applications in ultra-fast and -sensitive pH-responsive thin films and 3-D monolayer templates for patterning and for entrapment and orientation of a key integral membrane protein. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit. The project will generate two new classes of thiol adsorbates and will demonstrate how precise macromolecular control over architecture and composition can be combined with molecular self-assembly to prepare innovative new materials. The linear class of adsorbates is expected to yield the thickest and most protective class of monolayer films yet prepared and will be used to prepare templates for etching, deposition, and biomolecule entrapment and orientation. The branched class of adsorbates should enable a tailoring of monolayer crystallinity and open new applications for monolayers in areas of responsive films. A study into the assembly of these long-chain adsorbates will yield fundamental insight into the roles of adsorbate-adsorbate interactions, including hydrogen bonding <br/><br/><br/><br/>and electrostatic repulsion, and solvent-adsorbate interactions during molecular film formation. We expect the films prepared from these adsorbates to define new standards of stability, barrier performance, and versatility while presenting technologically important surfaces that can be selected as either low-energy or biologically inert. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts.    The proposed films are primed for key applications in chemical sensors, protective barrier layers against corrosion or etching, and unique templates to promote protein orientation at surfaces.  Films that respond to local pH are useful in signaling the presence of analyte compounds when bound by immobilized enzymes or other receptors.  For commercial relevance in sensing, the film must exhibit a large, rapid, and sharp response.  Due to their hydrophobicity, thinness, and tailored composition, the proposed films with dilute carboxyl side groups should yield the largest, fastest, and sharpest response to pH of any organic film prepared to date.  Such high performance would create opportunities for commercial development of these monolayers in chemical sensors where a pH response serves as the transduction signal.   <br/><br/>The project will integrate research with graduate and undergraduate education as well as outreach to K-12 students. The PI is an award-winning teacher at the School and University levels, and he will develop modules and case studies from this research to impact the ~100 freshmen, ~30 juniors, and ~20 graduate students he teaches each year. Undergraduate students who show interest in self-assembly and thin films will be steered toward further molecular-based coursework, including the PI's own Molecular Aspects of Chemical Engineering course, as well as the two undergraduate research positions funded per year within the project. The PI is developing a course on Nanotechnology that he will teach to high school sophomores and juniors through the Summer Academy for Gifted Education (SAGE) at Vanderbilt in July of 2007 and continuing each summer. Examples from this research will provide hands-on design projects to enhance the molecular intuition of these bright young students. In addition, the PI will continue to host a high school teacher in his group each summer through the on-campus NSF-funded Research Experiences for Teachers program<br/>

To meet these demanding requirements embedded systems are turning to parallelism (for performance) and special-purpose hardware (for efficiency). This trend has created a pair of technology gaps in programming of embedded systems.  First, few tools exist to map embedded applications to parallel systems. Second, using special-purpose hardware (ASICs) for the computationally demanding parts of applications makes it impossible to program these parts of the applications. <br/><br/>This project seeks to close both of these technology gaps.  First, the project is developing a programming system for mapping embedded systems to parallel (multi-core) platforms.  This system takes  ?C? code, annotated with real-time constraints, and automatically partitions operations across multiple processors, placing data and coordinating communication and synchronization. The partitioning will be done to meet real-time constraints, to balance load, and to minimize energy consumed.  Second, the project is developing a programmable multi-core platform that matches the efficiency of hard-wired (ASIC) logic on embedded kernels.  The approach is to optimize data and instruction movement to eliminate much of the overhead and inefficiency of conventional processors.  The design of the processor is then optimized to close the gap with ASICs.<br/><br/>This research is expected to enable a renaissance in embedded system design.  It will enable rapid development of embedded systems for emerging multi-core platforms and will ensure that such systems operate efficiently and meet real-time constraints.  It will also enable the rapid development of efficient embedded systems for applications and algorithms for which hard-wired modules do not exist.  Overall, this research seeks to make possible the development of embedded systems that simply are not feasible with today's programming tools and platforms.<br/><br/>

In these states, nature and society are integrated in complex socio-technical networks: massive and distributed systems of dams, earthworks, drainage, water conveyance, power grids, sanitary engineering and so on. Social, natural, and technological elements are engineered together and are deeply interconnected. The California Delta is a prime example of a large socio-technical network that is crucial to the stability of a modern state. Understanding such networks is central to the purpose of STS, but preliminary research indicates that modeling social, natural, and technological elements independently of one another has resulted in partial understandings, that while perfectly adequate for particular purposes, can actually hinder broad understanding of the Delta as a whole, and thus its prospects for sustainability (the meaning of which is contested). This research seeks a broad understanding of the development of the Delta, and also of how it is now assembled, which is a necessary complement to more focused research. The aim is a historical sociological case study, with three key objectives. First, situate the Delta in the broad historical context of western civilization, with a focus on science and the governance of nature. Second, target critical moments in the history of the Delta that explain major outcomes in each case. Third, survey the current configuration of the network with the aim of contributing insight to the contested discussion of network sustainability today. Each of these objectives will be accomplished through an overarching analysis of the formation of the modern state of California as an ongoing process of engineering nature, society and technology together through the co-productions of science and government.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The research foresees a significant contribution to the literature in STS through the publication of a book and a number of articles. Substantial intellectual merit lies in the theoretical insights developed by bringing together explanatory schemes in socio-technical network analysis, neo-institutional analyses in organizational sociology, and historical/cultural sociology of state formation. Engaging these literatures, the research seeks to develop a theoretical approach to socio-technical networks that avoids replacing technological and natural determinism with social determinism. In this context the research elaborates the distinction between agency and causality so that all elements in the network can cause outcomes, but only human actors and their artifacts are granted agency. In so doing the research seeks to reconcile some of the differences between the actor-network and social construction of technology approaches. The concept of ?material culture? distinguishes material technology from material nature, and will be used to integrate socio-technical network research with an account of the material dimensions of modern state formation. These theoretical contributions will inform, and be informed by, a new empirical analysis of the historical development, current configuration, and future prospects of the California Delta. The core intellectual merit of the project is its contribution to research in STS that integrates theoretical formulation and explanation with fine-grained empirical case study analysis.<br/><br/>Broad Impacts: Broad impacts will be made in the area of education and training. A course will be designed, ?STS 180, Special Topics,? on socio-technical networks, with a focus on the California Delta based on the research. This course will be part of the newly formed STS undergraduate major at the University of California, Davis. The research dataset (hypertext format) will be placed on the web for students to use in their own research. Understanding how the California Delta developed, and its contemporary condition and prospects for sustainability, will have broad impact and benefits for society. The research will have policy relevance for all levels of government. Envisioning a book, this research aims to have a broad impact on public understanding of science and technology in society. As well as the public at large, the research will be of interest to numerous constituencies of California, such as environmentalists, scientists, engineers (the categories are not of course exclusive), business people and farmers, among others. Finally, broad impact lies in the contribution the research makes to discussions about the meaning and possibility of large-scale socio-technical network sustainability in the twenty-first century, and the relationship of such to the viability and stability of the state. <br/>

Specifically through this grant the researchers seek to examine the measurable impact of an established teacher professional development program currently offered through the UC Davis Edward Teller Education Center. The Edward Teller Education Center is an established collaborative of the UC Davis School of Education and the Department of Energy National Laboratory at Livermore, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), and exists as a vehicle for providing teacher professional development  around the area of science and technology innovations. The mission of the Edward Teller Education Center is consistent with the overarching Grand Challenge of bringing cutting-edge STEM Content in K-12 classrooms. Through the leveraged relationships with the scientific community at LLNL and the education expertise in the School of Education, ETEC delivers teacher training and curricula to improve upon the subject matter content skills of teachers, provide modeling of best practices in teaching, and support the integration of current research practices within the context of the classroom. The Center draws upon an instructor cohort that pairs a regional master teacher and relevant LLNL scientists in curriculum development and delivery. This proposed validation study addresses Area B: Developing Resources and Tools under the area of Instruction for K-12 Students and Teachers, and examines the ETEC professional development model defined as the Teacher Research Academy. The UC Davis School of Education designs and implements outcomes-based assessment approaches that are used to quantitatively and qualitatively ascertain measurable and distinguishable differences in the teaching practices of the participants in the ETEC TPD program. The resulting outcomes of this project  provide useful metrics for the further refinement of this TPD program. The proposed assessment  considers (a) reported changes in teaching practice; (b) teacher's professional attitudes towards science; and (c) trends in student outcomes. If validated, the effort could result in a model program to be shared with industrial and federal laboratories nationwide. <br/><br/>

The novel technique of quantum cascade laser (QCL) absorption spectroscopy will be applied to HCHO measurements and the study of photochemical oxidation of hydrocarbons in Blodgett Forest, California, as part of the Biosphere Effects on Aerosols and Photochemistry Experiment (BEARPEX).  If successful, this research could lead to significant advances in understanding of the atmospheric processing of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and their concurrent HCHO production, and could help to validate the hypothesis that the pine forest at Blodgett is emitting a large flux of organic carbon in the form of highly reactive VOCs that are oxidized within meters of the forest canopy.  Investigation of the formaldehyde budget at Blodgett will also provide insight into the formation rates of secondary organic aerosols and ozone in forests.<br/> This research will help to fulfill the goals of BEARPEX, and could lead to new results on atmospheric oxidation and the radiative and climate impacts of secondary organic aerosols and ozone formation.  The work will be primarily conducted by a graduate student, and will promote the integration of research and education.<br/>

A. Munir and S. Kim) at the University of California, Davis and the Institute of Physical Chemistry (Professor M. Martin) at RWTH Aachen University, Germany. The goal of this research is to provide an understanding of the heretofore-unobserved proton and oxygen transport processes in dense, nanocrystalline oxides, as an example of the nanoscale effect in functional oxides. The investigators' ability to prepare oxides with ultra-small grain size (approaching 10 nm) has opened a window of investigation on this and on related nanometric effects. The aim is to prepare and investigate such materials in dense, bulk form with even smaller grain size ( 10 nm). Observation of the occurrence of low-temperature protonic conductivity in unhydrated yttria-stabilized zirconia and doped ceria, typical predominant oxygen ion conductors, opens a new door on the fundamental issue of a unique behavior of nanostructured electroceramics.  Heretofore such a behavior has not been observed since prior attempts to prepare such materials in bulk form had not been successful. The researchers' success was made possible by their unique ability (through a novel pressure assisted field activated sintering method) to prepare highly dense (> 98%), bulk, nanometric oxides with a grain size of < 20 nm. The fundamental questions that arise from their observations include: what is the nature of this protonic conduction? What is the mechanism associated with protonic mobility? Since this phenomenon is only observed in materials with ultra-small grain size, how do grain boundaries play a role in mass and charge transport? In view of observation on thin films, are the role and nature of grain boundaries different when the grains are very small? What, if any, do dopant-generated point defects contribute to the process?  The answers to these and related fundamental questions should provide a significant intellectual contribution to our understanding of the nanoscale effect in these functional oxides and stimulate new research in this important area. <br/><br/>The use of stable oxides with mechanical integrity as protonic conductors at low temperatures (even in water at room temperature) has an immense impact on application considerations for protonic conductors. Protonic conductors have an extensive field of application, including their use as hydrogen separators (when used as mixed conductors), or to produce power (when used in fuel cells). They can also be used in electrolysis for hydrogen production, and for reactions to hydrogenate and dehydrogenate organic compounds. Current solid oxide fuel cells require high temperatures (800 - 1000C), a condition that presents material degradation problems, as well as other technological complications and economic obstacles. The economic considerations alone make broad commercialization prohibitive. An effective way to reduce the cost is to reduce the operating temperature without scarifying fast electrode kinetics and high ionic conductivity of the electrolyte, which our results has demonstrated its feasibility. It is to be emphasized that the observed low-temperature protonic conductivity occurs at room temperature without the need to apply a catalyst. The results show that with optimization, viable power generation using water concentration cells at room temperature is a possible goal. An important aspect of the research is the participation and exchanges of graduate and undergraduate students and postdoctoral fellows. In addition to faculty exchange visits, an exchange program for students and postdoctoral fellows is planned. Each graduate student (both from Germany and the US) will go through the entire process from synthesis and consolidation and structural and electrical characterization (at UC Davis) to SIMS determinations (at RWTH Aachen University). <br/><br/> <br/>

For example, I got an 'A' Shut up! You got an A? As to how it is interpreted, human activity is generally context sensitive.  For instance, is the new fence at a country's boarder useful to sustain good neighbors or is it a provocation? Although no one would deny the importance of context, the question of when it does its work remains open.  Does context pre-prepare cognition for action, or does it play its role after the fact?  If cognitive activity self-organizes to best anticipate idiosyncratic situations, for example, then context would have a primary, preparative function, and could be considered to be part of cognitive activity.  The main problem with this hypothesis is that conventional methods of behavioral science are not designed to study idiosyncratic context effects.  <br/><br/>Drs. Van Orden and Holden will approach the problem of context from the perspective of self -organization in the coordination of brain and body with the environment. This approach has proven to be a useful and reliable characterization of motor coordination, but self-organization is relatively less established as a hypothesis about cognition. As such, these intuitive hypotheses need to be fully fleshed out. With support from the National Science Foundation, Drs. Van Orden and Holden will develop and test methods to study whether context is constitutive of cognitive activity. This will require an expanded range of data that examine self-regulating phenomenon of self-organization, as well as new methods to better explore and reveal cognitive dynamics as self-organizing phenomena.  Previously, the tools developed to study complex, fractal, nonlinear, dynamical systems had been described primarily in the research literatures in which they were employed.  The project will include efforts to make new tools available to behavioral and cognitive scientists.  For instance, Drs. Van Orden and Holden are two of four instructors who teach nonlinear methods in the context of an American Psychological Association Advanced Training Institute. The project includes collaboration between the University of Cincinnati and California State University, a DOE-certified Hispanic-serving institution that emphasizes undergraduate education. The project entails training and mentoring opportunities for groups not historically represented in the sciences.  It is also one of the first projects in support of research at an interdisciplinary center for Cognition, Action & Perception at the University of Cincinnati.<br/>

Balch at the University of California at Davis to investigate the interplay between the outer surfaces of endohedral fullerenes and the metal ions contained inside. X-ray structure determinations will be performed on larger endohedrals such as M3N@C82 and M3N@C84 where theory predicts that structures violating the isolated pentagon rule (IPR) should be favored.  Cocrystallization techniques that overcome many of the disorder problems that plague fullerene crystallography will be used. The external environment about the endohedral can affect the location and characteristics of the metal ions on the inside with regard to orientation and chemical interaction with the cage carbon atoms. These interactions will be systematically investigated by examining the effects of reduction on the structure of the M3N@C80 endohedrals in order to define the changes and uncover whether they are persistent. The effects of external functionalization on the structure and chemical behavior of various endohedrals will be studied; in particular, the effects of oxidants on endohedrals will be examined, since the oxidative stability of endohedrals is important to their eventual utility, reactions with organometallic reagents will be used to probe the reactive sites in endohedral fullerenes and explore differences in chemical behavior between the endohedral fullerenes and empty cage fullerenes. The factors influencing the orientation of the metal ions inside endohedral fullerenes in the crystalline state will be examined in cocrystallization studies where the nature of the non-endohedral and the cocrystallization will be varied. The synthesis and structures of hetero-endohedrals, endohedrals with azafullerene cages with metal ions inside will be examined. The magnetic properties of endohedral fullerenes with paramagnetic lanthanide ions in well-defined crystalline environments will be measured. The electrochemical preparation of redox-active films made by electrochemical deposition of endohedrals (particularly those with paramagnetic lanthanide ions inside) and transition metal complexes will be examined in electrochemical studies. <br/><br/>Endohedral fullerenes are under active investigation for biomedical applications including use as MRI agents and as carriers of radiopharmaceuticals.  This work will contribute the education of a new generation of undergraduate, graduate, and postgraduate students in synthetic and structural chemistry, with a focus on endohedral fullerenes but ultimately encompassing a range of organic and inorganic compounds. <br/>

Using the Texas Echelon-cross-Echelle Spectrograph on the Gemini North 8.-meter telescope, he will observe the material from which planets are currently believed to be forming around young stars. The results will bear on circumstellar disk parameters such as the gas temperatures, gas dispersal time, degree of radial mixing, settling and/or growth of dust grains, and gas chemical composition at planet forming radii.<br/><br/>These observations will follow a two-pronged approach. First Dr. Richter will search for unambiguous spectral signatures of disk emission in the pure rotational spectral lines of molecular hydrogen among 25 known circumstellar disks. The resolution of the spectrograph will allow the study of the disk line profiles from which it will be possible to infer gas temperatures and warm gas masses among the best detections. These disks will be followed up with observations of other important molecules, including water, acetylene, and hydrogen cyanide. The abundances of these molecules, along with chemical models of protoplanetary disks, will provide insight into the physical processes taking part in the planet forming regions of these young stellar systems.<br/><br/>This project will also assure continued access by the astronomical community to this unique instrument, which fills an important gap in wavelength coverage long ward of 25 microns, offers exceptional sensitivity, and has far greater spectral resolution than is possible from space in the mid-infrared. A graduate student will also be trained in instrumentation and observing on large optical telescopes. The graduate student to be supported here will also maintain, operate and improve the spectrograph as part of a Ph.D. dissertation.<br/>

The proposed approach is based on modeling the structure of time-varying natural images, and developing model neural systems capable of efficiently representing this structure. This approach will shed light on the underlying neural mechanisms involved in visual perception and will apply these mechanisms to practical problems in image analysis and computer vision.<br/><br/>The models that are to be developed will allow the invariant structure in images (form, shape) to be described independently of its variations (position, size, rotation).  The models are composed of multiple layers that capture progressively more complex forms of  <br/>scene structure in addition to modeling their transformations.   <br/>Mathematically, these multi-layer models have a bilinear form in which the variables representing shape and form interact multiplicatively with the variables representing position, size or other variations.  The parameters of the model are learned from the statistics of time-varying natural images using the principles of sparse and efficient coding.<br/><br/>The early measurements and models of natural image structure have had a profound impact on a wide variety of disciplines including visual neuroscience (e.g. predictions of receptive field properties of retinal ganglion cells and cortical simple cells in visual cortex) and image processing (e.g. wavelets, multi-scale representations, image denoising).  The approach outlined in this proposal extends this interdisciplinary work by learning higher-order scene structure  <br/>from sequences of time-varying natural images.   Given the  <br/>evolutionary pressures on the visual cortex to process time-varying images efficiently, it is plausible that the computations performed by the cortex can be understood in part from the constraints imposed by efficient processing.  Modeling the higher order structure will also advance the development of practical image processing algorithms by finding good representations for image-processing tasks such as video search and indexing.  Completion of the specific goals described in this proposal will provide (1) mathematical models that can help elucidate the underlying neural mechanisms involved in visual perception and (2) new generative models of time-varying images that better describe their structure.<br/><br/>The explosion of digital images and video has created a national priority of providing better tools for tasks such as object recognition and search, navigation, surveillance, and image analysis.  The models developed as part of this proposal are broadly applicable to these tasks. Results from this research program will be integrated into a new neural computation course at UC Berkeley, presented at national multi-disciplinary conferences, and published in a timely manner in leading peer-reviewed journals.  Participation in proposed research is available to both graduate and undergraduate levels, and the PI will advise Ph.D. students in both neuroscience and engineering as part of this project.<br/><br/>URL:    http://redwood.berkeley.edu/wiki/NSF_Funded_Research<br/><br/><br/>

The high speed research vessel will allow research on regional effects expressed in many lakes of the Sierra Nevada, rather than just Lake Tahoe.  The all weather vehicle will be used by staff, visiting scientists and students to tow such a boat, and to transport equipment and supplies to remote locations. The UC Davis Tahoe Environmental Research Center (TERC) has focused its research on lake ecology, lake restoration and limnology over the last 50 years. At the same time it has trained many of today's leaders in these fields. In October 2006, a new facility was opened providing, for the first time, adequate labs and modern state-of-the-art lab equipment. TERC has embarked on new research initiatives such as remote sensing, climate change impacts, and littoral zone processes, which the new equipment will facilitate. A major part of TERC's mission is education and outreach. A public interpretive center has been established, with a full time education and outreach coordinator, two Americorps volunteers, and 50 volunteer docents. It is designed to cater to K-12 and the general public. The equipment awarded will allow for both the expansion of education and outreach and provide greater resources and flexibility to researchers. TERC's mission is also tied to the restoration of the Tahoe Basin.

It is based on a remarkable self-organized mechanochemical machine that consists of subcellular modules, such as (i) actin based protrusion, (ii) myosin powered contraction, (iii) graded adhesion, and (iv) membrane resistance. While molecular inventories of these modules are becoming available, understanding of the motile cell at the systems biology level is lacking. This understanding has to be achieved first for the simple shaped cells, such as fish epithelial keratocytes. The objective of this research is to use a novel combination of mathematical analysis, computer simulations and model-driven experiments to integrate the subcellular motility modules into a multi-scale computational model of the motile keratocyte cell. These tools will be used to find out whether there is a significant cytoplasmic flow in the cell affecting diffusive transport of molecules, what is the role of molecular motors and membrane in stability of stationary and motile cells, and what is the precise way of integrating subcellular motility modules determining motile cell shape.<br/><br/>There has been enormous interest in cell motility--ubiquitous phenomenon underlying wound healing, embryogenesis and cancer metastasis. Cells move by (i) extending protrusive appendages at the front, (ii) developing contractions inside, and (iii) forming firm adhesion to the surface at the front and weak at the rear. While molecular mechanisms of these three steps are becoming clear, understanding of the motile cell as a system is lacking. This project will provide systems-level understanding of the cell motility dynamics and result in predictive model of the crawling cell. The model will help to design experiments that will elucidate cell motile behavior in important physiological and medical systems. Students trained through involvement in this research project will become part of a new generation of interdisciplinary research force.

Sixteen investigators will use this instrument for research on: solution state characterization of the structure and dynamics of biological macromolecules, structural characterization of organic compounds (both natural products and synthesized organics; many aremass-limited), metabolite studies, and development of new NMR methods. This research will produce new insights into protein structure and dynamics, enzyme function, RNA-peptide interactions, molecular scaffolds and assemblies, effects of pollution, characterization of metabolites, and novel biosynthesis.<br/><br/>The new instrument will play a major role in education and professional training at the university. The investigators are from seven departments on campus, and the instrument will enable a user base of over 200 graduate and undergraduate students and post-doctoral researchers to obtain high field spectra with greater dispersion and sensitivity than is now possible. Existing lower field instruments will be liberated for more routine work, allowing rational partitioning of NMR time on all available instruments for use in research and teaching of graduates and undergraduates. NMR is a featured component in numerous campus courses offered in a variety of departments, with several courses having a lab component with hands-on operation of NMR spectrometers. Faculty utilizing the proposed NMR spectrometer participate in well-established minority outreach programs such as the MURPPS program, NSF Young Scholars and ACS Project SEED. <br/>

Teaching sensor network concepts is challenging because the field draws upon a disparate set of computing disciplines. For sensor network programming education, some tutorials exist, but their target audience is largely graduate students and professional researchers.<br/><br/>The PIs' experience shows that the presentation of these tutorials is difficult for undergraduate students as they do not have the prerequisite knowledge necessary. In the past, no lab exercises were available that are appropriate for activity-based teaching of this new and exciting field to undergraduates.<br/><br/>To fill this void, this CSR-CSI project is developing exemplary laboratory exercises at two institutions: Lewis & Clark College, a small private liberal arts institution, and Portland State University, a Ph.D.-granting research university. With input from students, industrial advisors, and an educational consultant, the PIs are developing exemplary lab exercises, identifying topics that are appropriate, clarifying prerequisite knowledge and preparatory material, and presenting the material in a format that is suitable for undergraduates.<br/><br/>The intellectual merits of this work are in clarifying the prerequisite knowledge to employing and programming sensor networks, and building a foundation for teaching these topics to undergraduates. This project also enriches the scientific and engineering research capability of the US, and provide undergraduates with activity-based learning. The effectiveness of the materials is tested on undergraduates at institutions serving a large population of minorities and women.<br/>

The design of such networks that consider performance and power optimization has become a recent research focus. <br/><br/>As nodes in wireless P2P networks may perform similar tasks using common data sets, collaborative data access, which allows sharing and coordination of cached or replicated data among multiple nodes, can be used to reduce the bandwidth and power consumption. The specific goal of this project is to provide a collaborative data access framework for wireless P2P networks. <br/><br/>The project addresses four intertwined issues: (i) various cooperative caching schemes will be designed, implemented, and evaluated; (ii) suitable cache replacement and cache admission control algorithms are proposed and evaluated to balance the tradeoffs between access latency and data accessibility; (iii) novel data replication and data discovery techniques are investigated to further reduce the access latency and increase the data accessibility; (iv) possible security violations to maintain data consistency will be identified, and solutions to defend against such attacks will be proposed. The project will make significant theoretical advances in understanding and designing wireless P2P networks using the collaborative data access concept, and will develop a comprehensive software support for collaborative data access in wireless P2P networks. <br/><br/>The success of this project is likely to have a broader impact on making wireless P2P networks more affordable and amenable to commercial, civilian, and military applications. The results of the project will be disseminated widely through high-quality publications and discussions. The proposed research will also be integrated with the education curricula at Penn State.<br/>

Traditionally, most of this analysis has been conducted on fixed tissue, which although informative, does not allow for the capture of the dynamic cellular movements that mediate morphogenetic events.  Given these constraints, it has become increasingly recognized in the field that live imaging can provide us with an extremely powerful mechanism for elucidating multiple key biological events.   <br/><br/>A fascinating developing system to which this technology can be applied, is the migrating neural crest.  The neural crest is a heterogeneous population of progenitor cells that migrate throughout the vertebrate embryo and give rise to a plethora of key derivatives, including the vast majority of the neurons and glia of the peripheral nervous system, the cartilage and mesectododerm of the face, and the melanocytes of the skin.  This system has been a major topic of study for over 100 years and these studies have contributed significantly to our understanding of stem cells, the effects of environmental cues on cellular differentiation and the role of prepatterning, intrinsic cues in specifiying cell fate. Because of the critical role the autonomic nervous system plays in maintaining homeostasis of all vertebrates, it is this system which we will investigate in this proposal.  <br/><br/>With the advent of fluorescent probes, migrating cells can be followed in living tissue for hours or days. From these data, scientists have developed new views of how neural crest cells migrate and form their distinctive derivatives.  In addition, in the chick embryo there are numerous mechanisms for conducting gain-and-loss of function molecular perturbations. Thus, the approach is to combine these two powerful technologies in order to elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms that mediate the formation of the sympathetic nervous system from their precursor neural crest cells. <br/><br/>The experiments proposed here provide an excellent educational training opportunity for both the undergraduate and graduate students who will conduct the proposed experiments, and data gained from these studies will be discussed and analyzed in the undergraduate courses the PI teaches on campus.  Furthermore the PI often brings elementary students to the lab so that they can experience the thrill of watching live cells move in a real live embryo on the confocal microscope. There is no more effective means to make science immediate and tangible for the non-scientist than first hand experience in the lab.

By using a mono-molecular layer as the active organic semiconductor layer, the effect of exposure to explosive chemicals is readily sensed and can lead to a much more dramatic change in the current flow than when a thicker organic semiconductor layer is used.  Currently, such transistors are being fabricated using expensive electron beam lithography because only small ordered domain sizes are formed from self assembled monolayers.  This research seeks to understand the materials requirements and design rules for organic semiconductors needed for explosive chemical sensing applications.  The project pursues several methods to efficiently and reliably fabricate large arrays of monolayer transistors, including a new method for forming large ordered monolayers by simple spin-coating, Langmuir Blodgett film approach, and direct writing of electrodes onto vacuum evaporated organic semiconductor monolayers using Dip Pen Nanolithography.  The project then investigates the sensing capability of such films.  The project also designs and synthesizes new organic semiconductors or binding sites that can improve the sensitivity and selectivity of the monolayer transistor sensors for the detection of strongly oxidizing or reducing explosive chemicals.<br/><br/>Broader Impact:  The research has the potential to significantly improve the understanding of organic semiconductor materials for explosive chemical detection.  A new class of materials with high performance and robust properties is being designed, synthesized, and characterized using monolayer transistor sensor as a test bed.  Graduate and undergraduate students involved in the project will be equipped with a combination of technical engineering skills, basic scientific understanding, and communication skills to prepare them to contribute to the forefront of sensor technology.<br/>

The infrastructure, based on open research platforms, consists of a testbed that enables wide and systematic experimental evaluation and comparison of underwater acoustic networks. The work, involving this rapidly deployable testbed that can be shared by the underwater networking community, aims to demonstrate the ability of the facility to facilitate field experiments. The project represents a higher-level collaborative that arose from two collaborative groups. One group developing the facility, the other working mainly on the experiments utilizing the facility. The testbed is expected to be a buoy-based system that can be easily taken to different environments. When operational, these systems will be deployed 5 or 6 times a year. The infrastructure will consist of two types of nodes with different capabilities. The first type of node of the rapidly deployable testbed will offer a fixed physical layer capability using acoustic modems such as the WHOI micromodem or the ISI S-modem to implement a physical layer with limited reconfigurability interfaced to a reconfigurable network processor. This network processor will support algorithm/protocol implementation and testing at higher network layers. The Network functions on the Fixed Physical Layer testbed will be hosted by a Gumstix processor which will then communicate with physical layer modems such as the WHOI Micromodem or USC/ISI S-modem via a serial port. Ten to fifteen fixed physical layer nodes will be built including up to 3 gateway nodes. Each gateway node of the testbed will be equipped with wireless RF communication enabling real-time monitoring and control of network performance. The fixed physical layer nodes will be smaller and more easily deployed than the second type of node which is the all-layer node. The all-layer node is a more capable node that will ultimately support algorithm/protocol implementation and acoustic data collection at all networking layers. In addition to the equipment included in the fixed physical layer nodes (i.e., a gumstix network processor and the ability to support relatively fixed physical layer modems such as the WHOI Micromodem and the ISI S-modem), the all-layer nodes will also include a general purpose data acquisition system (D/A and A/D) with substantial disk storage and in-situ processing capability. The MIT r-modem software will be implemented on this general purpose hardware and, along with MATLAB, will enable user implementation and testing of algorithms and the gathering of acoustics data at the physical layer in addition to the testing at higher network layers that it will share in common with the fixed physical layer nodes. Three to five all-layer nodes will be built. The rapidly deployable testbed, using two types of nodes with varying capabilities, should significantly enhance research at all network layers while setting the stage for future infrastructure improvements.<br/><br/>Many research groups investigating fundamental questions about how to design such networked systems that utilize acoustic communications in complex underwater environments have had their overall effort significantly slowed by the lack of common means to test and compare protocols under realistic environmental conditions. This infrastructure responds to the need for consensus on analytic or simulation models for underwater networks where researchers need the ability to gather experimental data under real world conditions in order to make progress. <br/><br/>The network stack will be modular by design with sockets used to enable cross layer control and communication. The physical, MAC, Network and Application layers will be populated with sample components to enable users test their own algorithms or protocols without having to populate the entire stack. Users will be able to write modules to test their own algorithms or protocols at different layers and selectively replace the sample modules with their own. While the development of the modular architecture and sample modules for the network stack will be done with close coordination between all participating institutions, the lead institution for the layers that will be provided are Physical Layer (MIT for the all-layer system, WHOI for the Fixed-PHY system), MAC Layer (USC/ISI), Network Layer (UConn, a geo-routing protocol), and Application Layer (UMass, a DTN routine service). The open characteristic of the testbeds and their usefulness for conducting research will be demonstrated by the members of the team (primarily UConn and UMass as described above) and a few selected outside participants. In addition, acoustic receptions suitable for physical layer research will be made available to the general research community via the Internet. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: This work enables the essential capability of research groups to examine fundamental research questions and their potential solutions in the real world. The infrastructure will directly benefit many on-going research projects in this field  A large number of potential users in the community may benefit from this testbed infrastructure. In addition to the significant research impact, the infrastructure is expected to make a very strong educational impact as well, supporting classes bringing remote access to field experiments to students for whom traditional experiments would have been too costly. The infrastructure can accelerate research and education in the underwater networking field. <br/>

The goal of this project is to develop new hybrid analytical/computational techniques capable of identifying the errors that limit the performance of such systems, and the probabilities with which they occur.  The first component of the project is the application of the singular value decomposition to the equations governing the combination of optical pulse propagation and signal detection at the end of transmission that converts light into electrical energy, which will determine the perturbations that produce the largest changes at the output.  The second component is the application of the cross-entropy method, an adaptive variance reduction technique which assesses the relative importance, in terms of probability, of each type of perturbation.<br/><br/>Experimental testing and laboratory or field measurements of optical systems can be quite costly and require months of time.  A goal of this project is to produce simulation methods that can provide, in an efficent manner, detailed information about system performance, thus reducing the need for testing.  The methods will be used to model both high-speed optical communication systems and new classes of extremely stable short-pulse lasers.  These lasers provide ultra-precise frequency references for communication, radar, and remote chemical sensing, and are an essential component in optical atomic clocks, next generation timekeeping devices that are predicted to have accuracies several orders of magnitude better than current atomic clocks.  Improved accuracies in global position systems and other technologies are expected to result from these devices.<br/>

Software development organizations use this knowledge to prioritize their redesign and validation and verification efforts.  In this research, we extend this work to examine the corresponding power of software security metrics to effectively identify vulnerability-prone and exploit-prone components early in the software development lifecycle.  The technical objective of this research is to create and validate a predictive model that uses security metrics to identify and rank the risk of vulnerability-prone and exploit-prone components in a software product.  The results of this model can be used to inform risk management and to prioritize re-design and validation and verification efforts in the later phases of the life cycle.  The expected result from guiding software development efforts via the predictive model is the production of more secure software.  The educational objective is to incorporate these research results into resources for educating students to engineer secure software products.   <br/>   <br/>

This project focuses on developing a testbed for process-driven and simulation-based knowledge conglomeration in enterprise software development called Saguaro Software Simulation Testbed (or simply SOFTSIM). Essentially, SOFTSIM is a live knowledgebase that is capable of supporting effective communication in a complex social network in the context of enterprise software development.  In particular, the project situates the development and validation of the conceptual framework and software system in the context of Kuali, which is a community-based open source project currently under development by a consortium of nine major universities ( www.kuali.org).  The SOFTSIM testbed will lead to better tools that enable more effective management of knowledge in software engineering. Further, SOFTSIM will help derive teaching modules in several related areas such as software engineering, systems analysis and design, knowledge management, workflow management, and simulation. Finally, this research will contribute to the development of better and less expensive software systems. <br/><br/>

Consequently, it is critically important that this software be protected from unauthorized modification. For example, a malicious user may modify or tamper with a binary to circumvent protection or license mechanisms or introduce vulnerabilities that can be later exploited. Previous software-based anti-tamper and obfuscation research has attempted to provide solutions, but has failed to provide adequate protection under a realistic threat model, has failed to provide practical solutions, or has failed to provide protection against attacks in which an adversary uses sophisticated static and dynamic analyses.<br/>This project seeks to address the shortcomings of current software-based technology for tamper-resistance and obfuscation. The approach taken is to meld innovative, ultra-efficient software dynamic translation technology with theoretically sound encryption technology and dynamic versions of static anti-tampering and obfuscation techniques. <br/>The fundamental contributions expected from this project include: efficient methods for dynamically generating and inserting opaque predicates into running code, new dynamic techniques for program obfuscation, a new approach to self-checksumming that is stronger than previously proposed techniques, and new metrics for evaluating and measuring the strength of tamper-resistance techniques.<br/>The consequences of this research also include several societal impacts. Malicious adversaries continue to find security flaws in and marshal attacks against critical software infrastructures. This research pursues a complementary, secondary defense by making it harder for malicious entities to analyze software to locate vulnerabilities and then use this information to develop attacks. The applicability of the results is expected to be very broad since the results can be used to make a wide variety of software (both user software as well as server software) tamper-resistant.<br/>

An example of such a vaccine is a weakened buffer-overflow exploit with its jump address scrambled: it causes an exception to a vulnerable program when attempting to hijack the program's control flow, from which a forensic analysis can uncover the underlying vulnerability.<br/>The idea of vaccines offers an innovative avenue to address the grave threat posed by software security flaws, which has been fundamentally hampering the progress of the Internet.  This project develops vaccine techniques to protect vulnerable software in both reactive and proactive fashions. Reactive vaccines can quickly detect zero-day exploits and generate signatures without reliance on source or binary code. The project focuses on applying the technique to protect Internet services. Proactive vaccines are used for automatically discovering software vulnerabilities from the sources such as software patches and creating tentative remedies. This technique enables timely protection of vulnerable software even before the attacker can figure out an exploit. This research also provides a great opportunity to foster the education missions in the area of Security Informatics. <br/>

Greenspan	08/31/2012	$693,180.00	Pierre Baldi	lopes@ics.uci.edu	141 Innovation Drive, Ste 250	Irvine	CA	926173213	9498247295	CSE	7652	9218, HPCC	$0.00	Throughout the history of technology, modular design has proven to be an effective way to deal with system complexity. Modular design is also routinely applied to software-intensive systems. Software, however, is different from hardware. Specifically, the fact that software can programmatically affect other software broadens the options for modularization. The very nature of modules can be redefined in ways that would be impractical in hardware. Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) has recently put forth one of those redefinitions. In AOP, some modules called ''aspects'' directly address the crosscutting nature of some design concerns by modeling those concerns from outside the modules to which the local effects belong.<br/><br/>This research will conduct a large-scale empirical validation of the design hypothesis put forth by AOP, and will leverage it to derive principles for modular design. The AOP hypothesis has three sub-hypotheses: (1) Complex software must cope with the existence of cross-cutting concerns; using traditional procedure- or object- oriented design, those cross-cutting concerns show up as design elements scattered throughout several modules and tangled with other concerns within those modules; (2) Scattering and tangling are ''bad''  for the design process; (3) The alternative composition mechanisms embodied in an aspect-oriented language like AspectJ are ''''better'''' than the traditional ones. The empirical validation of AOP will be enabled by an infrastructure called Sourcerer, developed for collecting, searching, and analyzing software on the very-large scale of Open Source software available on the Internet. More broadly, this research will investigate methodologies for conducting empirical research in Open Source software.

The project will initially develop algorithms for tracking single fluorescent particles in vitro and inside living cells. Techniques from modern systems and control theory, including limited communication control and optimal estimation, will be built upon to enable tracking of multiple particles simultaneously. The capabilities to be introduced by this project will enable the study of communication between cells, processes inside living cells, and the dynamics of individual molecules and of molecular interactions. <br/><br/>The ability to obtain three-dimensional trajectory information at fine temporal resolution is a vital component for developing a deeper understanding of many processes in molecular biology. The project is multi-disciplinary with both theoretical and experimental components. In addition to support for a female graduate student, modules for a pre-university outreach program will be developed and utilized in a university program targeting academically at-risk students in the 7th and 8th grades. Taking advantage of the large number of biotechnology companies in the greater Boston area, a new freshman level course will be developed for exploring emerging areas of science and technology.  <br/>

0701055	Topological dynamics of tilings	DMS	ANALYSIS PROGRAM	08/15/2007	08/10/2007	Lorenzo Sadun	TX	University of Texas at Austin	Standard Grant	Kevin Clancey	07/31/2011	$135,900.00		sadun@math.utexas.edu	3925 W Braker Lane, Ste 3.11072	Austin	TX	787595316	5124716424	MPS	1281	0000, OTHR	$0.00	Dr. Lorenzo Sadun will investigate topological and dynamical properties of  spaces of nonperiodic tilings.  His emphasis will be on the structure of these spaces as inverse limits of finite CW complexes, and on their Cech cohomology.  Although the cohomologies of many tiling spaces have been computed, little is known about the functorial properties of the Cech cohomology (e.g., what happens to the cohomology when the tiling space is changed in a prescribed way), and what the cohomology tells us about the underlying tilings. Along the way, he will study tilings with continuous rotational symmetry and tilings that lack finite local complexity. Neither class of tilings is currently understood, but the techniques that Dr. Sadun and his collaborators are developing should allow him to extend results about  translationally finite tilings to these other categories.<br/> <br/><br/>Nonperiodic tilings, such as the Penrose tiling, have been used to model physical materials such as quasicrystals.  Abstract mathematical properties of a space of tilings are closely related to concrete physical properties of the material being modeled. These properties include the diffraction spectrum, the electrical conductivity, and the ability of the material to resist shears.  Dr. Sadun's goal is to develop this correspondence further, both by calculating topological properties of tiling spaces that have previously defied understanding, and by tracking how the topology of a tiling space reflects changes to the underlying tilings.   <br/>

A promising new approach for addressing some of these problems is provided by library generators. Although all library generators have much in common, there is currently little code reuse in their implementation. This project will develop an infrastructure, called Proteus to generate highly optimized libraries for four important problem domains: dense linear algebra, sorting, data mining, and network packet processing. The platforms of interst for these environments include sequential processors with deep memory hierarchies, multi-core systems that provide small-scale shared-memory parallelism, and custom network processors.<br/><br/>Research advances on several fronts are required to make Proteus a reality: a simple domain language for linear algebra in the proposal and appropriate DSL's for data mining and network packet processing. Once domain-specific optimizations are done, the programs will be translated into a lower-level language called the X language, to be developed under the project,  that will represent in a compact way the search space as well as the strategy for adapting the code to the hardware. Proteus will contain tools for gathering information about the target machine, for guiding the selection process either statically or dynamically, for implementing domain-independent optimizations of the X code, and for generating C code as the final output.<br/><br/>The Proteus infrastructure will enable rapid prototyping of library generators for different domains. The libraries that will beproduced in the four different domains will be useful and interesting in their own right. In addition,  tools will be developed for gathering information about the target machines and the computing environment, can be used by themselves in other projects.<br/>

It is therefore plausible that MBHs played an important role in the formation of structure in the Universe.  This project will study the early coevolution of MBHs and their host galaxies, at the end of the cosmic dark ages.  The research will examine key physical processes, including the hierarchical merging of dark matter halos; heating, cooling, and gas inflow inside the first HII regions; how to establish steady accretion onto the first black holes; global angular-momentum-transporting gravitational instabilities; the onset of fragmentation and star formation; establishing the first multiphase dusty interstellar medium; radiative and mechanical launching of winds and outflows; and the merging of smaller black holes into larger ones.  These processes are complex and involve multiple physical scales, so large-scale numerical simulations will be developed to accompany the analytical methods being used.  In order to pay careful attention to numerical accuracy and systematics, those simulations will use multiple methods, including smoothed-particle hydrodynamics, grid-based hydrodynamics with adaptive mesh refinement, and appropriate radiation transfer and sink-particle stellar dynamics.  The results will address some of the key open questions in cosmology, including how the first galaxies formed, whether the MBH or the host stellar system came first, and when was the tight correlation between MBHs and hosts established in different environments?<br/><br/>Because this research addresses the observable spectral properties of the first objects, it will be a valuable guide for astronomical searches with the next-generation of infrared facilities.  It will also help to reduce theoretical uncertainties in estimates of low-frequency gravitational radiation bursts.  Involved graduate and undergraduate students will learn cutting-edge methodologies with many and varied applications.  Unprecedented animations of the first galaxies and early black hole accretion flows will be used in teaching and to disseminate knowledge about one of the least well-understood epochs in the evolution of structure in the Universe.  This research will assist Dr Bromm as he continues to write articles for the popular science press.

The infrastructure, based on open research platforms, consists of a testbed that enables wide and systematic experimental evaluation and comparison of underwater acoustic networks. The work, involving this rapidly deployable testbed that can be shared by the underwater networking community, aims to demonstrate the ability of the facility to facilitate field experiments. The project represents a higher-level collaborative that arose from two collaborative groups. One group developing the facility, the other working mainly on the experiments utilizing the facility. The testbed is expected to be a buoy-based system that can be easily taken to different environments. When operational, these systems will be deployed 5 or 6 times a year. The infrastructure will consist of two types of nodes with different capabilities. The first type of node of the rapidly deployable testbed will offer a fixed physical layer capability using acoustic modems such as the WHOI micromodem or the ISI S-modem to implement a physical layer with limited reconfigurability interfaced to a reconfigurable network processor. This network processor will support algorithm/protocol implementation and testing at higher network layers. The Network functions on the Fixed Physical Layer testbed will be hosted by a Gumstix processor which will then communicate with physical layer modems such as the WHOI Micromodem or USC/ISI S-modem via a serial port. Ten to fifteen fixed physical layer nodes will be built including up to 3 gateway nodes. Each gateway node of the testbed will be equipped with wireless RF communication enabling real-time monitoring and control of network performance. The fixed physical layer nodes will be smaller and more easily deployed than the second type of node which is the all-layer node. The all-layer node is a more capable node that will ultimately support algorithm/protocol implementation and acoustic data collection at all networking layers. In addition to the equipment included in the fixed physical layer nodes (i.e., a gumstix network processor and the ability to support relatively fixed physical layer modems such as the WHOI Micromodem and the ISI S-modem), the all-layer nodes will also include a general purpose data acquisition system (D/A and A/D) with substantial disk storage and in-situ processing capability. The MIT r-modem software will be implemented on this general purpose hardware and, along with MATLAB, will enable user implementation and testing of algorithms and the gathering of acoustics data at the physical layer in addition to the testing at higher network layers that it will share in common with the fixed physical layer nodes. Three to five all-layer nodes will be built. The rapidly deployable testbed, using two types of nodes with varying capabilities, should significantly enhance research at all network layers while setting the stage for future infrastructure improvements. <br/><br/>Many research groups investigating fundamental questions about how to design such networked systems that utilize acoustic communications in complex underwater environments have had their overall effort significantly slowed by the lack of common means to test and compare protocols under realistic environmental conditions. This infrastructure responds to the need for consensus on analytic or simulation models for underwater networks where researchers need the ability to gather experimental data under real world conditions in order to make progress. <br/><br/>The network stack will be modular by design with sockets used to enable cross layer control and communication. The physical, MAC, Network and Application layers will be populated with sample components to enable users test their own algorithms or protocols without having to populate the entire stack. Users will be able to write modules to test their own algorithms or protocols at different layers and selectively replace the sample modules with their own. While the development of the modular architecture and sample modules for the network stack will be done with close coordination between all participating institutions, the lead institution for the layers that will be provided are Physical Layer (MIT for the all-layer system, WHOI for the Fixed-PHY system), MAC Layer (USC/ISI), Network Layer (UConn, a geo-routing protocol), and Application Layer (UMass, a DTN routine service). The open characteristic of the testbeds and their usefulness for conducting research will be demonstrated by the members of the team (primarily UConn and UMass as described above) and a few selected outside participants. In addition, acoustic receptions suitable for physical layer research will be made available to the general research community via the Internet. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: This work enables the essential capability of research groups to examine fundamental research questions and their potential solutions in the real world. The infrastructure will directly benefit many on-going research projects in this field A large number of potential users in the community may benefit from this testbed infrastructure. In addition to the significant research impact, the infrastructure is expected to make a very strong educational impact as well, supporting classes bringing remote access to field experiments to students for whom traditional experiments would have been too costly. The infrastructure can accelerate research and education in the underwater networking field.

Since each individual gene locus is only a small part of the whole picture, association studies based on correlating variation at one or a few gene loci to disease outcomes may miss significant larger-scale associations. An attractive alternative that may be more revealing is to base association studies on correlations between disease outcomes<br/>and haplotypes across selected genomic regions, A prerequisite for association studies, whether they are based on a few loci or on larger-scale haplotypes, is an accurate method for haplotype frequency estimation in a given population. The differences between the haplotype frequencies in a healthy population and in a population of<br/>affected individuals may be subtle. Thus, getting an accurate estimate for the haplotype frequencies is extremely important for disease association studies. Estimating haplotype frequencies is a non-trivial task because current sequencing methods may produce noisy or incomplete data and typically yield genotypes, whose resolution into pairs of haplotypes is ambiguous. Existing methods for haplotype frequency estimation are mainly heuristic in nature, and they are only suitable for large samples of unrelated individuals from a homogenous population over short genomic regions. Any deviation from these conditions may result in inaccurate estimates. The main goal of this project is to develop efficient and accurate tools for haplotype frequency estimation under different conditions, and to integrate these methods with novel tools for disease association studies. In particular, the following activities are proposed: develop accurate, efficient and robust methods for haplotype frequency estimation over short and long genomic regions; extend these methods to deal with small sample size and deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium due to population substructure, and incorporate pedigree<br/>information into the haplotype frequency estimator; integrate the resulting tools with a systematic tool for disease association studies that looks for candidate loci automatically using multiple calls to the haplotype frequency estimator; and launch a web server that will allow geneticists to upload their data and run the programs developed in the project on the fly through the web server.<br/><br/>The direct effect of the project would be to reduce the sample size needed for association studies, thus making more studies possible under the same budget constraints. This in turn will lead to a better understanding of complex diseases, which may speed up the search for diagnosis and treatment tools. The mathematical models introduced in this project may shed light on haplotype structure and on evolution. Furthermore, the project will address optimization problems and statistical learning<br/>problems that may be of use beyond the scope of genetics. The diverse tasks of this project include algorithm design and implementation, software integration and biological modeling. Thus, there is a wide range of activities that are suitable for students of all levels. This will give students an exciting exposure to multidisciplinary research involving computer science, statistics, genetics and mathematics. The methods developed in this project will be integrated in bioinformatics courses at UCSD, and<br/>the material will be publicly available as PowerPoint presentations on the web.<br/>The software developed in this project will be integrated with the existing publicly available web server HAP.<br/>

The social costs are enormous because bots are used to attack millions of other machines.&#65533;&#65533; Botnets are now responsible for over 80% of spam, and increasing criminal activity including extortion and information theft.&#65533;&#65533; Home computers are more vulnerable than necessary because users are insufficiently motivated to install and maintain best current security software. The weakest link in security often is the user, not the technology.<br/>&#65533;<br/>This project focuses on users of security technology. It relies on the novel, multi-disciplinary approach of incentive-centered design (ICD), which draws on game theory, microeconomics and social psychology. Technology ICD often addresses problems of hidden information, hidden action, and externalities. Botnets exhibit these: intruders know more about the purpose of their intrusion than do the computer&#65533;s owners; users are cajoled to take precautions but their actual effort is not directly observable; and the costs of poor home security are borne more by others (who suffer from bot attacks) than by the owner of the compromised machine (a negative externality). This project will identify the underlying incentives problems, use the ICD design toolkit to build security technology that provides effective incentives for improved user behavior, and test the designs in human-subject experiments and/or field implementations.<br/>&#65533;<br/>Combining technical and social design techniques to create pragmatic security technology that respects user motivations and induces more effective behavior can have a major effect on this pernicious and socially costly <br/><br/>

To meet the needs of large scale, controlled and designed synthesis of nanostructures, it is critical to systematically find experimental conditions under which the desired nanostructures are synthesized reproducibly, at large quantity and with controlled morphology. This project aims at an extensive application of statistical design for achieving the above goal. The problems encountered in the synthesis of nanostructures pose challenges that cannot be solved by existing experimental design techniques. Therefore, the primary objective of this research is to develop and apply novel experimental design techniques in order to find optimum and robust processing conditions for growing pure and high-quality nanostructures under time and cost constraints. Based on the collaboration carried out in the last two years between the two groups, the investigators study a novel technique called minimum energy design that is suitable for guiding experiments in controlled nanostructure synthesis. A unique feature of this technique lies in the fact that it originates from a combination of statistical theory and fundamental laws of physics. It has the potential to become important in both statistical and nanomaterial research. The proposed methods will be developed and validated using the synthesis of nanostructures grown in two different materials: Zinc Oxide (ZnO) and Cadmium Selenide (CdSe). Specifically, the focus is on the synthesis of nanowires. Nanowires have the potential to impact numerous areas ranging from electronics, photonics, optoelectronics to life sciences and health care. In particular, ZnO and CdSe nanowires have tremendous potential of being used in the manufacturing of path breaking nanodevices. Thus the improvement that can be achieved in the synthesis of nanowires by using the proposed technique may create a significant impact in nanotechnology. The progress already made in synthesizing ZnO and CdSe nanowires provides a sound platform to launch the new research project.<br/><br/>With this research project, the issues of yield, quality, purity and robustness of nanomaterial production can all be resolved by applying different variants of the minimum-energy design, which is tailor-made to suit the specific phenomena associated with the growth of nanostructures. This is likely to be an early instance of the integration of statistical design with nanomaterial synthesis, thus opening a new path for nanomaterials manufacturing. Scientifically, this research can facilitate fundamental understanding about the growth mechanisms and kinetics of different nanostructures. Industrially, this research can lead to a commercialized supply of nanostructure with custom desired features. By applying the unique and novel ZnO nanostructures as nanodevice building blocks, this project will also advance micro sensor systems and improve their sensitivity, stability, selectivity, power consumption, and response speed. These advancements can have huge impacts on energy, homeland security and environmental monitoring. From the statistical point of view, the minimum energy algorithm is a novel approach to generate designs that are model independent, can quickly ?carve out? regions with no observable nanostructure morphology, allow for the exploration of complex response surfaces, and can be used for sequential experimentation. Owing to its origination from physical laws, it should be appealing and comprehensible to a broad spectrum of scientific researchers. <br/><br/>

The infrastructure, based on open research platforms, consists of<br/>a testbed that enables wide and systematic experimental evaluation and comparison of<br/>underwater acoustic networks. The work, involving this rapidly deployable testbed that<br/>can be shared by the underwater networking community, aims to demonstrate the ability<br/>of the facility to facilitate field experiments. The project represents a higher-level<br/>collaborative that arose from two collaborative groups. One group developing the<br/>facility, the other working mainly on the experiments utilizing the facility. The testbed is<br/>expected to be a buoy-based system that can be easily taken to different environments.<br/>When operational, these systems will be deployed 5 or 6 times a year. The<br/>infrastructure will consist of two types of nodes with different capabilities. The first type<br/>of node of the rapidly deployable testbed will offer a fixed physical layer capability using<br/>acoustic modems such as the WHOI micromodem or the ISI S-modem to implement a<br/>physical layer with limited reconfigurability interfaced to a reconfigurable network<br/>processor. This network processor will support algorithm/protocol implementation and<br/>testing at higher network layers. The Network functions on the Fixed Physical Layer<br/>testbed will be hosted by a Gumstix processor which will then communicate with<br/>physical layer modems such as the WHOI Micromodem or USC/ISI S-modem via a<br/>serial port. Ten to fifteen fixed physical layer nodes will be built including up to 3<br/>gateway nodes. Each gateway node of the testbed will be equipped with wireless RF<br/>communication enabling real-time monitoring and control of network performance. The<br/>fixed physical layer nodes will be smaller and more easily deployed than the second<br/>type of node which is the all-layer node. The all-layer node is a more capable node that<br/>will ultimately support algorithm/protocol implementation and acoustic data collection at<br/>all networking layers. In addition to the equipment included in the fixed physical layer<br/>nodes (i.e., a gumstix network processor and the ability to support relatively fixed<br/>physical layer modems such as the WHOI Micromodem and the ISI S-modem), the<br/>all-layer nodes will also include a general purpose data acquisition system (D/A and<br/>A/D) with substantial disk storage and in-situ processing capability. The MIT r-modem<br/>software will be implemented on this general purpose hardware and, along with<br/>MATLAB, will enable user implementation and testing of algorithms and the gathering of<br/>acoustics data at the physical layer in addition to the testing at higher network layers<br/>that it will share in common with the fixed physical layer nodes. Three to five all-layer<br/>nodes will be built. The rapidly deployable testbed, using two types of nodes with<br/>varying capabilities, should significantly enhance research at all network layers while<br/>setting the stage for future infrastructure improvements.<br/><br/>Many research groups investigating fundamental questions about how to design such<br/>networked systems that utilize acoustic communications in complex underwater<br/>environments have had their overall effort significantly slowed by the lack of common<br/>means to test and compare protocols under realistic environmental conditions. This<br/>infrastructure responds to the need for consensus on analytic or simulation models for<br/>underwater networks where researchers need the ability to gather experimental data<br/>under real world conditions in order to make progress.<br/><br/>The network stack will be modular by design with sockets used to enable cross layer<br/>control and communication. The physical, MAC, Network and Application layers will be<br/>populated with sample components to enable users test their own algorithms or<br/>protocols without having to populate the entire stack. Users will be able to write modules<br/>to test their own algorithms or protocols at different layers and selectively replace the<br/>sample modules with their own. While the development of the modular architecture and<br/>sample modules for the network stack will be done with close coordination between all<br/>participating institutions, the lead institution for the layers that will be provided are<br/>Physical Layer (MIT for the all-layer system, WHOI for the Fixed-PHY system), MAC<br/>Layer (USC/ISI), Network Layer (UConn, a geo-routing protocol), and Application Layer<br/>(UMass, a DTN routine service). The open characteristic of the testbeds and their<br/>usefulness for conducting research will be demonstrated by the members of the team<br/>(primarily UConn and UMass as described above) and a few selected outside<br/>participants. In addition, acoustic receptions suitable for physical layer research will be<br/>made available to the general research community via the Internet.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: This work enables the essential capability of research groups to<br/>examine fundamental research questions and their potential solutions in the real world.<br/>The infrastructure will directly benefit many on-going research projects in this field A<br/>large number of potential users in the community may benefit from this testbed<br/>infrastructure. In addition to the significant research impact, the infrastructure is<br/>expected to make a very strong educational impact as well, supporting classes bringing<br/>remote access to field experiments to students for whom traditional experiments would<br/>have been too costly.

A recent trend is to blur the boundary between game designers and game players, by allowing game players to modify the game and to give free range to their own expressiveness.  In modern games, players can extend or modify the game terrain, as well as the look and feel of the game characters.  The involvement of game players in the creative part of game design has also been extended to the most important part of the game, namely the behavior of the game as expressed through its non-player characters (NPCs).  Game players can alter the behavior of NPCs by modifying scripts that control them.  Unfortunately, this aspect of today's computer games still suffers from a severe limitation, in that there are either just a few highly sophisticated NPCs, or a large number of very simple NPCs.  The ultimate goal, of having the game scale to a large number of sophisticated NPCs, is not an option today.  In this research, the PI will try to address this limitation by seeking answers to questions such as the following.  What are suitable languages for scripting NPCs that are highly expressive yet permit sufficiently interesting character behavior?  What are suitable processing algorithms for games with a large number of NPCs?  How can designers fine-tune their games to balance performance with game-play?  To gain a better understanding of these issues, the PI will develop a novel language (complete with optimizing compiler) that is expressive, but which can be processed efficiently with multi-query optimization from the database literature.  And he will design tools for game designers to create expressive NPCs, which include techniques to allow the designers to easily adjust the quality of the simulation to improve performance.  Stratagues, an open-source game engine, will serve as the concrete testbed for the initial implementation of the PI's ideas; a second implementation in a new toolkit for fast creation of scalable simulations is also planned.  Finally, the PI will explore how his ideas relating to and lessons learned from games can be applied to simulations of virtual worlds beyond games, such as disaster recovery scenarios or simulation of animals and their environment.  The PI expects to convincingly demonstrate that ideas and technology developed initially for programming virtual worlds (i.e., simulations) relating to computer games, can benefit and have a huge impact on scientists who currently labor to write simulations in low-level programming languages.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:  The outcomes of this research will empower scientists to quickly generate realistic simulations of scenarios involving large numbers of humans and/or animals while achieving performance comparable to that of specialized code requiring orders of magnitude more time to write.  To this end, the PI will distribute the software he creates in this project as open source, and will furthermore develop a toolkit for rapid-prototyping of scientific simulations of rescue and disaster recovery operations.

They are used to establish the order of events that occurred on a computer, or to tie virtual events to those in the real world. The time-lining of events is common practice in the analysis of digital evidence. However, computer clocks may differ from the ``real time'', and they continuously drift ``away'' from that time, depending on the quality of those clocks. The consequences of these phenomena for a forensic investigation are yet unknown.<br/><br/>This research extends an existing model to correlate timestamps, which is based on having available complete information about a clock. Given a timestamp found on a computer, the investigator wants to map it to a reference time. This research expands on the basic model, so that error or uncertainty rates can be established, different scenarios of what might have happened on a computing device may be conjectured and analyzed, the ordering of events can be taken into account, and time information that may have originated from external clocks can be considered.<br/><br/>This project advances our understanding of how timed events relate to each other in distributed computing systems. It enables us to order events from disparate sources of digital evidence and quantify the error rate or uncertainty that arises due to granularity and accuracy constraints.<br/><br/><br/>

The proposed effort will be based on:  (1) new decomposition method for lower-dimensional approximations of general complex-valued eigensolutions of random eigenvalue problems; (2) new multipoint decomposition and monomial preconditioner for probabilistic characteristics of eigensolutions; and (3) new design sensitivity formulation for analytic gradients of probabilistic measures of random eigensolutions.  The proposed research is ambitious and novel, differing in fundamental ways from most prior research in this area.  The methods to be developed will address highly nonlinear input-output transformations, an unlimited number of random variables or fields, and arbitrarily large uncertainty of random input.  Due to innovative formulation of the analytically derived stochastic design sensitivities, subsequent optimization of dynamic systems can be conducted employing any standard gradient-based algorithm.  The decomposition method will aid in solving large-scale, multidisciplinary, stochastic eigenvalue problems in engineering and science.<br/><br/>The proposed research will be of significant benefit to numerous commercial and industrial applications, such as civil, automotive, and aerospace infrastructure.  Potential engineering applications include analysis and design of civil structures; noise-vibration-harshness of ground vehicle systems; fatigue durability of aerospace structures; and reliability of microelectronics and micro-electro-mechanical systems.  Beyond engineering, potential applications include nuclear physics, number theory, computational biology, and computational finance, among others.  Therefore, the research proposed here will positively impact a number of areas of national significance.  The transfer and dissemination of knowledge created by this project will take place through continued collaboration with industries, organization of symposia in ASME conferences,  journal publications, presentations and publications at major conferences and institutions, and student education.  Partnerships with two government and industrial laboratories will enable implementation of the basic methods developed in this project to resolve several large-scale industrial problems.  The educational goals comprise recruitment of a Ph. D. student from underrepresented minority or women groups, implementation of software tools from this project in upgrading courses in The University of Iowa's principal engineering programs, and authoring a research monograph.<br/>

Spengler	08/31/2013	$499,875.00		rego@cs.purdue.edu	Young Hall	West Lafayette	IN	479072114	7654941055	CSE	7456	9218, HPCC	$0.00	The secure transmission of information from a source to a destination is typically handled via encryption algorithms. In many instances, data that may or may not undergo encryption prior to transmission can be manipulated to encode messages. With successful encodings, seemingly innocuous channels, e.g., documents, data streams, audio, video, can operate covertly for secret message transmission in various applications, e.g., collusion in finance, electronic information/auction markets, transaction sequences, advertising applets, simulation. Such transmissions violate the principles of data integrity, security, and privacy,  and can be a threat to the functioning of organizations that utilize the applications. The goal of this project is to study, design and implement algorithms for the generation and detection of hidden messages in dynamic contexts. To this end the research focuses on a unified framework that analytically and experimentally examines various forms of message encodings in synthesized data, exploiting inherent structure and nondeterminism in data to confound detectability. The first part of the work focuses on generation methodology, based on statistically synthesized data. Message encodings that are theoretically hard to detect become candidates for the second part of the work which is detection, based on pattern recognition techniques, statistics and heuristics. Core components of the work are both theoretical and experimental, with a focus on the limits of detectability.  The topics of study include novel synthesizing methods and applications, probabilistic encoding algorithms, blind detection algorithms and benchmark generation.<br/><br/>The project is strongly motivated by fundamental research questions, with broad impacts on application areas such as those mentioned above, all of which are of importance to computer, commerce, and homeland security. An integral part of the work is the development of a benchmark generator which can be used as a testbed for new detection algorithms.  By demonstrating how covert channels can operate in diverse applications and disciplines the project will foment cross-disciplinary research in security. It will involve Ph.D research students, support the development of new material in the secure computing curriculum, in graduate/undergraduate courses and research seminars. Results of the work, in the form of publications, reports, algorithms, software and experimental data, will be made available at: http://www.cs.purdue.edu/research/PaCS/spots.html.
0716444	CT-ISG: Collaborative Proposal : Enabling Detection of Elusive Malware by Going Out of the Box with Semantically Reconstructed View (OBSERV)	CNS	ITR-CYBERTRUST	08/01/2007	08/10/2007	Dongyan Xu	IN	Purdue University	Standard Grant	D. Helen Gill	07/31/2011	$130,000.00		dxu@cs.purdue.edu	Young Hall	West Lafayette	IN	479072114	7654941055	CSE	7456	9218, HPCC	$0.00	There is an alarming trend that elusive malware is armed with techniques that detect, evade, and subvert malware detection facilities of the victim. On the defensive side, a fundamental limitation of traditional host-based anti-malware systems is that they run inside the very hosts they are protecting, making them vulnerable to malware's counter-detection and subversion. To address this limitation, solutions using virtual machine (VM) technologies advocate placing the malware detection facility outside of the protected VM. However, a dilemma exists between these two approaches: The out of the box approach gains tamper resistance at the cost of losing the native, semantic view of the host enjoyed by the in the box approach. To resolve the above dilemma, a new approach called OBSERV (Out of the Box with SEmantically Reconstructed View) is introduced to achieve the advantages of both camps by reconstructing the semantic internal view of a VM from external, low-level observations. OBSERV enables two exciting malware defense opportunities: (1) malware detection by view comparison and (2) real-time detection and stoppage of kernel-level rootkits. The broader impact of this research is two-fold: (1) It will enhance the trustworthiness and effectiveness of widely deployed anti-malware systems. Moreover, OBSERV is expected to be viewed favorably by the anti-virus software industry because of its support for existing off-the-shelf anti-virus software. (2) Results from this research will lead to the development of education materials for undergraduate and graduate courses and for professional training sessions.

Typically, one simulates network hardware and software in software using, for example, the widely used ns-2 simulator. Experimentation proceeds by simulating the use of the network by a given population of users using applications such as ftp or web browsers. Synthetic workload generators are used to inject data into the network according to a model of how the applications or users behave.<br/><br/>In order to perform realistic network simulations, one needs a traffic generator that is capable of generating realistic synthetic traffic in a closed-loop fashion that ?looks like? traffic found on an actual network. Unfortunately, the networking community suffers from a lack of validated tools and models suitable for synthetic traffic generation. As a result, all too often, networking technology is evaluated using ad hoc workloads with an unknown relationship to traffic seen on real links and hence begs the question of how believable the results of the evaluation are.<br/><br/>This project is a collaborative effort to develop a synthetic traffic generation resource for the experimental networking research community. The resource consists of (1) synthetic traffic generators for the ns-2, ns-3, and GTNets software simulators, and Linux and BSD-based testbeds, (2) a repository of datasets to be used by the traffic generators to generate traffic that is statistically equivalent to traffic found on a variety of network links including campus networks, wide-area backbone networks, corporate intranets, wireless networks, etc, and (3) a set of traffic analysis tools to enable researchers to generate empirical models of traffic on network links of interest and to use these models to drive the synthetic traffic generation process.

The flow of information through the network depends on behavioral state: for example, processing of sensory input is enhanced when an animal is awake, and suppressed during sleep. Each neuron forms thousands of connections (synapses) with its neighbors, and when the brain switches between behavioral states there must be coordinated changes in the strength of the connections. How this happens is not fully understood. The proposed study examines the role of acetylcholine (ACh), a natural substance that permeates the brain and seems to promote wakefulness and alertness. ACh is known to affect synapse strength as well as other properties of neurons. The goal is to understand how the effects of ACh at the cellular level translate into enhanced processing of sensory input during wakefulness. In particular, the work will address the question of how ACh-dependent synaptic changes interact with short-term synaptic dynamics (rapid, reversible changes in connection strength that depend on the recent activity of each neuron) to influence sensory processing.<br/><br/>The experimental approach will involve computer simulations based on pharmacological data obtained from living brain tissue.  First, electrical recordings will be made from pairs of connected neurons in brain tissue from rodents. The tissue will then be exposed to ACh in order to test its effect on synaptic strength and dynamics. A computer will be programmed to simulate a network containing different types of interconnected neurons, with synaptic connection strengths and dynamics derived from the experimental results. Simulated sensory input will be fed into the computer, to test how it is transformed (for instance, amplified or degraded) as it is propagated through the network. By changing the parameters (simulated connection strengths and dynamics) of the model, it will be possible to test the hypothesis that ACh acts as a global switch controlling sensory amplification (gain) in the network. This will be the first model of ACh action that incorporates different cell types with realistic short-term dynamics, factors that are critical for sensory information processing in real brains. The principal investigator has worked with high school, undergraduate, and graduate students, both as a project mentor and on an ad-hoc basis. In conjunction with the NYU Department of Teaching and Learning, he has presented his ongoing research to teachers from local schools whose students are predominantly from disadvantaged minority groups, with very limited research opportunities. The proposed research includes components that will serve as stand-alone projects for students and/or teachers from the latter group, or for high school students in the Siemens science competition, NYU undergraduates, and participants in the Summer Undergraduate Research Program, which gives priority to women and under-represented minorities. The principal investigator also participates in the course run by the NYU School of Education, which informs local pre-college teachers about current research.

The infrastructure, based on open research platforms, consists of<br/>a testbed that enables wide and systematic experimental evaluation and comparison of<br/>underwater acoustic networks. The work, involving this rapidly deployable testbed that<br/>can be shared by the underwater networking community, aims to demonstrate the ability<br/>of the facility to facilitate field experiments. The project represents a higher-level<br/>collaborative that arose from two collaborative groups. One group developing the<br/>facility, the other working mainly on the experiments utilizing the facility. The testbed is<br/>expected to be a buoy-based system that can be easily taken to different environments.<br/>When operational, these systems will be deployed 5 or 6 times a year. The<br/>infrastructure will consist of two types of nodes with different capabilities. The first type<br/>of node of the rapidly deployable testbed will offer a fixed physical layer capability using<br/>acoustic modems such as the WHOI micromodem or the ISI S-modem to implement a<br/>physical layer with limited reconfigurability interfaced to a reconfigurable network<br/>processor. This network processor will support algorithm/protocol implementation and<br/>testing at higher network layers. The Network functions on the Fixed Physical Layer<br/>testbed will be hosted by a Gumstix processor which will then communicate with<br/>physical layer modems such as the WHOI Micromodem or USC/ISI S-modem via a<br/>serial port. Ten to fifteen fixed physical layer nodes will be built including up to 3<br/>gateway nodes. Each gateway node of the testbed will be equipped with wireless RF<br/>communication enabling real-time monitoring and control of network performance. The<br/>fixed physical layer nodes will be smaller and more easily deployed than the second<br/>type of node which is the all-layer node. The all-layer node is a more capable node that<br/>will ultimately support algorithm/protocol implementation and acoustic data collection at<br/>all networking layers. In addition to the equipment included in the fixed physical layer<br/>nodes (i.e., a gumstix network processor and the ability to support relatively fixed<br/>physical layer modems such as the WHOI Micromodem and the ISI S-modem), the<br/>all-layer nodes will also include a general purpose data acquisition system (D/A and<br/>A/D) with substantial disk storage and in-situ processing capability. The MIT r-modem<br/>software will be implemented on this general purpose hardware and, along with<br/>MATLAB, will enable user implementation and testing of algorithms and the gathering of<br/>acoustics data at the physical layer in addition to the testing at higher network layers<br/>that it will share in common with the fixed physical layer nodes. Three to five all-layer<br/>nodes will be built. The rapidly deployable testbed, using two types of nodes with<br/>varying capabilities, should significantly enhance research at all network layers while<br/>setting the stage for future infrastructure improvements.<br/><br/>Many research groups investigating fundamental questions about how to design such<br/>networked systems that utilize acoustic communications in complex underwater<br/>environments have had their overall effort significantly slowed by the lack of common<br/>means to test and compare protocols under realistic environmental conditions. This<br/>infrastructure responds to the need for consensus on analytic or simulation models for<br/>underwater networks where researchers need the ability to gather experimental data<br/>under real world conditions in order to make progress.<br/><br/>The network stack will be modular by design with sockets used to enable cross layer<br/>control and communication. The physical, MAC, Network and Application layers will be<br/>populated with sample components to enable users test their own algorithms or<br/>protocols without having to populate the entire stack. Users will be able to write modules<br/>to test their own algorithms or protocols at different layers and selectively replace the<br/>sample modules with their own. While the development of the modular architecture and<br/>sample modules for the network stack will be done with close coordination between all<br/>participating institutions, the lead institution for the layers that will be provided are<br/>Physical Layer (MIT for the all-layer system, WHOI for the Fixed-PHY system), MAC<br/>Layer (USC/ISI), Network Layer (UConn, a geo-routing protocol), and Application Layer<br/>(UMass, a DTN routine service). The open characteristic of the testbeds and their<br/>usefulness for conducting research will be demonstrated by the members of the team<br/>(primarily UConn and UMass as described above) and a few selected outside<br/>participants. In addition, acoustic receptions suitable for physical layer research will be<br/>made available to the general research community via the Internet.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: This work enables the essential capability of research groups to<br/>examine fundamental research questions and their potential solutions in the real world.<br/>The infrastructure will directly benefit many on-going research projects in this field A<br/>large number of potential users in the community may benefit from this testbed<br/>infrastructure. In addition to the significant research impact, the infrastructure is<br/>expected to make a very strong educational impact as well, supporting classes bringing<br/>remote access to field experiments to students for whom traditional experiments would<br/>have been too costly. The infrastructure can accelerate research and education in the<br/>underwater networking field.

Regulating the nature and amount of information that is declassified for complex software system is difficult; even when leaks are identified, suitably repairing the computation is usually not possible. The project develops ideas inspired from language-centric transactional computing to support information flow security by encapsulating critical regions that (a) either cannot be analyzed effectively statically or (b) declassify some set of confidential data. Isolation and atomicity properties of transactional regions ensure the approach is safe even in a multi-threaded environment.<br/>The technical issues associated with controlled declassification are examined from an entirely new perspective--rather than attempting to prevent statically any leaks from occurring, this research explores approaches that dynamically monitor when leaks occur, transparently reverting program state to an earlier safe context when leaks are identified. This security model encapsulates untrusted operations and library functions within monitored regions, allowing only information explicitly marked as declassified to escape the region scope. As regions run in isolation, they ensure that they can not be influenced by non-monitored code, nor can they influence its outcome. The monitoring infrastructure leverages transactional mechanisms to track memory use, and restore program state when declassification violations are detected.<br/>The broader impacts are significant. Information flow and declassification are critical problems to cyber-infrastructure, homeland security, and commercial interests. Techniques that provide scalable, transparent, and effective solutions to this problem are of immediate benefit to current government and business initiatives.<br/><br/>

Given the high importance and delicacy of security policies, ensuring the correctness of these policies is important, and yet difficult. A tiny error in security policies could lead to irreparable, if not tragic, consequences. Therefore, identifying discrepancies between policy specifications and their intended function is a crucial task. To achieve this goal, this project pursues a new approach to testing and verification of security policies, including application-level security policies (such as XACML policies) and network-level security policies (such as firewall policies). To accomplish this, this project is defining two unified representations for security policies: program code representation and decision tree representation. Second, the project is developing a suite of rigorous and systematic security policy testing techniques. Third, this project is pursuing efficient and scalable verification and change-impact analysis techniques for security policies. Fourth, this project explores methods for testing and verifying stateful security policies. The project is developing frameworks and techniques for testing and verifying both application-level and network-level security policies. The project will also produce concepts and theories that fundamentally advance the knowledge and understanding of security policies. The concepts, theories, algorithms, and tools produced by this NSF-supported research are expected to promote rigorous security policy testing and verification practice, which will lead to better policy quality and higher security assurance in general. Furthermore, the results of this research will enable further innovations in related fields that depend on the correctness of security policy.

A characteristic feature of most of the reaction-diffusion systems that have been studied to date is that diffusion is normal, i.e., the dependence of the mean square displacement of a randomly walking particle on time is linear.<br/>In some cases, however, a more general dependence is observed, in which the mean square displacement behaves as a power function of time, and the diffusion of the reactants is anomalous.  If the exponent is less than one the diffusion process is slower than normal diffusion and is called subdiffusion. In contrast, if the exponent is greater than one it is faster than normal and is called superdiffusion. Both types of anomalous diffusion have been recognized to play important roles in various physical, chemical, biological, geological, and other processes. For anomalous diffusion the reaction-diffusion system of partial differential equations is replaced by a system of fractional partial differential equations which have been derived from appropriate continuous time random walk models at the molecular level.  The fractional equations are equivalent to systems of integro-differential equations which are the objects of our investigation. The proposed studies will involve both general reaction-diffusion systems with anomalous diffusion, and specific applications. Investigations of general reaction-diffusion systems will help elucidate the universal mechanisms of pattern formation and nonlinear dynamics under anomalous diffusion conditions. The specific models will include the famous chemical dynamics models such as the Brusselator, Oregonator, Gray-Scott, Gierer-Meinhardt, Fitzhugh-Nagumo, and other models, as well as models for combustion, polymerization, and controlled drug delivery.  The effects of both sub- and superdiffusion will be considered.<br/><br/>Reaction-diffusion systems are ubiquitous in many branches of science and have been attracting the attention of scientists, engineers and mathematicians for decades. Since the ground-breaking discoveries of Turing who showed that diffusion in a mixture of chemically reacting species could cause instability of a spatially uniform state leading to the formation of spatio-temporal patterns, and Belousov and Zhabotinskii who discovered oscillating chemical reactions, reaction-diffusion systems have become one of the paradigms for the formation of spatio-temporal patterns in systems far from thermodynamic equilibrium. The formation of such fascinating structures as spiral waves, spatially-regular, stationary patterns with different symmetries (hexagonal, stripe,<br/>etc.) as well as chemical turbulence have made reaction-diffusion systems the subject of numerous ongoing investigations. In many systems, however, the transport process is not via normal diffusion but rather via anomalous diffusion which can be slower (subdiffusion) or faster (superdiffusion) than normal diffusion.  Subdiffusion often occurs in biogels, porous media and polymers, while superdiffusion is typical of some processes in plasmas, semiconductors, surface reactions and many others. Although many aspects of anomalous diffusion have been studied, nonlinear dynamic and pattern formation aspects were the subject of only a very limited number of works. These preliminary studies demonstrate the significance of anomalous diffusion and the necessity for its systematic investigation. The PIs will conduct systematic studies of the effect of anomalous diffusion on the formation of Turing patterns and spatially nonuniform oscillating patterns as well as spiral waves in reaction-diffusion systems, with specific applications to combustion waves, isothermal frontal polymerization waves, and controlled drug delivery.<br/>

Preliminary results show that explosive materials display distinguishable spectroscopic characteristics when compared with a number of substances that could be found in or on the luggage of a typical traveler.  Since the wavelength range lies close to the visible, there is no significant signal loss for detecting target at standoff distances, which is a problem, for example, with terahertz (THz) detection.  Using experiments, the research systematically investigates and characterizes the differential reflection spectra of a large number of explosives and safe chemicals.  Of interest are reproducibility of the results, how the reflectograms of various explosives differ, the possible influence of taggants or impurities, the detection of liquid explosives, whether a given explosive on different substrates yields identical reflectograms, the sensitivity of the technique, how the surface structure influences results, and if exposure to sunlight changes the differential reflectograms of explosives.  The research also seeks to understand the optical DR spectra by performing molecular model calculations.  From the calculated molecular orbitals, possible electron transitions are extracted and displayed as ultra-violet absorption spectra.  The results are compared with the data obtained by experimental differential reflectograms.<br/><br/>Broader Impact:  The technical aspects of this research have the potential to significantly improve safety and security.  In addition, the activities will educate graduate students in basic science and research methods.  Also undergraduate students from engineering and students from the business and law schools will participate in a project on Explosives Detection Devices as a project in the Integrated Product and Process Design (IPPD) program at the University of Florida.  The IPPD project is intended to teach students how to design products and processes in small multi-disciplinary teams under the guidance of faculty and industrial liaison engineers.<br/>

To achieve this goal, this project pursues a new approach to testing and verification of security policies, including application-level security policies (such as XACML policies) and network-level security policies (such as firewall policies). To accomplish this, this project is defining two unified representations for security policies: program code representation and decision tree representation. Second, the project is developing a suite of rigorous and systematic security policy testing techniques. Third, this project is pursuing efficient and scalable verification and change-impact analysis techniques for security policies. Fourth, this project explores methods for testing and verifying stateful security policies. The project is developing frameworks and techniques for testing and verifying both application-level and network-level security policies. The project will also produce concepts and theories that fundamentally advance the knowledge and understanding of security policies. The concepts, theories, algorithms, and tools produced by this NSF-supported research are expected to promote rigorous security policy testing and verification practice, which will lead to better policy quality and higher security assurance in general. Furthermore, the results of this research will enable further innovations in related fields that depend on the correctness of security policy.

The long-term goal is to leverage research in photonic sensors, microfluidics, microfabrication, bio/chemical sensing, and GC to develop next-generation portable explosive detectors for applications in battlefield and homeland security. Toward this end, there are four specific objectives: <br/>1. Systematic fabrication, theoretical analysis, and experimental characterization of the CBORR sensor; <br/>2. Construction and characterization of the laboratory GC system based on CBORR; <br/>3. Validation of rapid and sensitive detection of explosives from matrix samples; <br/>4. Education of students at the high school, undergraduate, and graduate levels through various training venues. <br/>Intellectual Merit: The proposed GC utilizes thin-walled micro-sized glass capillaries whose interior surface is coated with the stationary phase for gas separation. The circular cross section of the capillary forms a series of optical ring resonators capable of detecting analytes flowing in the capillary. This novel sensing architecture combines (1) separation and analysis power of GC; (2) high sensitivity and on-column array detection of optical ring resonators; and (3) excellent fluid handling capability inherent to capillaries, thus enabling sensitive (< 1 picogram) and accurate identification of explosives from highly interfering background with extremely high speed (< 3 second) and minimal false positives. The device developed through the proposed research will provide dramatic improvements in the speed, chemical discrimination, and range of analytes of field-deployable explosive detectors. It will also have a wide range of applications in environmental monitoring, analytical chemistry, and health care. <br/>The team involves both academia (University of Missouri  Columbia) and industry (ICx Nomadics). <br/>Broader Impact: Through the internship program at Nomadics, students will have an excellent opportunity to conduct research in an industrial setting.  Several undergraduate courses are under development to introduce research frontiers in bio/chemical sensing to students. The investigators will make use of existing campus program to involve underrepresented student groups in the research. Outreach to K-12 schools will be expanded to involve more high school students in lab research. <br/><br/>

The infrastructure, based on open research platforms, consists of a testbed that enables wide and systematic experimental evaluation and comparison of underwater acoustic networks. The work, involving this rapidly deployable testbed that can be shared by the underwater networking community, aims to demonstrate the ability of the facility to facilitate field experiments. The project represents a higher-level collaborative that arose from two collaborative groups. One group developing the facility, the other working mainly on the experiments utilizing the facility. The testbed is expected to be a buoy-based system that can be easily taken to different environments. When operational, these systems will be deployed 5 or 6 times a year. The infrastructure will consist of two types of nodes with different capabilities. The first type of node of the rapidly deployable testbed will offer a fixed physical layer capability using acoustic modems such as the WHOI micromodem or the ISI S-modem to implement a physical layer with limited reconfigurability interfaced to a reconfigurable network processor. This network processor will support algorithm/protocol implementation and testing at higher network layers. The Network functions on the Fixed Physical Layer testbed will be hosted by a Gumstix processor which will then communicate with physical layer modems such as the WHOI Micromodem or USC/ISI S-modem via a serial port. Ten to fifteen fixed physical layer nodes will be built including up to 3 gateway nodes. Each gateway node of the testbed will be equipped with wireless RF communication enabling real-time monitoring and control of network performance. The fixed physical layer nodes will be smaller and more easily deployed than the second type of node which is the all-layer node. The all-layer node is a more capable node that will ultimately support algorithm/protocol implementation and acoustic data collection at all networking layers. In addition to the equipment included in the fixed physical layer nodes (i.e., a gumstix network processor and the ability to support relatively fixed physical layer modems such as the WHOI Micromodem and the ISI S-modem), the all-layer nodes will also include a general purpose data acquisition system (D/A and A/D) with substantial disk storage and in-situ processing capability. The MIT r-modem software will be implemented on this general purpose hardware and, along with MATLAB, will enable user implementation and testing of algorithms and the gathering of acoustics data at the physical layer in addition to the testing at higher network layers that it will share in common with the fixed physical layer nodes. Three to five all-layer nodes will be built. The rapidly deployable testbed, using two types of nodes with varying capabilities, should significantly enhance research at all network layers while setting the stage for future infrastructure improvements.<br/><br/>Many research groups investigating fundamental questions about how to design such networked systems that utilize acoustic communications in complex underwater environments have had their overall effort significantly slowed by the lack of common means to test and compare protocols under realistic environmental conditions. This infrastructure responds to the need for consensus on analytic or simulation models for underwater networks where researchers need the ability to gather experimental data under real world conditions in order to make progress. <br/><br/>The network stack will be modular by design with sockets used to enable cross layer control and communication. The physical, MAC, Network and Application layers will be populated with sample components to enable users test their own algorithms or protocols without having to populate the entire stack. Users will be able to write modules to test their own algorithms or protocols at different layers and selectively replace the sample modules with their own. While the development of the modular architecture and sample modules for the network stack will be done with close coordination between all participating institutions, the lead institution for the layers that will be provided are Physical Layer (MIT for the all-layer system, WHOI for the Fixed-PHY system), MAC Layer (USC/ISI), Network Layer (UConn, a geo-routing protocol), and Application Layer (UMass, a DTN routine service). The open characteristic of the testbeds and their usefulness for conducting research will be demonstrated by the members of the team (primarily UConn and UMass as described above) and a few selected outside participants. In addition, acoustic receptions suitable for physical layer research will be made available to the general research community via the Internet. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: This work enables the essential capability of research groups to examine fundamental research questions and their potential solutions in the real world. The infrastructure will directly benefit many on-going research projects in this field  A large number of potential users in the community may benefit from this testbed infrastructure. In addition to the significant research impact, the infrastructure is expected to make a very strong educational impact as well, supporting classes bringing remote access to field experiments to students for whom traditional experiments would have been too costly. The infrastructure can accelerate research and education in the underwater networking field.

The PIs will develop a theory of design decisions and based on the theory, a design-by-example methodology.<br/>Design decisions will be mathematically formalized as operations on attribute sets, which are used to represent the possibilities of the designed artifact along multiple dimensions. Groups of attributes can be combined into hierarchically structured and reusable design spaces. An important aspect is the explicit representation of design contexts to capture design constraints and external requirements properly. Design spaces can be further composed and modeled by relating design decisions to other design spaces and by integrating them with design contexts through constraints. In this model any design will be represented as a point in the design space, and ?design by example? means to navigate from one point to another by reversing design decisions and replacing them with different ones.<br/>The broad impacts of this research include the application of the design theory to real application environments. A major challenge will be to demonstrate that the proposed design methodology can be successfully applied in practice and that the developed theory provides insights that support real-world design tasks.  The PIs will perform exploratory research to establish a set of important real-world scenarios and example projects that can serve both as an evaluation testbed and as a guide when developing the theory. Letters of intent to participate in the research are included in the proposal from companies in the aerospace industry and NASA.<br/>This research will also have a positive impact on the education of students that either directly participate in this project or will be exposed to the research through graduate level courses. Moreover, educational outreach will include high school students that participate as summer interns.<br/><br/>

On the defensive side, a fundamental limitation of traditional host-based anti-malware systems is that they run inside the very hosts they are protecting, making them vulnerable to malware's counter-detection and subversion. To address this limitation, solutions using virtual machine (VM) technologies advocate placing the malware detection facility outside of the protected VM. However, a dilemma exists between these two approaches: The out of the box approach gains tamper resistance at the cost of losing the native, semantic view of the host enjoyed by the in the box approach. To resolve the above dilemma, a new approach called OBSERV (Out of the Box with SEmantically Reconstructed View) is introduced to achieve the advantages of both camps by reconstructing the semantic internal view of a VM from external, low-level observations. OBSERV enables two exciting malware defense opportunities: (1) malware detection by view comparison and (2) real-time detection and stoppage of kernel-level rootkits. The broader impact of this research is two-fold: (1) It will enhance the trustworthiness and effectiveness of widely deployed anti-malware systems. Moreover, OBSERV is expected to be viewed favorably by the anti-virus software industry because of its support for existing off-the-shelf anti-virus software. (2) Results from this research will lead to the development of education materials for undergraduate and graduate courses and for professional training sessions.

The pursuit of this ambitious objective relies on novel ideas fostering a paradigm shift in embedded software design by integrating control with software design. In particular, through the use of finite abstractions of continuous control systems, control theoretic ideas are being applied to the design of software enforcing dynamic constraints (control), software constraints (e.g., shared resources, real-time properties) and hardware constraints (e.g., power consumption, execution times). In addition to alleviating the need for testing and formal verification this research is also developing automated synthesis methods allowing for faster design cycles and an increase in functionality and complexity of embedded applications. This correct by construction approach to embedded control software design has immediate technological, economical and societal consequences triggered by a reduction in software development time and cost. Furthermore, the research outcome of this project is also contributing to the advancement in functionality, robustness and dependability of the large networks of embedded systems that are becoming essential infrastructures of our society. Important contributions to graduate and undergraduate education complement the research component of the project. A new graduate course on verification and synthesis of embedded control systems is being offered at Notre Dame. The lecture notes supporting this course will be published to further disseminate the novel ideas developed in the context of this project and to promote the creation of similar courses in other universities. Undergraduate education at Notre Dame is being improved through the participation of undergraduate students in research and by revising the laboratorial component of the introductory course to electrical networks in order to familiarize second year electrical engineering students with embedded systems and basic skills in embedded programming.

The project achieves its goal using the following approaches: (1) Develop an architectural framework supporting the interoperation of security services. The framework combines the service oriented architecture paradigm with the event-based model and also includes a context-management service; (2) Develop an identity management service based on the life-cycle of digital identities;(3) Develop an authentication service supporting multi-factor authentication policies;(4) Develop a privacy-aware role-based access control (RBAC) service able to support content-based authorization;(5) Develop policy modularization and policy activation/deactivation mechanisms to support emergency situations and the ''break-the-glass'' principle that are relevant for eHealth applications; and (6) Prototype the framework and the services and integrate them with a Web-based prototype of a Personal Health Record (PHR) management system being developed by one of the Co-PIs.<br/><br/>The results of the project will benefit the IT providers of eHealth solutions by offering enhanced architectural solutions for security and privacy, as well as insights about their complexity, their manageability and their interoperability. The results will provide useful insights for those eHealth IT providers wanting to evaluate the feasibility of the ''Software As A Service'' (SAAS) model for  security and privacy, as well as for IT security managers of caregiver organizations.  This project supports Ph.D and master students  to pursue research in security architectures and services, and in advanced IT systems for eHealth. Several course modules will be developed based on the project results, including modules on: HIPAA - Security and Privacy Requirements; Security Architectures for eHealth; Security as a Service - Concepts,  Architectures, and Techniques. Publications, technical reports, and software from this research will be disseminated via the project web site (http://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/bertino/IIS-eHealth)

The conference brings together indigenous scholars working on their own languages, other Latin American scholars working on the languages of the region, and scholars from the U.S., Europe, and elsewhere who work on Latin American indigenous languages. Four keynote speakers have been invited and 46 papers have been accepted.<br/><br/>This conference contributes to the exchange of information among these scholars, to linguistic and international activities at the University of Texas at Austin, and to the continuing education of speakers of indigenous languages who are engaged in linguistic research. Because they come from many different countries, it is difficult for scholars who work on these languages to meet.  CILLA-III gives them the opportunity to do so, thereby creating a valuable research network among U.S. and Latin American scholars.

The project collects and uses survey data from random samples of Mexican households and interviews conducted with Mexican policymakers to investigate three central questions: (1) When forced to confront an economic shock, are households without reliable access to social welfare programs more likely to receive remittances? (2) Are remittance-receiving households less resistant to destabilizing market-oriented policies than non-recipients, controlling for relevant factors? (3) Are the efforts of developing country governments to facilitate emigration and attract remittances pursued as a de facto social policy, implemented by policymakers with the aim of limiting political fallout from constraints on their ability to spend large amounts of money on social welfare programs? This study contributes to political science debates about the impact and feasibility of market reform and globalization in developing countries by, for the first time in this literature, analyzing the social insurance role played by migrant-remittances.  Furthermore, this proposal provides a novel macro-level perspective to debates among anthropologists, economists, and sociologists about the functions of migrant-remittances in developing countries.  <br/><br/>This research project also has broader social impacts.  Although migration is a bilateral phenomenon that is most effectively managed when migrant-sending and migrant-receiving governments work together, policymakers in the developed world have generally dealt with migration issues unilaterally via immigration control policies.  This study provides policy experts on both sides of the border a new perspective about how emigration serves households and politicians in developing countries.  By understanding these dynamics, opportunities for bilateral dialogues can be enhanced and more effective bilateral solutions become possible. This broader social impacts occur through: the dissemination of this study's data and findings to Mexican and US policy experts; the establishment of new relationships between Mexican and US scholars in the process of conducting field research; the integration of the marginalized perspectives and insights of Mexican researchers, Mexican policy-makers, and Mexican emigrant-households into the US immigration debate via publications that result from this field project.

The mechanism of taste involves a metabolomic fingerprint of the solution, and in many cases the sense of taste can distinguish subtly different mixtures, as well as differentiate minor differences in chemical structures.  Most tastants, and odorants as well, are identified through a composite of responses from non-specific interactions.  The pattern created by the simultaneous response of a series of differential receptors is specific for a particular set of stimuli. For example, wine tasters are able to distinguish very subtle taste characteristics as a key to the success of their careers.<br/>Our plan is to use wine as a test-bed solution to optimize the art of differential sensing techniques.  The reason for our choice of wine is its complexity and the very unique chemical structures.  Further, wine is an excellent choice because human test panels are available for comparison to our artificial approach.  We propose to target several classes of analytes present in wine: carboxylic acids, sugars, and tannins (and analogs). These classes present interesting challenges for molecular recognition and fingerprinting.  We will use in-hand receptors for carboxylates and sugars.  Alternatively, the receptors for the tannins will be derived from combinatorial chemistry.  Further, we plan to create specific receptors for those components of wine known to have health advantages: resveratrol and quercetin.<br/>To accomplish our goals, a collaboration has been established between Dr. Eric Anslyn at the University of Texas at Austin and Dr. Hildegarde Heymann at the University of California Davis.  Dr. Anslyn will create the complex organic receptors, the signaling protocols, and apply the appropriate pattern recognition protocols.  Dr. Heymann will use more standard approaches to metabolomic profiling, and will oversee trained human test panels.  The data collected at U.T. and U.C.D. will be used to answer several questions as described herein, a few of which are: 1) How many receptors, and what structures, are needed to accomplish the fingerprinting of our analyte classes? 2) What correlations will we find between fingerprints of the analyte classes created at U.T. and at U.C.D., 3) Will specific chemicals dominate the fingerprints and test panel responses at U.C.D., 4) Will specific chemicals found important to the U.C.D. fingerprints be evident in the U.T. fingerprints, even if we did not train on those specific chemicals, 5) Which chemical fingerprints found at either U.C.D. or U.T. will best reflect the sensory panel input, and 6) Can fingerprints found at U.T. be used in a predictive manner for sensory panel response.<br/>The broad impact of this proposal resides in exploring a general approach that can have impact on the fields of medical, environmental, defense, and food diagnostics.  We feel that the power of an array of synthetic receptors, when coupled with pattern recognition protocols, cannot be surpassed for array sensor applications.  In practice, synthetic receptors suffer interference from similar analytes due to their simplicity. Therefore, synthetic receptors are naturally cross-reactive, the exact attribute that is desired in an array setting. We predict that this attribute of synthetic receptors will allow chemists to use them to analyze solutions for which the components are not exactly known. Furthermore, the use of synthetic combinatorial chemistry in the creation of unnatural receptors naturally compliments this requirement of cross-reactivity.  The big-picture goal of this proposal is to teach this lesson to supramolecular and analytical chemists, while the choice of wine to prove the techniques leads to a general societal interest and dissemination of the results in non-traditional academic media.<br/><br/>

Because of the important role of declarative knowledge in intelligent behavior, the theory of knowledge representation is a key part of artificial intelligence. Nonmonotonic knowledge representation languages are particularly valuable in view of the fact that they allow reasoning about defaults and exceptions. Research on nonmonotonic knowledge representation is becoming increasingly experimental and applied, in connection with the emergence of efficient answer set solvers--software systems for computing stable models.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to reformulate the semantics of variables in nonmonotonic logic in a way that will bring this theory closer to the reality of state-of-the-art implementations. This will be achieved using a new definition of a stable model that is based on translating logic programs with variables into classical logic. This work seeks to clarify and simplify the semantics of several knowledge representation languages that are used in applications of artificial intelligence to many areas of science and technology.<br/><br/>

Traditionally, nodes in distributed systems deviate from their specification because they are broken (e.g., because of  bugs, hardware failures, configuration errors, or even malicious attacks). MAD systems add a new dimension: without a central administrator ensuring that each unbroken node follows the assigned protocol, nodes may deviate to selfishly maximize their utility.<br/><br/>Byzantine Fault Tolerance handles broken nodes well. However, the Byzantine model classifies all deviations as faults and requires a bound on the number of faults that is impossible to establish when nodes can be selfish. Conversely, traditional game-theoretic models handle selfish nodes well, but are vulnerable to arbitrary disruptions if even one broken node behaves irrationally.<br/><br/>The goal of the FuDiCo III  international workshop, held from June 4th to June 7th 2007, is to identify the conceptual and practical foundations on which to build dependable MAD distributed systems.   The workshop, the third in the prestigious Future of Distributed Computing (FuDiCo) series, brings together leading senior researchers and promising graduate students from different areas  (security, distributed computing, artificial intelligence, networking, and economics) for a ?multicultural? approach to this challenging and multi-faceted problem.  The objective is to produce a series of written reports (targeted for  SIGACT and SIGOPS News) that provide a snapshot of the current research in the area and identify promising avenues for future research.

The central idea is to coordinate network transmissions so they are 'aligned' with the character of the traffic and environment.<br/><br/>The research leverages data mining techniques to generate coarse traffic abstractions, capturing the salient characteristics of the spatio-temporally-diverse traffic and environment. These abstract traffic loads drive a slower time-scale system-level optimization of coordinated transmission schedules across neighboring base stations, while allowing faster (local) dynamic scheduling driven by the realizations of individual user traffic and dynamic interference. The research draws on tools from adaptive, robust and stochastic optimization for both analysis and algorithmic development. The research agenda is unique in that it develops an integrated view and foundational design principles needed to realize the coupling of individual user dynamics with problems ranging from measuring and abstracting user population traffic/environment to network coordination. Preliminary results suggest that this approach has the potential to enable substantial reductions in interference and average power usage, while increasing coverage and service uniformity.<br/><br/>This work can drive beneficial changes in current and future wireless technologies and standards. U.T. Austin's Wireless Networking and Communications Group's (WNCG) strong ties with industry provide concrete opportunities for this work to have a broader impact. In addition, this project includes education-based initiatives, including curriculum development, training of graduate students, and involvement of undergraduates, exposing them to research and industry in an integrated manner.<br/>

Ellison <br/>Co-Principal Investigator: Michael Roemer<br/><br/>Abstract<br/><br/>In recent decades, scholars have analyzed associations between religion and well-being among predominantly Christian populations in the United States. Overall, this body of work suggests that aspects of religious involvement have salutary implications for psychological well-being. Although these research findings are compelling, it remains unclear whether they are generalizable to other religious traditions, in quite different social and cultural contexts. To address this issue, this dissertation examines connections between religious practices and beliefs and well-being in Japan.  This research incorporates multiple methods, including focus groups and in-depth interviews as well as psychometric testing and multivariate analyses of data from self-administered mail surveys designed by the author and from large national datasets, to interpret intersections between individual religiosity and depression, anxiety, sense of mastery, social support, life satisfaction, and happiness. <br/><br/>The multi-method approach and topic of this study are expected to provide a broader understanding of how religiosity is connected to well-being in contemporary Japan and how underlying mechanisms that help explain these associations may differ from previous U.S.-based research. Furthermore, this project analyzes and reveals some of the key means by which Japanese express, interpret, and maintain psychological wellness, providing us with more insight into cultural variations of mental health.  Another goal is to advance quantitative measures of religiosity in Japan and add them to on-going surveys in the future, thus enabling researchers to study correlations between religious acts and beliefs and a variety of outcomes, such as attitudes, behaviors, and orientations. Finally, because the religious traditions of neighboring countries such as China and South Korea resemble Japan in terms of their emphasis on local and contextualized rituals and de-emphasis on religious organizational adherence and monotheistic beliefs, it is expected that both the process and results of asking culturally specific questions can inform investigations of religion in other societies as well. In these ways this study aims to make unique empirical, theoretical, and methodological contributions to our overall understanding of religiosity and spirituality, well-being, and intersections between these social forces.<br/><br/>
0712097	RI: Learning Language Semantics from Perceptual Context	IIS	ROBUST INTELLIGENCE	09/01/2007	08/29/2008	Raymond Mooney	TX	University of Texas at Austin	Continuing grant	Tatiana D. Korelsky	08/31/2011	$443,535.00		mooney@cs.utexas.edu	3925 W Braker Lane, Ste 3.11072	Austin	TX	787595316	5124716424	CSE	7495	7495, 9218, HPCC	$0.00	This project develops systems that use machine learning to construct semantic analyzers for natural language by training on sentences paired only with their perceptual context. The PI's previous research developed systems that acquire semantic parsers by training on sentences annotated with formal meaning representations; however, the demands of building such annotated corpora limit the scope and accuracy of the resulting systems.  This project extends these methods to learn language more like a human child, using only exposure to utterances in context. In order to temporarily circumvent the limitations of existing computer-vision and robotic systems, the project primarily studies the problem in simulated environments.  It uses the Robocup soccer simulator as one domain in which to explore language acquisition.  Existing methods for abstracting a description from the physical simulator state are used to construct a symbolic representation of the perceptual context.  When learning from perceptual context instead of direct supervision, a system must address referential uncertainty, i.e. a sentence may refer to a multitude of different aspects of the current environment.<br/>Consequently, this project designs, implements, and evaluates algorithms that can learn from sentences paired only with ambiguous supervision. The effectiveness of the techniques developed are evaluated in experiments in the Robocup environment and other applications.  The techniques developed can eventually be ported to real robots, allowing for an integration of language and perception in robotics.  By increasing our understanding of how language can be acquired from its use in context, the project should also provide insight into human language learning.<br/><br/>

Batory<br/>University of Texas at Austin<br/><br/>Today's programmers wrestle with a bewildering number of languages, tools, programming concepts, and representations. Instinctively we sense familiar ideas are reinvented and reimplemented in different contexts, in different languages, with different implementations, and on different platforms. The result is overwhelming complexity, steep learning curves, and the inability to create customized software cheaply. This research exposes fundamental principles that underlie different threads of research in program development and maintenance to create a general theory of automated software development that ultimately will reduce complexity, be easier to learn, and will enable customized software to be created inexpensively.<br/><br/>Architectural Metaprogramming is the idea that programs (or program designs and program structures) are first-class entities that are manipulated by transformations. Programs are values, transformations map programs to other programs, and operators map transformations to transformations. The result is an algebra of programs: programs can be added, subtracted, and transformed. The algebra unifies important areas of software design in a very teachable way: refactorings are behavior-preserving program transformations, feature-based and aspect-oriented software synthesis use behavior-extending program transformations, and model-driven design exploits both to map platform-independent models to platform-specific models. The result of our work is a foundation for a new paradigm, languages, and tools for low-cost automated software design and development. The short-term impact of our work will be in software engineering education, where refactorings, features, aspects, and model-driven design can be presented as a coherent and integrated discipline; the longer-term impact will be on tools and languages in commercial software development.<br/>

However, there is an urgent need to incorporate reliability requirements to these frameworks, in view of the ever-increasing transient fault rates linked to scaled technology sizes and reduced design margins. This is particularly important for safety-critical real-time embedded systems.  Recent reports indicating that the problem is exacerbated by the widely-popular energy management technique, dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS), which has an alarmingly negative effect on system reliability because of increased transient fault rates associated with operation at low supply voltages.<br/><br/>This project undertakes a comprehensive study of the interplay between energy management and transient fault recovery in real-time embedded systems. First, a generalized transient fault model for DVFS-enabled systems is being developed that considers the effects of radiation, temperature and electromagnetic interference. Second, focusing on operating-system-level algorithms and tools, the project is developing an integrated, reliability-aware power management framework for different types of embedded and real-time systems.  The framework enables a trade-off analysis for energy savings and aggregate reliability to be carried out. Adaptive schemes that dynamically improve the system performance by monitoring system's execution at run-time are also investigated.  The project is expected to have a substantial technological impact as energy-efficiency and reliability are known to be fundamental requirements for next generation real-time and embedded systems.<br/>

They are piecewise constant approximations of the true models - integral equation models. The discrete models impose bottleneck model errors which cannot be compensated from the numerical methods developed based upon them. To overcome this drawback, the PIs propose to directly use the integral equation models for image processing. The integral equation models will offer us much greater flexibility for the in-depth analysis of the corresponding images. An ideal method for image processing should be sensitive to geometric features of images and computationally efficient. Presently, the total variation method and the multiscale method are two main mathematical approaches for image processing. They are complementary to each other in their strength and weakness. The total variation method is sensitive to geometric features of images but it is computationally inefficient. The standard multiscale method is convenient for computation due to its multiscale structure but it is not very sensitive to the geometric features of images. Aiming at designing computationally efficient algorithms that are sensitive to geometric features of images, the PIs propose to develop multiscale total variation methods which combine the strengths from both of these two methods. The PIs study the following four mathematical problems related to image processing: (1) Multiscale approximation of images based on integral equation models; (2) Multiscale total variation regularization; (3) Missing data recovery with redundant systems; and (4) Design of application-driven wavelet and framelet filter banks.  <br/><br/><br/>Image processing arises in a variety of scientific, medical and engineering applications. Specifically, applications in medical sciences and technologies range from computer tomography to diagnoses of diseases, applications in environmental sciences include natural resources and pollution control via satellite imaging, applications in art sciences have vision analysis and digital restorations of cracked ancient paintings in digitized fine art museums and applications in security identification include weapon, fingerprints and face identifications.  In these applications, a key issue is restorating images from available data. This is an ill-posed problem. Solving this problem needs advanced mathematical models and efficient computational algorithms. The main objective of this proposal directly addresses this issue by proposing multiscale total variation methods for integral equation models in image processing. The projects in the proposal will enhance the integration of high level pure mathematics with the contemporary digital and computer technology. These projects will train graduate studetns in this important area to prepare them to face the mathematical and computational challenge in future scientifical and technological development. Moreover, th PIs will develop a multidisciplinary course for upper level undergraduate students based on research results of these projects. <br/>

Such obligatory actions are integral<br/>to the security procedures of many enterprises. The management of<br/>obligations in security policies imposes significant technical<br/>challenges since obligations bear quite different properties from<br/>traditional access control. For example, obligations assigned to<br/>users often cannot be enforced. Thus, even if a system°Øs reference<br/>monitor is trusted, the failure of obligations must be considered,<br/>and appropriate remedies need to be an integral part of security<br/>policies. Also, the interaction between obligations and other<br/>components of security policies (e.g., access control) must be<br/>considered to ensure their consistency.<br/><br/>This project develops a comprehensive framework for the management<br/>of obligations in security policies, which covers the full life<br/>cycle of obligations, including obligation modeling, specification,<br/>analysis, monitoring and discharges. Specifically, the project<br/>formally identifies the desirable security objectives that are<br/>characteristic of systems that involve obligations, and<br/>systematically investigates dynamic and static means to maintaining<br/>these objectives while such systems evolve. Though the framework is<br/>formal in nature, and is designed on purpose to be general, the<br/>evaluation of its usefulness and effectiveness is firmly grounded on<br/>real applications, in particular, in the context of privacy policy<br/>enforcement in health care systems.<br/><br/>This project aims to establish a solid foundation for the management<br/>of obligations, and significantly improve the understanding and<br/>practice of obligations in information systems. The societal benefit<br/>of the project also results from the development and dissemination<br/>of education resources on new types of security policies beyond<br/>traditional access control.

The AUV will be used for coral reef benthic surveys on the insular shelf and slope, as well as other benthic habitats.

The modular development improves the transportability of the approach since a new course in GIS technologies is not required for adoption by other programs but the modules can be used to reinforce basic concepts throughout the curriculum in a comprehensive manner. The GIS applications are in the areas of environmental, geotechnical, hydrology, surveying, and transportation. Since these topics are standard topics in civil engineering programs nationwide, there is the potential for a large impact on undergraduate education through this project. GIS applications enable faculty to bring realistic applications into the classroom in ways that are not possible through traditional instruction. Further, GIS is an increasingly important topic in civil engineering and it is a subject that is largely ignored in the curriculum, so this project fills a need within the civil engineering community.

The PI's will collocate GPS sites at seismic stations operated by the Puerto Rico Seismic Network and the Puerto Rico Strong Motion Program.  Installation of the network at remote field sites will be accomplished with UNAVCO engineering assistance.  Data from the GPS network will record long-period (minutes) seismic waves as a possible means for detecting tsunamigenic earthquakes.   Broadband seismometers are generally unable to capture the full bandwidth of long period ground motions following very large earthquakes (e.g., the Dec. 26, 2004, Mw 9.2Andaman Islands-Sumatra Earthquake) and it is therefore difficult to rapidly estimate the true magnitude of megaquakes using only seismic data.  Estimation of the true magnitude (and therefore tsunami potential) of large earthquakes may be determined more accurately in a timely manner (minutes after the quake) using high rate GPS observations.  Given that Puerto Rico is situated on a fault block between the North American and Caribbean tectonic plates and is surrounded and intersected by a series of active faults, seismic events are common and major earthquakes (Mw>7.0) in the region have generated tsunamis in the past (e.g., 1946 Mw 8.0 Hispaniola earthquakes).   The proposed GPS network will complement the existing Puerto Rico Seismic Network and the Puerto Rico Strong Motion Program, both operating within the University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez.  The high-rate GPS network will enable geoscientists to record long-period and permanent ground motion information that cannot be addressed using current seismometers in the region.  The proposed integrated velocitymeter-accelerometer-GPS earthquake observation system will advance knowledge of seismic wave propagation, the kinematics and dynamics of fault rupture process, pre-seismic, co-seismic and post-seismic deformation, and is also likely to be useful for improving building and critical structure designs.  The integrated GPS/seismometer network will support earthquake and tsunami hazards research and mitigation in Puerto Rico and the surrounding region.   Data from GPS observations can and will also be used for real time tropospheric water vapor tomography which can be useful for weather prediction, including improved hurricane track forecasting.  Raw GPS data will be freely available through the UNAVCO archive.  As a result, a large number of faculty and students can potentially benefit from the data for research and applications ranging from neotectonics to atmospheric science to civil engineering.  The University of Puerto Rico Mayaguez (UPRM) intend to engage a UPR student in the development of the network.   UPRM is non-Ph.D.-granting, an EPSCoR (Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research) and Hispanic serving institution.

Because sclersosponges can live for >1000 years, and their aragonite geochemistry is in isotopic equilibrium with seawater, the skeletons contain an invaluable archive of continuous near surface environmental conditions during the Holocene. When oxygen isotope and trace element data are collected from a suite of specimens, it is possible to reconstruct water column temperature and salinity as a function of depth and time. Funds from this SGER will be used to locate and collect sclerosponges from a 200 m depth transect along Desecheo Island, Puerto Rico, using mixed-gas/rebreather diving technology (to 100 m) and an ROV (100-200 m depth). The Caribbean Coral Reef Institutes will provide the ROV to this project at no cost to NSF. Collected sclerosponges will be dated using U/Th and analyzed for their skeletal geochemistry to calibration and validate the geochemical proxies for paleothermometry.

Methods for their structural characterization need further development. This research is focused on the structure determination of modulated crystals of profilin:actin. The objectives of this research are two-fold; first, to continue to develop new macromolecular X-ray crystallographic methods for the structure solution of aperiodic, modulated crystals, and second, to test the hypothetical model that the actin ''ribbon'' found in PA crystals represents a structural intermediate of filamentous actin. This research will employ protein crystal growth, X-ray diffraction data collection and structure determination. At several points during the project, innovative approaches to protein crystallography and software will be developed. The unique diffraction pattern from the modulated crystals contains unusual off-lattice satellite reflections next to the main reflections. Strategies for collecting X-ray diffraction data that detect and separate satellite reflections from the main reflections will be developed. Downstream of data collection, existing software from chemical (AKA small molecule) crystallography will be adapted and used to process the modulated diffraction pattern. From the diffraction data, the type and direction of the modulation(s) will be determined. Then additional chemical crystallography software will be extensively modified and combined with macromolecular algorithms to solve the modulated crystallographic phase problem, produce multidimensional electron density images and refine the modulated atomic structure against the experimental diffraction data. Finally, the resulting structure(s) will be analyzed within the framework of the current cell biology literature. It is anticipated that these structural results will test the validity of the ribbon-to-helix model of actin filament formation. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/>Research will be integrated with education through partnership with the University of Nebraska-Omaha to develop undergraduate research internships and coursework in protein purification and crystallization with profilin:actin as a central theme; the formation of ''Graduate Student Training Program in Structural Biology and Biophysics'' at UNMC; supporting national conference workshops on how to solve modulated structures for the continued education of chemical and macromolecular crystallographers at all levels; and the incorporation of research results and methods into graduate-level coursework. The PI's laboratory provides a diverse and multicultural environment for the participation of underrepresented students at all levels of training in this research program.

This process has been examined by two of the investigators of the team (Gower and Colfen), for both inorganic and organic materials, and has the potential to provide new biomimetic processing strategies for advanced materials. Some potential applications of this process include the development of biomimetic bone, biodegradable microcapsules for controlled release, and other biomaterial applications requiring benign processing conditions for sensitive biocomponents. The US team is led by Laurie Gower, Associate Professor of Materials Science and Engineering (University of Florida), whose research program in biomimetic materials chemistry, is centered around the non-classical PILP crystallization process that is the focus of this US-German network. The PILP process appears to be broadly applicable, in which preliminary studies find that it can be induced in a variety of inorganic materials, as well as organic crystals of amino acids. Although formation of PILP phases has now been observed under many different experimental conditions- the fundamental physicochemical properties, and the stability and transformation mechanisms of this unusual phase are largely unresolved and will be the focus of this project.  The German team consists of Dirk Volkmer (University of Ulm) and Helmut Colfen (Max Planck Institute of Colloids and Interfaces). Volkmer's group has prepared novel amphiphiles and polymer brushes as templates for mineral deposition, and is well recognized for their mechanistic studies on the growth of calcium carbonate crystals beneath Langmuir monolayers.  Colfen's group is well recognized for their studies of non-classical crystallization processes, and have made seminal contributions to the study of PILP systems, demonstrating that organic PILPs can also be formed. Both labs have unique analytical capabilities for examining the thermodynamics and interfacial phenomena of this unusual crystallization process.  <br/>The MWN project consists of three thrusts, centered around the primary expertise of the three principal investigators.  The first thrust examines the fundamental thermodynamics and kinetics of PILP formation, using microcalorimetry, ultracentrifugation, and in situ chemical titrations; and ternary phase diagrams will first be determined for the simpler organic PILP systems, to correlate lattice energy parameters with the capability of forming PILP phases. The second thrust develops a technique for capturing and stabilizing the labile PILP phase, which is needed for determination of the rheological properties and spectroscopic analysis of this unusual phase. Co-investigators, Roger Tran-Son-Tay (Professor of Mechanical Engineering, U. of Florida), will provide the micro-rheological instruments and expertise for examining the fluidic character and solidification kinetics of the captured PILP phase; and Joanna Long (Associate Professor of Molecular and Cellular Biochemistry) will provide NMR expertise for examining molecular interactions within the accumulated precursor phase, and relaxation time experiments to examine the solidification kinetics.  The third thrust examines the influence of Langmuir monolayers, as well as immobilized self-assembled monolayers, with well-defined surface chemistries and structure, on the transformation of the precursor phase. This interfacial aspect is important for stabilizing the pseudomorphic transformation, as well as regulating crystallographic properties (phase, orientation, texture, and morphology).  This Materials World Network encompasses training for both graduate and undergraduate level students, with particular benefits from the integration of research and training in an international environment. In the latter case, materials chemistry projects will be advertised to the undergraduate students of the respective institutions, and top ranked students will be selected to participate in the program during the summer of their junior year, facilitating international networking between the next generation of Materials Scientists.  <br/><br/>This award is co-funded with the Office of International Science and Engineering.<br/>

To invigorate courses in discrete mathematics and computer science, this project is developing modular course materials based on primary historical sources that highlight or illuminate the discovery of certain concepts underlying finite mathematics and algorithmic thought. An initial set of twenty to twenty-five historical projects ranging from a beginning to an advanced undergraduate level comprise an interdisciplinary resource guide for use in a variety of mathematics and computer science courses. A web-based version is also available as an online resource. A network of faculty at a diverse set of institutions is classroom testing the material, with testers also signing on to create their own modules to contribute to the main resource guide. The intellectual merit of the proposal lies in providing motivation, perspective, and direction to these courses in finite mathematics, combinatorics, algorithm design, data structures, logic, abstract algebra, and automata theory via an examination of primary historical sources that compelled the development of these subjects. The broader impacts of the proposal include: external site testing at a diverse collection of institutions, from community colleges to four-year liberal arts colleges to large public universities; the development of faculty expertise in the use of historical projects; and the education of pre-service teachers in mathematics with projects. The two lead institutions also have a significant Hispanic student enrollment, which further increases the project's potential for broader impacts.<br/>

Lutz	10/31/2009	$106,587.00		aaradill@ssc.wisc.edu	Off. of Research & Proj. Admin.	Princeton	NJ	085442020	6092583090	SBE	1320	0000, OTHR	$0.00	This project is devoted to the econometric study of models where economic agents (individuals, firms, unions, governments, etc.) interact with each other in an incomplete information environment.  In these settings, each agent's observed behavior is at least partially determined by her subjective and unobserved (to the researcher) beliefs about the expected choices of others. The vast majority of existing econometric work for these models assumes that unobserved beliefs are consistent with equilibrium behavior, which imposes extreme assumptions about agents' rationality and jeopardizes the robustness and validity of the estimation results. This project weakens this restrictive assumption and assumes instead that agents' unobserved beliefs are only rationalizable in the sense that they do not assign positive probability to opponents' actions that are strictly dominated. The notion of rationalizability has been thoroughly studied by game theorists but has not ?until now- been formally incorporated into econometric analysis.  It includes equilibrium beliefs as a special case, but allows for a wide range of alternative behavior.<br/><br/>Methodologically, this research project is two-pronged. First, it characterizes which statistical features of a given model can be identified under the sole assumption of rationalizable beliefs. Second, it develops statistical methods for estimation and inference of the identified features.  Using observed behavior and other observable features of agents (if any), these methods shed light on questions such as: How much are agents' actions affected by the expected choices of others if their beliefs are only assumed to satisfy a minimal rationality requirement? Can an upper bound for rationality be identified? Can Nash equilibrium be ruled out? What pieces of available information do agents use to construct their beliefs? Counterfactual exercises (e.g, the effect of hypothetical policy analysis) under flexible behavioral assumptions are also made possible. The methods can be applied to a wide variety of real-world settings, including: Auctions, market entry/exit, interaction among firms, location models for firms or individuals, models of individual choices with peer-effects, etc. They are also especially amenable to experimental data sets, whose availability has been steadily increasing in the recent past. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts of Research Project:<br/>The broader impact if the project goes beyond contributing new methods to the existing literature and attracting the attention of research experts in the subject. A major goal is the design of courses, workshops and seminars aimed not only to advanced economics doctoral students, but to students and researchers of other social science disciplines interested in estimation and inference in interactions-based models. These courses would study not only the theory, but also the methodological and computational issues involved in the implementation of these methods to real data. They will be complemented by workshops, seminars and lectures by prominent experts in the subject. This project is designed to bring together game theorists, econometricians, applied economists and decision-makers in need of policy analysis in complicated interactions settings under flexible behavioral assumptions.  All computer data programs, lecture notes and research papers which will result from this project will be widely disseminated.   <br/>

This project focuses on high-level specification of events and activities in sensor networks, since sensor networks are typically deployed for collaborative detection of events and activities.  In particular, the project uses a declarative programming framework based on probabilistic logic for high-level specification of events in sensor networks. The probability distributions embedded in the user program are automatically learnt from training examples using standard machine learning techniques.  The above approach facilitates high-level specification of sensor network applications, which is automatically translated into low-level distributed code running on individual sensor nodes. The user is thus freed from the burden of<br/>worrying about low-level details.<br/><br/>The project focuses on the following three goals.  The first goal is development of a query engine for efficient distributed evaluation of probabilistic deductive queries in sensor networks.  The second goal is to develop techniques for efficient estimation (and distributed re-estimation) of probability distributions embedded in the given program. The third goal is to test the viability of the developed techniques by building two appropriate testbeds.  The research project has a significant impact on the ease of programming various sensor network applications.

The proposed experiments are intended to make fundamental advances in understanding the nature of self-control and intelligence, especially: a) how they are related to each other; b) the information processing and neural mechanisms that support them; and c) how they influence and are influenced by emotion or affect. Sometimes excess emotion needs to be regulated to behave more optimally (e.g., to resist temptation and impulsive responding), and sometimes the opposite is true: affect can help people behave more optimally (e.g., being mildly anxious about a test can lead to better preparation). The PI's prior work has sought to establish that cognitive and affective aspects of the human mind and brain are integrated in a deep sense, that is, cognition and emotion are not completely separable. In turn, such integration strongly suggests that affect cannot be fully separated from intelligent behavior, including self-control and even logical reasoning. The PI will conduct behavioral, brain imaging, and molecular genetic studies of self-control, as well as a classroom-based intervention to teach Emotional Literacy skills and evaluate the influence of that intervention on self-control and intelligence as outcome measures. If successful, the proposed research will provide a strong basis for follow-up studies into the roles of frustration tolerance, math anxiety, and stereotype threat during STEM learning.<br/><br/>Broader impacts. The research described in this proposal will be the core activity of a training program, based in the PI's laboratory at Yale University, intended to increase research capacity in the cognitive neuroscience of science education. The results will add momentum to a major conceptual shift at the core of conceptions of human intelligence, especially the role of affect and self-control. By extension, it has the potential to positively influence educational curriculum and policy. The activity will engage diverse undergraduate and graduate students, and post-doctoral fellows in developing their skills in cognitive neuroscience research, classroom research, and science communication. The PI will visit schools in Kent, U.K., to gain a greater cultural perspective and to contribute to international scientific dialog on affect, self-control, and intelligence. <br/>

Typical examples of identities include your name and your social-security number, or your fingerprint/iris-scan, or your address, or your (non-revoked) Public-Key coming from some trusted public-key infrastructure. In many situations, however, where you are defines your identity. For example, we know the role of a bank-teller behind a bullet-proof bank window not because he or she shows us her<br/>credentials but by merely knowing her location. In this proposal, we ask the following question: is it possible to have the geographical position of a party take part in defining the set of credentials<br/>she has? What are the new possibilities in terms of what we can achieve in this setting?<br/><br/>First, we propose to consider the central task in this setting, i.e.,<br/>securely verifying the position of a device. Despite much work in this area, we have preliminary results that show that in the vanilla (i.e., standard) model, the above task (i.e., of secure<br/>positioning) is impossible to achieve.<br/><br/>We  propose to study the proof of position in the bounded storage model (i.e. where we assume some bound on the total memory of the adversary).<br/>In this setting, we wish to achieve   two tasks: secure positioning, and position-based key exchange. While the question of secure positioning has been asked in the past, no satisfactory answers exist. <br/><br/>The second question (of position-based key exchange) has not been asked in the past. We also ask a broader question: whether position-based Secure Multi-Party Computation can be achieved in this setting.<br/><br/><br/><br/>

The approach is to use probabilistic modeling of the heterogeneous, interdependent infrastructure, power and telecommunication systems. Analytical and simulation approaches for analyzing reliability, survivability, and performance of these critical systems during catastrophic events will be developed. These tools will allow probabilistic prediction of the performance of these systems during natural catastrophes; efficient allocation of critical resources for improving survivability; developing techniques for failure localization; and fast recovery and system restoration.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit:<br/><br/>This project will significantly advance the state of the art by developing analytical and probabilistic models of the performance of realistic interdependent power and communications systems.

Moreover, these influences may change over time (for example, college graduates may earn more compared to high school graduates today than they did in the 1970's). This project develops quantitative methods for using existing databases to reliably assess the impact of observed characteristics on events that are important in public and private policymaking as well as applied scientific research. <br/><br/>The project extends recent advances in the fields of econometrics, statistics and computer science leading to assessments of the influence of observed characteristics on outcomes of interest that are more reliable and practical than has heretofore been possible. The project has three main components. First, it establishes new results in econometrics on the approximation of conditional distributions under weak conditions, using a sequence of models demonstrated to be practical and reliable in the recent research of the investigator, the smoothly mixing regression models of the title. Second, it addresses a series of practical issues in order to enhance the utility of these models, including the use of parallel computing environments to handle large data sets that are increasingly common in economics, the evaluation of competing models, and application of these procedures when several outcomes are simultaneously of interest. Third, it applies these developments in two leading contexts: the aforementioned example involving the influence of individual characteristics on earnings, using the Current Population Survey of the U.S. Census, and measuring the risk associated with investment in financial assets. <br/><br/>Broader impacts: One of the major themes in econometrics and statistics is the development of general methods that do not require restrictive assumptions yet give precise estimates and are computationally feasible. This project builds on the many past contributions by the investigator on this theme and should lead to a major advance in computationally feasible yet flexible methods. These methods will benefit research in a wide range of disciplines including economics, statistics, public health, biostatistics and environmental sciences. The project addresses questions that arise regularly in the Federal statistical system. The investigator rapidly disseminates and applies research findings and regularly interacts with a diverse group of students from academia, government and the private sector through intensive one-week courses taught in various locations.

The central underlying hypothesis is that invasion by fungal colonists often involves antibiosis toward the host, and therefore, such colonists may be valuable, underexplored sources of natural antifungal agents. Thus far, over 2,300 cultures have been isolated from over 600 specimens of stromata and polypores collected from northern forested habitats (Illinois/Wisconsin), subtropical latitudes (Georgia/Florida), and diverse microclimates found on the island of Hawaii. These collections contain considerable biodiversity, and include representatives of many new or relatively unexplored taxa, as well as known mycoparasitic species. Chemical studies will focus on as-yet unexplored active leads from the Hawaiian collection. A second objective follows from the discovery that isolates of the widespread corn endophyte Acremonium zeae commonly produce a set of intriguing natural products (pyrrocidines). These findings have led to the initiation of exploration of a collection of ca. 200 corn endophyte isolates, representing a variety of taxa, in search of other new fungal metabolites that show antagonistic effects against fungal competitors.<br/><br/>With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is renewing support for the work of Professor James B. Gloer, of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Iowa. With his collaborators, Patrick F. Dowd and Donald T. Wicklow, of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Professor Gloer is isolating new organic compounds from fungi, with these studies guided by a hypothesis that parasitic fungi may be rich sources of new chemical structures given their need to develop chemical control over their hosts. Many new bioactive natural products have been discovered through studies of fungal cultures. This unique, growing body of work will ultimately enable efforts to correlate host, geography, and climate with biological and chemical diversity. The resulting data could prove useful in guiding future selection of sources. Antifungal agents are of potential practical value to society in agriculture and medicine, and can also be valuable as tools to assist in discovery of new modes of action. Findings from this project are also expected to contribute to fundamental scientific knowledge in other disciplines, including fungal ecology, taxonomy, biodiversity, crop/food science, and evolutionary biology.

The display pixels detect the presence of the magnetic pen through a change in driving current, thereby locating the position of the pen. This will in turn lead to the desired display response.<br/><br/>Intellectual merit: Recent years have seen a surge in interest in magnetoelectronic effects in organic semiconductors, spurred in part by the discovery of the organic magnetoresistance (OMAR). This effect is highly interesting from the scientific point of view since common knowledge has been that large magnetoresistance can only occur in ferromagnetic materials. Our research will therefore lead to a deeper understanding of charge and spin transport processes in organics and magnetoresistance in general.<br/><br/>Broader impact: Pen-input is expected to surpass keyboard or mouse-based data entry in the near future. Our technology has the advantage that the display and touch sensors are one and the same, whereas in other technologies the touch sensitive system is an expensive add-on. We have initiated a new conference series (Spins in Organic Semiconductors, SPINOR) to facilitate interdisciplinary discussion and put special emphasis on underrepresented minority participation. The combination of scientific investigation and product engineering will ensure a well-rounded education for the students.<br/>
0706108	Collaborative Research: Penalized Methods for Variable Selection and Estimation in High-Dimensional Models	DMS	STATISTICS	08/15/2007	08/03/2007	Jian Huang	IA	University of Iowa	Standard Grant	Gabor J. Szekely	07/31/2008	$45,000.00		jian-huang@uiowa.edu	2 GILMORE HALL	IOWA CITY	IA	522421320	3193352123	MPS	1269	0000, OTHR	$0.00	This project studies penalized methods for variable selection and estimation in high-dimensional models. A general approach for fitting high-dimensional models is to use regularization penalties. Several important penalized methods for variable selection and estimation have been proposed, but the properties of these methods have not been systematically studied. To apply the methods in scientific investigations, it is important to understand their properties. In particular, it is important to know under what conditions, the methods correctly select the important variables and estimate their effects in an efficient way. Standard methods for evaluating a statistical procedure assume that the number of variables in a model is fixed and much smaller than the sample size. This formulation is not applicable to high-dimensional models. The problem of analyzing high-dimensional models presents novel and challenging theoretical questions in mathematical statistics. Current variable selection methods using penalties assume a known form of the statistical model, which can be a misrepresentation of the reality. It is important to investigate what happens if a parametric model is misspecified or if no parametric assumptions are made about the model. In particular, it is important to know whether there are conditions under which penalized methods select variables correctly despite misspecification and under what conditions misspecification causes them to yield misleading results. It is also important to extend the penalized methods to nonparametric and semiparametric models.<br/><br/>High-dimensional data arise in many important applications, notably biological and biomedical investigations. With rapid advances in biotechnology, more and more large data sets are being generated. The identification of statistically and biologically significant patterns from high-dimensional and noisy data sets is a major challenge. The investigators apply the proposed research to genome-wide association (GWA) analysis, detection of copy number variation (CNV), and analysis of censored survival data with gene expression profiles. GWA analysis and detection of CNV enable the identification of genes and pathways responsible for the development and progression of a disease, such as many forms of cancer. Correlating a gene expression profiles with survival is useful, because survival is perhaps the most important clinical endpoint in many cancer studies. The development of statistical methods that can deal with high-dimensional problems in estimating the relationship between clinical outcomes and genetic and genomic data contribute to better understanding of the genetic basis of diseases, better diagnoses, and better survival prediction.<br/><br/>

The key concept of the exhibit is how regional iconic harbingers are related to climate change - for example, the impacts of a changing climate on the maple syrup industry in New England and shifts in bird migration patterns in North Carolina. <br/><br/>Two customizable and modularized versions of an approximately 900 square foot exhibit on local impacts of climate change are being produced for small and medium-sized venues.  The project expects to serve approximately 1.5 million visitors in the two regions and is positioned as an innovative model for other regions of the country.  A citizen science program will be developed by staff at TERC for those participating centers with outdoor venues.  The exhibit is being designed by Jeff Kennedy Associates and MegaFun simulation software designers.  NESCC is also developing a project Web site. Goodman Research Associates is conducting both formative and summative evaluation processes on visitor learning and on the project's collaborative process.  The Association of Science-Technology Centers will manage the two tours.  <br/><br/>

The investigators will conduct a global survey of relevant fossil species, using data from the published literature, existing field collections, new field collections, and museum specimens.  Evolutionary history will be reconstructed using modern quantitative methods.  Hypotheses about relationships will then be applied to a range of important questions in paleobiology, shedding light on subjects such as the nature of mass extinctions, biogeography, and rates of speciation.<br/><br/>Knowledge of evolutionary relationships is a basic requirement for understanding the history of life on Earth, yet modern quantitative methods have not always been applied to the study of fossil animals. The project seeks to redress this by using phylogenetic analysis to consider a diverse and important fossil group; further, this study will potentially serve as a model for the use of fossils to address major evolutionary questions.  The project will train several students in evolutionary systematics, will serve public and K-12 education via a website and traveling museum exhibit, and will also serve the broader discipline by generating new data and also linking these data to existing biological databases.<br/>

The ultimate goal of this research is to understand how enzyme dynamics influence reactivity.  Specifically, they will study three model systems: Dihydrofolate reductase, alcohol dehydrogenase and thymidylate synthase.  Their approach to studying these enzymes is through making specific mutations to the enzyme that subtly change the enzyme structure in known ways and correlating these structural changes with changes in reactivity.<br/><br/>Enzymes are ubiquitous in biology, medicine and commerce.  The ultimate aims of research like that of Prof. Kohen and his group is to gain a mechanistic insight into how biological systems do important chemistries.  This will shed light on the role of evolution in refining bond activation, the role of quantum phenomena (light atom tunneling) in biology, and  will move us towards a better understanding of Global Structure-Dynamics-Function relationships in enzymes, which will have a broad impact in areas of society where the ability to design enzymes to work in useful ways is important.  Besides the broader scientific impacts of this work, Prof. Kohen will continue to recruit, mentor and educate a diverse group of young scientists in science that lies at the interface of the physical and biological sciences.

Consider an adolescent anticipating the consequences of smoking, an entrepreneur anticipating the success of a new business, or a commander anticipating the outcome of a battle.  In these cases, inaccuracies in assessing the future--such as being overoptimistic about a preferred outcome--can have negative or even tragic consequences.  This project investigates the impact people''s preferences regarding an outcome (e.g., hoping a new business will succeed) have on the subjective likelihood of that outcome.  This potential impact is called the desirability bias.  One possible influence of outcome preferences is described by the popularly discussed notion of wishful thinking, which suggests that desire for an outcome can inflate people''s optimism about that outcome.  However, an alternative possibility for the influence of preferences is also quite plausible.  Namely, people might become overly pessimistic about the likelihood of a preferred outcome, perhaps because they want to avoid the extra disappointment or other hardships that occur when a negative outcome is unexpected rather than expected.  This project investigates both the positive and negative sides of the desirability bias.  Broadly stated, this project investigates whether, when, and how outcome preferences cause over-optimism and/or over-pessimism.  <br/><br/>Most previous research investigating desirability biases has focused on people''s discrete outcome predictions about events that are randomly determined.  The experiments in this project focus on non-random outcomes and were designed from an information-processing perspective.  The experiments test possible mechanistic accounts of desirability effects, particularly the enhanced-focalism and confirmation-bias accounts.  Special attention is paid to understanding individual differences in desirability effects.  Not only will the findings help theory development within psychology, but they will also have potential applications for predicting people''s health behavior, investment decisions, and voting behavior.<br/><br/>_________________________________

Thus the neonatal period is the ?critical window? when such development occurs. The fact that it is also the period of highest mortality, indicates that development of this adaptive system: (a) may be suboptimal in some cases and (b) needs further investigation. For certain mammals, perhaps all birds and many lower vertebrates and prochordates, the lymphoid tissues involved at this stage appear to be associated with the hindgut. In pigs, these are called the ileal Peyer's patches (IPP) that are found in various hoofed mammals but not in rodents or humans.  This is a proposal to support or reject the hypothesis that the IPP is crucial for the development of adaptive immunity in neonates. Approaches to testing this hypothesis include assessing the effect of removing the IPP; analyzing the antibody repertoire of IPP from germfree and colonized piglets at different ages; and characterizing the specificity of IgG3 antibodies that are postulated to develop at this stage independent of antigens and with a broad specificity.<br/> The study is a collaboration of investigators at four universities, two countries and one government laboratory. It has a training program component involving undergraduate internships and graduate student exchange.<br/>

The conference is organized jointly by the American Physical Society and the American Association of Physics Teachers.  The conference will take place at the American Center for Physics in College Park, MD in Summer 2007, and will bring together about 100 participants including those in a position to implement changes and those in a position to provide informed recommendations for change.  The conference is motivated partly by the recent report of the APS-AAPT Task Force on Graduate Education in Physics [1], which indicates that present programs and curricula are largely static and that best practices are not readily shared.  Student awareness and preparation for non-academic positions, and in particular industrial positions, must be improved.  Other issues looming large for physics graduate programs that wish to remain healthy and competitive internationally include attention to their graduates' communication skills and ethics education, and to the promotion of diversity in order to attract the necessary talent to physics.  The conference will serve to focus the attention of the physics community on graduate education, so that graduate preparation in physics can continue to remain competitive world-wide.  The conference will also provide an opportunity to find ways that best practices can be identified, adapted, and implemented in a department within its local constraints.  New ideas and directions are expected to emerge, and action plans will be developed within the community to pursue these initiatives.  This award is supported by the Physics Division, the Division of Materials Research, and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities of the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate, as well as the Division of Graduate Education in the Directorate for Education and Human Resources.

Through investigations of selected model reactions, the critical variables for these reactions steps will be identified. Information concerning specific coordination environments, metal and ancillary ligand options, substrate requirements and reaction conditions that favor particular reaction steps will be delineated. Proposed investigations of C-H bond activation by Pt(II)/Pd(II) complexes, of reductive elimination from Pt(IV) complexes, of reactions of Pt and Pd alkyls with molecular oxygen, of the reactivity of five-coordinate Pt(IV) complexes, of olefin insertion and -hydride elimination reactions at Pt(II), all have high intrinsic value in developing fundamental knowledge and establishing the foundations needed to pursue the rational development of effective organometallic catalysts for challenging organic transformations. <br/><br/>The development of effective methodologies for the direct conversion of hydrocarbons to more versatile chemicals and the utilization of oxygen as an oxidant in such processes could fundamentally change practices in the chemical industry with the benefits of lower cost feedstocks and oxidant, lower energy consumption, lower capital costs with fewer reaction steps and product separations, and lower volume and less toxic waste production. In addition, the knowledge gained concerning the use of metals for the selective activation and conversion of C-H bonds into new C-C and C-X bonds and the use of molecular oxygen as an oxidant may provide organic chemists with novel options for application in the production of specialty chemicals and complex molecular syntheses of pharmaceuticals and organic materials. While working on this project, graduate students, postdoctoral associates and undergraduate students will study organometallic reactions and become highly skilled in advanced laboratory techniques and in the use of numerous analytical and spectroscopic methods.  <br/>

Mathematics majors and minors may also study real analysis or abstract algebra. Students often find the transition from taking calculus courses to taking more formal, proof-based mathematics courses particularly challenging, and often a stumbling block to further academic success. Sophomore and junior level courses such as differential equations, linear algebra, geometry, and courses introducing set theory and logic constitute a core collection of courses that have the potential to facilitate this transition. The main goals of this project are to make contributions to theory and methodology in terms of the continuum between informal and formal mathematical reasoning. In particular, the PIs will develop theoretical means for interpreting the transition to formal, proof-based mathematics courses. They do so by using four different perspectives on the nature of the individual and collective growth of knowledge. The methodological products will include strategies for data collection and data analysis that allow for insights into student learning within and between each of the four different theoretical perspectives. The mathematical context for this work will primarily be linear algebra, with insights drawn from our prior work in differential equations, geometry, and set theory.<br/>

We characterize countermeasures addressing attacks on these communication properties. We are working to integrate the solutions created in this work with existing telecommunications and IP networks and communication systems.  In so doing, we provide protection for critical pieces of national communications infrastructure while allowing users to receive the full benefits from interconnected voice and data systems.<br/><br/>We are producing: 1) realistic threat and adversary models, 2) a taxonomy of vulnerabilities in current and next generation cellular networks, 3) techniques to identify and characterize vulnerabilities in these systems, 4) domain specific and general detection and mitigation strategies and their inherent tradeoffs and 5) solutions integrated the into current telecommunications infrastructure, public networks and end devices.<br/><br/>The work allows telecommunications networks to continue to provide for critical communication in times of normal and emergency use while enabling increased connectivity to third party data networks such as the Internet.

OVLS deposition combines aspects of vapor-phase deposition with solution-phase growth using a liquid or liquid crystalline matrix, offering several important advantages compared to conventional physical vapor deposition (PVD) techniques. They include the ability to perform deposition at atmospheric pressure with the substrate near ambient temperature, crystallites much larger in size than PVD films, compatibility with a wide range of molecular building blocks and vapor generation methods, as well as the ability to exert greater control over growth habit, film morphology, and crystallographic orientation. The research will train a total of six to nine undergraduates and one to two high school students.<br/><br/>%%%<br/><br/>Over the last ten years a new and very promising technology has begun to emerge which aims to replace the silicon used in conventional electronics with organic molecules. Sometimes referred to as plastic electronics, this technology may eventually be used to produce extremely low cost, light weight and mechanically flexible electronic devices such as wallpaper or fabrics that can display color images, roof tiles to collect solar energy, and credit cards that can retain and secure information. However plastic electronics must overcome several technical hurdles before having widespread commercial impact. One of these concerns the quality of the thin films of molecules used to conduct electricity. Using current approaches, these films have numerous flaws which can only be eliminated using very expensive fabrication methods. This research will investigate a new approach to preparing films for plastic electronics that may result in significantly improved performance, while lowering the cost of production. The research will be carried out primarily by undergraduate students in a collaboration involving chemists and physicists.<br/>

Daniel Crawford of Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University is supported by the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to develop methods to provide accurate predition of the optical properties of large chiral molecules.  The methods are based on a gauge- and origin-invariant reformulation of coupled cluster theory.  This approach is systematically testable and convergent.  A reduced-scaling implementation of this method is under development that will allow calculations of molecules with up to several dozen atoms.  Applications include calculations of optical rotation and circular dichroism spectra, and direct comparison with experiment. This work is having a broader impact in that the methods developed in this work are freely available through the PSI3 program suite.  Success in implementing the proposed methods will provide valuable insight in assigning absolute stereochemistry of natural products.  Educational efforts include training the next generation of scientists in a set of skills related to computational science.  The educational laboratory program is being expanded to include computational laboratory experiments at the undergraduate level.

The Bakker group will develop a number of methods that use surfactants and polymers as templates into which metals are electrodeposited to give high surface area meso- and micro-porous metal phases on macroporous metal scaffolds. One goal of this research is to understand the various chemical and mass transport factors that dictate the growth of deposited metal structures at a number of length scales (nanometer to micrometer); this understanding will facilitate the maximization of surface area as well as optimization of nano- and micro-scale topography for different applications. Characterization of these materials will be done at the University of Alabama, and also the micro-X-ray fluorescence facility at Los Alamos National Laboratory. The second goal of this research is to evaluate these porous metal materials as electrode/stationary phases in electromodulated liquid chromatography. In electromodulated chromatography, separation of solutes is strongly influenced by the voltage applied to the stationary phase. The materials prepared in this program will be incorporated into columns and evaluated for separations performance as well as chemical and physical stability. The potential for electromodulated size exclusion chromatography will also be explored, with particular focus on the interplay of solute analyte size and geometry, and the nano- and micro-structure of the porous metal stationary phase. <br/><br/>The templating methods and porous electrodes that will be developed in this work will have applicability beyond separations science, in areas ranging from supercapacitors and advanced batteries to environmental remediation.  The project will support both graduate and undergraduate students who will receive a well rounded research experience in chemistry and materials science. <br/><br/><br/>

The University of Alaska, Fairbanks (UAF) proposal is in response to the National Science Foundation Program Solicitation NSF 07-515 for the management, acquisition and operation of an Alaska Region Research Vessel (ARRV). The construction of an ARRV was given the highest priority in the report ?National Academic Research Fleet ? a Long Range Plan for Renewal?.   The proposed design was developed with input from the oceanographic science community and the academic fleet operators.  The design was completed in December 2004 and is well suited for oceanographic and fisheries research in the harsh, ice-infested Alaska seas during all seasons.  <br/><br/>UAF proposes to assemble a management team for the acquisition of the ship that draws on extensive experience for public agency ship procurements.  They propose to use experienced personnel and vessel acquisition procedures that have proven successful in Alaska Marine Highways (AMS) recent vessel acquisitions.   UAF will be using the Earned Value Management (EVM) and Project Execution Plan (PEP) systems used by AMS during these acquisitions.  The University is contracting with two experience marine science technical engineers to insure the ship science capabilities are not compromised. <br/><br/>The proposal was reviewed by 10 mail reviewers and 10 panelists.  A major recommendation from the panel was a phased acquisition strategy to mitigate risk.   A four phase approach is proposed with given milestones to be completed prior to funding of the next phase.  This CSA provides the funds for Phase I and completion of related milestones including the design refresh and cost update, project execution plan, development of an oversight committee, draft shipyard contract and completing the formation of the project management team.

This objective is based on the effectiveness of BPs in preventing bone-loss, and as an alternative to the oral-administration of BPs to avoid side-effects while acting much more quickly. The proposed work builds upon the biomimetic coating of Ti foams with BP-loaded CDHA as it helps bone-loss treatments in a dual manner by increasing the bone-building osteoblasts and by causing apoptosis of bone-resorbing osteoclasts.  This research will address the following objectives: (1) use the parameters obtained from the investigators previous research to produce crack-free BP-loaded coated flat substrates, (2) determine the chemical characteristics of the as-coated BP-loaded substrates, (3) based on the results, coat reticulated Ti foams, and (4) perform in vitro tests to examine both osteoclast and osteoblast response of the BP loaded substrates and foams. <br/><br/>The local and selective delivery of drugs is seen as part of the future of medical treatments.

The metal-organic systems include lithium, aluminum, scandium, and copper complexes of DNA and RNA nucleobases, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and polyphenyls. These complexes are prepared in laser-vaporization molecular beams, identified with photoionization mass spectrometry, and studied using ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR)-UV pulsed field ionization-zero electron kinetic energy (ZEKE) photoelectron and photoionization spectroscopy. The UV ZEKE experiments measure precise ionization energies and low frequency metal-ligand stretches and bends, whereas the IR-UV ZEKE and photoionization experiments determine the high-frequency ligand vibrational modes of these systems. The ionization energy is one of the key thermochemical properties of a molecule and is used to obtain the metal-ligand neutral bond energy by combining the ionization energy of the metal atom and the bond energy of the cation. The metal-ligand stretches and bends give direct evidence about the metal-ligand binding, whereas the high-frequency ligand vibrations probe changes in the ligand geometry induced by metal coordination. Combining the spectroscopic data and theoretical predictions determines electronic states and molecular structures.  <br/><br/>This research project will lead to new knowledge about the structure and energetics of complexes made up of metal atoms binding to molecules.  The results will be of interest to practitioners in organometallic chemistry, biochemistry, catalysis, and materials synthesis. This project provides technologically challenging research training opportunities for students and postdoctoral associates to prepare them effectively for future employment.<br/><br/>

Box 1881	Milwaukee	WI	532011881	4142887200	MPS	1962	0000, OTHR	$0.00	Scott Reid of Marquette University is supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to carry out experiments that aim to answer key questions concerning the electronic structure and photochemistry of carbenes and carbocations.  These species are important reactive intermediates, implicated in many organic and organometallic reactions, in combustion and the thermal decomposition of small organic molecules, and in stratospheric and interstellar chemistry.  First, plans are to apply high resolution, state-selected double resonance techniques to obtain detailed information on the triplet state structure, spin-orbit mixing, and singlet-triplet gaps in a number of significant carbene species.  A second phase will involve the examination of photophysics and photochemistry of simple halocarbenes.  Preliminary studies have shown that these molecules can exhibit unusual photochemistry, which at present is not well understood.  These studies will seek to characterize specific halocarbene photochemistry and provide new information on higher excited states that will serve as benchmarks for ab initio theory. A third phase will examine carbocations, which have long resisted gas-phase structural analysis despite their chemical importance.  Following the Reid group''s recent observation of the first gas-phase electronic spectrum of a halocarbocation, the spectroscopy and dynamics of a series of halocarbocations will be studied using sensitive, high-resolution spectroscopic techniques.<br/><br/>Outcomes from this research are expected to advance knowledge in areas of chemistry and environmental science, and serve as benchmarks for theoretical chemistry calculations.  The projects will provide training for graduate and undergraduate students in a variety of important skill areas. Group members will play an active role in disseminating research results via journal publications and presentations at conferences.

While most localities prepare a disaster plan and invest in local emergency management to respond after disasters, individual households are far less prepared, and preparedness rates are particularly low for racial/ethnic minority households.  The traditional modes of risk and preparedness communication have failed to reach or motivate residents to prepare for disasters.  The community website is a potentially powerful tool to increase hazard preparedness.  However, there is virtually no research on the development of local governments. web sites for hazard preparation or the usability of this information technology by community residents.   <br/> <br/>This research will investigate the use of the World Wide Web by local governments and residents for delivering and receiving risk and preparedness information. Study areas will be communities in the Los Angeles and Miami; both areas are subject to natural disasters, earthquakes in the Los Angeles area and<br/>hurricanes in the Miami region.  Using multiple data collection methods and sources of data, the research will examine the local government decision-making process for website development for risk communication and hazard preparedness; usability of local government websites for hazard-related information; and the potential impact of risk communication and disaster preparedness Web pages in motivating residents to take proactive measures. Website evaluation data and resident survey data will be combined with secondary sources for<br/>multivariate statistical analysis.  Eight jurisdictions will be selected for case studies.  Interviews with local government professional staff and officials will be conducted and these data, along with background materials, will be analyzed qualitatively.     <br/> <br/>The results ofthis research will provide a unique contribution to the E-government and hazards literature of significant intellectual merit.  The study brings together information technology, government, and citizens around a critical community issue: preparing for disasters.  It will contribute significantly to our understanding of local government use of the web in general as well as for hazards; provide valuable information to policy makers and professionals about the use, coverage, and design of local government home pages; and examine the public decision-making process surrounding technology, community safety, and service to citizens.  <br/> <br/>The research also will have broader impacts to education and society as a whole.  The results of the research will provide valuable information to policymakers about risk communication via the web, and about impediments to use of their communities' websites for disaster preparedness. This knowledge can be used to remove barriers, improve hazard communication to racial/ethnic minorities, motivate increased disaster planning by citizens, and thus, promises to contribute to a reduction in human and property losses from disasters.

This program will elucidate the fundamentals that can enable the efficient utilization of catalytic microcombustion for diverse end use applications, such as heat sources for warmth, coupled combustor/reactor to drive endothermic reactions.  One use would be producing controlled amounts of chemicals on demand, while another would be to produce hydrogen for proton-exchange-membrane (PEM) fuel cells. This will be achieved by the integration of hierarchical multiscale simulation with experiments in tunable, high-surface-area catalytic microburners without movable parts.<br/><br/>This program could lead to technology that would eliminate the environmental burden of dealing with acid-based batteries and the logistics of recycling or using partially used batteries and recharging as well as bypass the thermal NOx production of combustion processes. Furthermore, the understanding gained from this work could assist in the commercialization of short contact time catalytic reactor technology transforming larger alkanes or biomass-based chemicals to olefins, which are key starting chemicals in the polymer industry. As part of this project, surface reaction mechanisms in Chemkin format and a tutorial on thermodynamic consistency of catalytic reactions will be disseminated via the web.<br/><br/>

Most of the techniques known to date that analyze root secretions depend upon the destructive organic analysis of samples. In the past, these classical techniques that include colorimetric and chromatography have helped scientists to identify various exuded metabolites. However, none of these techniques are useful for monitoring secretions in real-time. Developing a technology to examine in situ-based non-invasive methods for analyzing real-time root secretions is a current goal of the scientific community. A non-invasive real time method to monitor root secretions will help to understand and elucidate various unknown novel chemical interactions between plant roots with other roots, microbes and nematodes. The purpose of this research is to explore Arabidopsis thaliana root secretions in situ using a novel technique known as Raman Chemical Imaging Microscopy (RCIM). RCIM allows rapid and non-destructive real-time analysis of nearly all secondary metabolites (no mass cut-off) based on their polarizability, without involving organic extraction and chromatographic separations. This project will investigate the following specific objectives: (1) to conduct a study of total root secretions in real-time from A. thaliana roots in response to abiotic and biotic stresses, (2) to utilize different secretion pump inhibitors to validate the results of Aim 1, and assort metabolites to the respective secretion pumps. The results obtained from this exploratory project will highlight RCIM as a powerful tool for answering basic questions in rhizosphere biology. <br/><br/>Broader impacts. <br/>The unique application of RCIM in plant biology research is the observation and analysis in a standoff mode, which will facilitate the identification of secreted metabolites and provide data pertaining to the biological significance of these metabolites in the rhizospheric interactions. The outcome of this project will generate the most extensive collection of secretion profiling in A. thaliana. The methodology that will be developed through this project will be broadly applicable and will offer the ability to identify an unknown function for known secondary metabolites that are secreted and regulated in response to biotic and abiotic cues. The project will contribute to ongoing activities of the PI linking research and education. The career opportunities for a postdoctoral fellow and one undergraduate summer intern involved in the project will be enhanced in the areas of experimental design and technical expertise. <br/>

The coercivity of these magnets is due to the shape anisotropy of fine Fe-Co rods which are produced through a spinoidal decomposition when the bulk sample is subjected to a high temperature heat treatment. The research here will allow us to study the size and shape dependence of spinodal decomposition in Alnico alloys under confined geometry in the form of nanoparticles, nanorods and thin films. PI will then use this information to tailor the properties of these magnets to values approaching those predicted by theoretical models. The aim of this research is to develop magnets with coercivity above 4 kOe. This is a high risk project since nobody so far has succeeded in getting coercivity greater than 2 kOe. This transformative project is also very interesting scientifically since it is focused on the size and shape dependence of spinodal decomposition and will provide valuable information on volumetrically constrained phase transformations. NON-TECHNICAL: The potential pay-off of this high risk undertaking will revolutionize the field of permanent magnets if successful. Coercivity in the range of 4-6 kOe, would allow the development of Alnico magnets with energy products in the range of 30-35 MGOe, comparable to the values of the expensive Sm-Co rare earth magnets. This will have a significant impact in the industry based on their projected lower cost (they do not contain any of the expensive rare earths), better high temperature properties, corrosion resistance and mechanical strength. The ability to nano-engineer permanent magnets from systems of nanoparticles would not only provide the opportunity to test the theoretical models already in the literature but will open the door for lighter and more powerful magnets that would open the door for many new applications. The interdisciplinary nature of the research will establish collaborations with other departments including Materials Science and Chemistry. The PI will use most of this grant to support a graduate student, a part-time undergraduate and one local high school student for the summer. Special emphasis will be given to minority and underrepresented groups. Through the Network of Undergraduate Collaborative Learning Experiences for Underrepresented Scholars (NUCLEUS) program the Magnetics lab participates in a campus wide effort to recruit underrepresented groups to the physical sciences whilst expanding our own horizons.

Graphene represents a monolayer of carbon atoms densely packed into a honeycomb lattice. Although bulk graphene is a zero-gap semiconductor, its quantum wires and dots exhibit charge and spin properties that can be manipulated through the topology of their edges and their size. The approach to the modeling of spin and charge currents in hybrid and all-graphene multiterminal nanostructures is based on the development of novel computational algorithms using the nonequilibrium Green functions, density functional theory, and electron-electron interaction treatment beyond self-consistent mean field when necessary for ultrasmall devices.<br/><br/>Intellectual merit:<br/><br/>The recent discovery of graphene has ushered unforeseen avenues to explore low-dimensional electron system, probe quantum electrodynamics of charged neutrinos in table-top experiments, and build quantum-coherent carbon-based nanoelectronic devices. Unlike carbon nanotubes, which are a rolled up sheets of graphene, the proposed graphene devices will be easy to integrate with standard lithographic techniques. Moreover, their ultrasmall size and reduced power consumption could offer a viable alternative to aging silicon technology, while<br/>making it possible to exploit quantum interference effects in charge and spin transport, even at room temperature.<br/><br/>Broader Impact:<br/><br/>The proposed research will offer excellent training for graduate and undergraduate students in quantum transport and parallel computing techniques. The outreach will include summer schools and creation of visual simulations to teach the exciting physics of relativistic electrons in graphene through computational science courses and on the Web.<br/>
0710210	Materials World Network: Interaction of Time- and Load-History Dependent Degradation of Multilayered Materials Subjected to High Temperatures	DMR	METAL & METALLIC NANOSTRUCTURE, COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH	08/15/2007	07/07/2009	Anette Karlsson	DE	University of Delaware	Continuing grant	Eric Taleff	07/31/2012	$299,000.00		a.karlsson@csuohio.edu	210 Hullihen Hall	Newark	DE	197162553	3028312136	MPS	1771, 7298	5936, 5980, 7488, 9162, AMPP	$0.00	This is an international research collaboration between the University of Delaware (USA), the University of Bochum (Germany), and the German Aerospace Center (DLR, Germany), investigating the high temperature response of material systems with interfaces of dissimilar materials.  Understanding the high temperature response for such systems has important implications on many applications, ranging from high temperature materials such as thermal barrier coatings, to the new generations of electronic components, such as Nano/Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (N/MEMS).  Multi-material systems exhibit time and temperature dependent materials evolution, such as interdiffusion, precipitating and dissolution of phases, along with chemical reactions at elevated temperatures.  In addition to such complex material evolution, most high temperature applications are subjected to both thermal and mechanical cyclic loading.  The interaction between the time-dependent processes and the degradation due to cyclic loads is highly non-linear.  Thus, it is difficult to use common approaches of accelerated testing for lifetime assessment under realistic loading conditions, as well as reproducing realistic load spectra and realistic time scales in a laboratory environment.  This work aims to develop a combined experimental and numerical technique for accelerated testing and life-time prediction of material systems with interfaces of dissimilar materials subjected to high temperatures.  Complementary expertise from the three organizations  provides a unique synergistic research environment, enabling the research goals to be reached.   <br/><br/>A major broader impact of the proposal lies within a significant education component, including involving about five undergraduate students  in particular from underrepresented groups  in the research.  Furthermore, a key part of the project is a transatlantic student exchange, where two graduate students from the University of Delaware spend up to six months each at state-of-the-art research laboratories in Germany.  Reciprocal visits from the German counterparts enhance the international experience. <br/><br/>This award is co-funded with the Office of International Science and Engineering.<br/><br/>
0709197	Flows of Free Liquid Fibers and Sheets	DMS	APPLIED MATHEMATICS	08/15/2007	08/03/2007	Thomas Hagen	TN	University of Memphis	Standard Grant	Henry A. Warchall	07/31/2010	$38,199.00		thagen@memphis.edu	Administration 315	Memphis	TN	381523370	9016782533	MPS	1266	0000, 9150, OTHR	$0.00	This project is concerned with the formation and evolution of free liquid filaments, jets and sheets of viscous, viscoelastic, and viscoplastic fluids under the influence of internal and external forces. The formulation of these fluid flows involves an unknown free surface that describes the region in an ambient medium occupied by the fluid. Understanding how these free surfaces evolve, what flow scenarios and material parameters are prone to trigger flow instabilities, and how the transition to flow catastrophes such as capillary breakup proceeds is a fundamental challenge in mathematics and the sciences.  Capillary, inertial and viscoelastic forces or balances thereof are known to stabilize or destabilize fluid filaments. In the case of highly viscous fluids, liquid filaments thin uniformly before breakup occurs and drops are formed, while in contrast viscoelasticity is expected to induce a beads-on-string morphology of the liquid filaments. The inherently nonlinear nature and the high degree of complexity of the cascade of events leading to thinning, necking, breakup or other transient patterns are topics that this project addresses. It encompasses a rigorous derivation and justification of averaged lower-dimensional equations for thin filaments and sheets indicating boundaries of validity of these models, a discussion of capillary thinning and breakup of viscoplastic fluid jets, and stability studies in the context of fiber spinning and film drawing for viscous and viscoelastic liquids. Analyzing and justifying mathematical models of fiber and film flows and explaining observed flow phenomena arising in capillary thinning and engineering applications requires the development of new mathematical tools, combining machinery from partial differential equations, stability theory, asymptotic analysis and multiscale analysis.<br/> <br/>A variety of high-tech applications, including food processing, ink-jet printing, atomization of paints and aerosols, jet stabilization, fiber spinning, and electrospinning of nanofibers, are all characterized by similar objectives: to either induce breakup of thin fluid filaments (or sheets) in a controlled manner, to suppress it or to keep flow instabilities from occurring. To reach these objectives, a deep mathematical understanding of the physical mechanisms and rheological parameters governing the onset of instabilities and the transition to flow catastrophes is necessary. The investigator develops the mathematical framework to derive, analyze, and justify flow models describing the evolution of free liquid filaments and sheets. Under examination are the occurrence of flow instabilities, the transition to breakup, and novel rheological phenomena in several exemplary flows. This research has the potential to significantly enhance our knowledge of the physical principles and limitations governing flows in these vital areas of engineering and science. The project also serves the purpose to train both graduate and undergraduate students in mathematical fluid mechanics and applied analysis in general and fiber/sheet forming flows in particular.<br/>
0727611	Collaborative Research:  Scaling up from community to meta-ecosystem dynamics in the rocky intertidal - a comparative-experimental approach	OCE	BIOLOGICAL OCEANOGRAPHY	08/15/2007	08/15/2007	Karina Nielsen	CA	Sonoma State University	Standard Grant	David L. Garrison	07/31/2011	$188,511.00		knielsen@sfsu.edu	1801 East Cotati Avenue	Rohnert Park	CA	949283609	7076643972	GEO	1650	9169, EGCH	$0.00	The meta-ecosystem concept hypothesizes that the dynamics of ecological communities reflect interdependence between local-scale and ecosystem processes that vary across large distances. Thus, variation among communities depends not only on locally-varying species interactions and abiotic factors, such as physical disturbance, but also on regionally- and globally-varying ecosystem processes, such as dispersal and flows of materials such as nutrients and carbon. This study of rocky intertidal communities and the factors underlying their variation addresses the issue of meta-ecosystem dynamics. The goal of this project is to understand how variability in oceanographic subsidies, such as nutrients and phytoplankton, influences benthic community structure in the northern California Current Large Marine Ecosystem. Local-scale variation in upwelling along the Oregon and northern California coasts will be used to understand how changes in nutrients and productivity influence benthic-pelagic coupling, its effect on benthic species interactions, and ultimately rocky intertidal community structure. A conceptual model, in which the independent variable is seawater temperature (SWT), is used to predict how the dual effect of nutrients and light on marine benthic and pelagic primary production generates different community outcomes in the low intertidal zone. The two endpoints of community structure are a dominance of filter feeding invertebrates or macroalgae. The model predicts that with low (cold) SWT, nutrient and light availability is high, and macrophytes are dominant. Under very high nutrients and light, competitively dominant kelps will prevail and possibly facilitate stress-intolerant macroalgal species, and as nutrients and light diminish, kelp dominance should switch to dominance by surfgrass and foliose understory algae. With higher (warmer) SWT, conditions favor high phytoplankton production, leading to dominance by sessile invertebrates. High phytoplankton also creates low light and low nutrient conditions, negatively affecting growth of macroalgae and their ability to compete with sessile invertebrates. Research will be conducted at 15 sites nested within five capes spanning the 1300 km range of the study region. A water sampling program will quantify concentrations of nutrients and phytoplankton, field-deployed remote sensors will provide time-series estimates of light and chlorophyll a, and surveys will quantify community structure. Manipulative field experiments will test the role of species interactions on community structure and how interactions vary with ecological subsidies.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: Three of the PIs (Hacker, Menge, Nielsen) have undergraduate and graduate teaching responsibilities, which involve instruction and training in marine ecology. Each makes a major effort to foster the participation of underrepresented groups in lab and field activities; Menge, Hacker and Nielsen''''s lab groups consist mostly or entirely of women. Nielsen''''s position at Somona State University (SSU), a four-year undergraduate institution with few funded research programs, offers a rare chance for SSU undergraduates to participate in a first-rate research experience. Finally, the work will provide insight into the consequences of predicted changes in upwelling regimes due to human activity and climate change, thereby giving the research societal significance. Knowledge of the importance of benthic-pelagic coupling to the dynamics of rocky intertidal communities is crucial to manage and conserve marine communities facing human-induced variation in climate. The PIs will work with a policy and outreach program to communicate the research beyond academic circles to the wider public and stakeholders.

To achieve better performance, we adopt an HSN model consisting of a small number of powerful high-end sensors (H-sensors) and a large number of low-end sensors (L-sensors). The objective of this project is to investigate innovative network architectures of HSNs, and develop energy-efficient, self-healing schemes and routing protocols for HSNs. We plan to build an integrated research and education program. The research components of the project consist of the following two parts: <br/>. Investigating efficient and robust network architectures of HSNs.<br/>We will investigate innovative network architectures for two different types of HSNs: HSNs where the locations of H-sensors are controllable and NOT controllable. We will determine the optimal density of H-sensors and L-sensors, and the optimal locations of H-sensors to minimize the cost of sensor nodes while ensuring a network lifetime and coverage requirement. We propose a novel Density-Varying-Deployment scheme for H-sensors. We will also design robust clustering schemes that can tolerate H-sensor failures and provide reliable network structures.<br/>. Designing self-healing and energy-efficient schemes and routing protocols for HSNs.<br/>The primary functionality of wireless sensor networks is to sense the environment and transmit the acquired information to a base station for further processing. Thus, routing is an essential operation in sensor networks. Typical sensor nodes are small, unreliable devices with limited energy supply. The routing protocols should be energy-efficient and robust to sensor failures, and be able to find new paths when nodes fail. By utilizing powerful H-sensors, we will design self-healing, energy-efficient routing protocols for HSNs which take into consideration of data fusion.   <br/>The research is tightly coupled with an educational program that includes the following four themes, <br/>1) Mentoring graduate and undergraduate students, and recruiting students of underrepresented groups in North Dakota and Tennessee to participate in the project. <br/>2) Developing a new graduate course-Wireless Sensor Networks. <br/>3) Field study of sensor networks. Sensor networks have been deployed in several farms in North Dakota for agricultural monitoring and several chemical/nuclear plants in Tennessee for hazard monitoring. We will take students to the farms and plants to study how to improve the performance of these real sensor networks by applying our research results. <br/>4) Integrating research and education together by setting up a Heterogeneous Sensor Network Lab.  <br/>The Intellectual Merits include:<br/>1) In this research, we will develop innovative network architectures for two different kinds of HSNs, i.e., the locations of H-sensors are controllable or not. <br/>2) We will design energy-efficient and self-healing routing protocols for HSNs, which are robust to node failures and prolong network lifetime. <br/>The Broader Impacts are:<br/>Recruiting students of underrepresented groups, including female, low incoming, first generation, Native American, and African American students in North Dakota <br/>

Synthetic methods that are applicable to substrates adorned with numerous stereocenters and functional groups are extremely valuable to researchers engaged in the synthesis of complex organic molecules.  One way to ensure that new methodology is compatible with challenging substrates is to incorporate the reaction development studies into the total synthesis of a natural product.  Accordingly, three novel radical cyclizations, each of which creates two stereocenters, will be investigated in the course of synthesizing the alkaloids acutumine, lyconadin A, and hirsutellones A/D.  A radical?polar crossover reaction consisting of an intramolecular aryl radical conjugate addition followed by enolate formation and hydroxylation will be explored during the acutumine synthesis.  The centerpiece of the lyconadin A synthesis is a tandem process featuring a 7-exo acyl radical cyclization.  The synthesis of the hirsutellones will be used as an arena for developing a 12-endo acyl radical macrocyclization.  Radical cyclizations have been selected for study because the mild reaction conditions and potential for cascade transformations render them attractive to synthetic chemists.<br/><br/>With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Professor Steven L. Castle of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Brigham Young University.  Professor Castle's research efforts revolve around the development of new radical cyclizations.  This chemistry employs mild reaction conditions, which allow for compatibility with many sensitive functional groups that are present in organic molecules.

For applications that involve tracking movements at large scale such as tracking of thieves and robbers fleeing with stolen objects, tracking of animals in forests, and tracking the spread of forest fire, using the full coverage model makes sensor deployment prohibitively expensive. No sound model currently exists that can be used for systematic deployment of such large scale applications.<br/><br/>This project proposes a novel model of coverage called Trap Coverage that can be used for systematic deployment of sparse sensor networks, while ensuring frequent tracking of movements of interest. Most existing theoretical and systems work are not applicable to this new model because of the inherent sparsity of the network implied by the trap coverage model. The overall goal of this project is to establish a strong foundation for all large scale movement tracking applications and address the key systems issues faced in such applications. The project applies rigorous mathematical analysis, experimentation on a large scale sensor network testbed, and real-life deployment of a campus-wide object tracking system called AutoWitness to design, develop, and evaluate the algorithms and protocols developed in this project. In addition to providing hands-on research experience to undergraduate and graduate students in building a real wireless sensor network, the AutoWitness system is expected to help reduce property thefts in a university campus.<br/>

In opposition to this, the past half-century has seen a resurgence of continuous and dynamical approaches to the mind, arguing for a smooth transition from cognitive into motor subsystems. This predicts that the dynamic characteristics of observable action will directly reflect underlying thought processes. In support of this, much recent research has shown that continuous tracking of motor movement can provide rich information about the mental processing giving rise to it.<br/><br/>With support of the National Science Foundation, Drs. Rick Dale and Michael Spivey will explore how action dynamics can shed light on human learning. By tracking computer-mouse trajectories, Dale and Spivey aim to uncover how action dynamics evolve as people learn. Several multi-choice, computer-based experiments will employ tasks of varying complexity, from simple associative learning (e.g., pairing symbols) to acquiring knowledge from text. Such measures would supplement traditional performance variables based on discrete answers. These studies can also provide a further understanding of the intimate connection between thought and action. In addition, the work can provide insights about how best to adapt computer systems for education: Through automatic analysis of computer-mouse movements, these adapted systems could detect such states as lack of learner confidence or deep understanding, and could appropriately respond to these potential deficits in real time, and thereby enhance learning.<br/>

Software engineering for cyber-physical systems;<br/>. Sensor Network development tools and programming abstractions;<br/>. Low-level communication challenges;<br/>. Embedded and real-time computing; and<br/>. Data mining of the physical world (to identify anomalous or interesting patterns in streams of real-time data).<br/>Cyber-physical systems enhance our interaction with the external environment in a similar fashion to the way the Internet changed how we communicate. Hence cyber-physical computing represents an era in computing where logical processing is more tightly intertwined with the external physical world. These systems offer a myriad of new challenges that stem from combining processing, communication, and physical interaction with the external world. Promoting practical cyber-physical computing research entails adequate experimental testbeds that allow evaluation, validation, and fine tuning of different ideas. The fine-granularity instrumentation required serves as a unifying theme across various studies. Sensor network technology is expected to economically address this need once key sensor network research impediments are resolved. This research facility is likely to be unique in the nation in its scale.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: This work creates opportunities for interdisciplinary research where problems are solved utilizing CS/CE technology in the context of real applications drawn from environmental and atmospheric science, biology, anthropology, geology, agriculture, etc. The facility enables, among others,  studies of infectious disease propagation, climate change, deforestation, and global warming. Additionally, the infrastructure offers active learning educational opportunities.<br/>

Humes	08/31/2009	$12,000.00		sambanis@sas.upenn.edu	Office of Sponsored Projects	New Haven	CT	065208327	2037854689	SBE	1371	9179, SMET	$0.00	           What leads armed groups to continue fighting, even in the face of extensive attempts at negotiated settlements or imposed military solutions? The rich information available on the activities of armed groups contrasts with few systematic explanations of this behavior. Systematic models, in turn, often fail to account for the environment in which armed groups operate. This project proposes a new theory of civil war duration and termination that combines the systematic with in-depth knowledge of conflict. How actors benefit from opportunities that exist only during conflict explains duration and termination of conflict. During wartime, actors exploit opportunities unavailable to them under conditions of peace. Wars continue when, conditional on survival, actors remain able to exploit these unique opportunities. The theory suggests that policy-makers concentrate resources on activities that choke off the collateral benefits to conflict. The policy implications of this theory diverge from the predictions of the credible commitment view of war termination prevalent in the literature and policy circles.  <br/>The theory of wartime opportunities will be investigated through field research on the Lebanese Civil War (1975-1990) using parallel qualitative and quantitative strategies: interviews with ex-combatants and civilians and compilation of a disaggregated database on the conflict.  The multiple dimensions of warfare and political issues at play in Lebanon allow the project to examine in one conflict what researchers would have to explore in many separate conflicts.  The research design also explicitly generalizes findings from the fieldwork by placing the Lebanese Civil War in context using cross-national data and other national studies and by an analysis of the conflict in Northern Ireland. This work fits into a larger research agenda that aims to generate and test a better theory of the dynamics of civil wars that can explain outcomes during conflict and their effects on the post-conflict situation.<br/>                        Current explanations of civil war termination in the literature are likely incorrect because of their heavy reliance on the assumption that an inability to credibly commit to a future settlement drives actors to continue fighting.  By proposing an original theory of war termination which does not rely on credible commitment, this project changes how scholars in International Relations and Comparative Politics understand civil wars. The rigorous empirical test of the theory through fieldwork and comparative analysis will advance the field of study.  The project's policy implications will also contribute to policy debates on civil war termination and post-conflict stability.<br/>                         The project's fieldwork involves substantial partnership with the academic community in Lebanon. Lebanese graduate and undergraduate students will be hired as research assistants (RAs) for the database and interview portions of the fieldwork. RAs will be trained and work closely with the co-principal investigator, integrating education and research. Publication of the project's results in Arabic will help to disseminate the findings and extend the research's impact beyond academic circles in the United States and Lebanon to Lebanese society, as will workshops and presentations in Lebanon in addition the U.S. The project's emphasis on the policy implications will provide substantial benefits to society. The goal is to improve the ability of policy-makers to limit the devastating effects of internal warfare and build post-conflict stability.<br/>

The University of Alaska, Fairbanks (UAF) proposal is in response to the National Science Foundation Program Solicitation NSF 07-515 for the management, acquisition and operation of an Alaska Region Research Vessel (ARRV). The construction of an ARRV was given the highest priority in the report ?National Academic Research Fleet ? a Long Range Plan for Renewal?.   The proposed design was developed with input from the oceanographic science community and the academic fleet operators.  The design was completed in December 2004 and is well suited for oceanographic and fisheries research in the harsh, ice-infested Alaska seas during all seasons.  <br/><br/>UAF proposes to assemble a management team for the acquisition of the ship that draws on extensive experience for public agency ship procurements.  They propose to use experienced personnel and vessel acquisition procedures that have proven successful in Alaska Marine Highways (AMS) recent vessel acquisitions.   UAF will be using the Earned Value Management (EVM) and Project Execution Plan (PEP) systems used by AMS during these acquisitions.  The University is contracting with two experience marine science technical engineers to insure the ship science capabilities are not compromised. <br/><br/>In any large shipyard project there are several areas of risk; delays in delivery of critical materials and equipment, such as steel plate or the propulsion system; lack of change order control; untimely or delays in regulatory inspections; lack of fiscal responsibility and/or lack of a realistic contingency or de-scouping plan.  To aid in controlling these risks NSF has developed a tight cooperative agreement with stringent reporting requirements.  In addition, NSF required an oversight committee be established composed of an outside naval architect, two Marine Superintendents with shipyard construction experience, two marine technical engineers (not part of the UAF project team), three oceanographic scientist with experience in the Arctic and sub-Arctic, one fisheries oceanographer and one Alaskan Native.  Monthly meetings with the oversight committee will be required.<br/><br/>The proposal was reviewed by 10 mail reviewers and 10 panelists.  A major recommendation from the panel was a phased acquisition strategy to mitigate risk.   A four phase approach is proposed with given milestones to be completed prior to funding of the next phase.  The CA provides for the Phased approach and outlines milestones for each Phase.  Phase I includes the completion of the PEP, design refresh and cost update, project execution plan, development of an oversight committee, draft shipyard contract and completing the formation of the project management team.  Phase II milestones include completion of shipyard RFP and Technical specifications, Proposal evaluation, contract award and Baseline Review.  Phase III is the construction of the vessel including regulatory and Classification certificates.  Phase IV includes the science test cruises in open and ice-covered waters and the warranty period.  The proposed in-service science date is 2011.       <br/>

Unlike aggregation that concentrates cells, swarming disperses cells across a surface. As a result of evolution the use of energy is optimized by the swarm in order for it to expand and cover the largest possible area, allowing individual cells maximal access to nutrient and oxygen. Despite years of experiments the main problem of swarm dynamics is wide open: how is this optimal cell arrangement produced by individual cells with only local knowledge of their surroundings?  The research group will use a large amount of available reliable experimental data on cell behavior and interactions between cells as building blocks for developing comprehensive mathematical and computational multi-dimensional hybrid models of bacterial swarming based on short and long range interactions. Better understanding of the collective motion of bacteria will shed light on how bacteria infect human tissues in disease. For example, in Cystic Fibrosis the pathogenic bacterium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa swarms over the surface of the lung, clogging the patient's airways. Proteus, another pathogen, also infects by swarming.<br/><br/>The proposed modeling approach will be demonstrated by studying swarming of Myxococcus xanthus; which swarms rapidly, has been studied for decades, and whose numerous swarming mutants have been identified and characterized. To bring different scale levels of description together (from thousands to millions of cells), new mathematical techniques and tools will be developed including elements of stochastic analysis, nonlinear analysis and kinetic theory. The essential part of the project will be to connect results of modeling with experimental results and propose new biological experiments. An important component of the project will be the interdisciplinary training of graduate students in biology and mathematics.

Castellano, Department of Chemistry and Center for Photochemical Sciences, Bowling Green State University, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program to address the growing demand for renewable energy sources and to ensure global environmental integrity.  The heart of the work is concerned with converting terrestrial solar photons and water to an environmentally friendly, non-carbon based combustible chemical fuel (hydrogen) using molecular catalysts in conjunction with semiconducting metal oxide nanomaterials.  A molecular level understanding of the chemical steps leading to hydrogen production in nanoscopic systems can then be broadly applied to water splitting reactions, where water is broken down into molecular oxygen (O2) and hydrogen (H2).  This project investigates the hydrogen-producing capabilities of novel inorganic structures, which will be characterized by extensive photophysical and photochemical studies, including excited state electron transfer.  Such extensive laser-based studies are crucial, since the events immediately following light absorption ultimately determine the fate of the excited state chemistry and thus, the photochemical H2 production.  The proposed work will continue to foster the scientific and professional education of undergraduate and graduate students as well as postdoctoral associates and visiting scientists.  It is anticipated that the new scientific insights developed in this project will contribute to the overarching goal of establishing an environmentally sound energy future for the planet.

Consequently, these rivers are often targets of intensive restoration activities based, perhaps erroneously, on concepts developed for mesic (wetter) rivers.  Arid-land systems differ from mesic counterparts in that they experience enormous variability in flows that range from high floods to being nearly dry.  Low flows and river intermittency are common occurrences, and drying events may be important for enhancing species diversity by allowing coexistence of organisms that specialize on high- and low-flow conditions, respectively.  However, actual effects of seasonal variability in discharge, especially low flows, on aquatic communities remain largely unknown.  <br/> To address this gap in knowledge, a field and experimental study will be conducted on the Rio Grande in New Mexico.  Changes biomass and nutrient composition of the algae, invertebrates, and fishes that make up the river?s food web will be tracked.  Macronutrients, such as carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus, will be used as tracers to understand the dynamics of community changes associated with flow variability and drying in natural river environments.  Finally, an experimental study will manipulate key variables that appear to strongly affect species abundance and diversity in drying river environments.  The outcomes of this study will aid development of scientifically defensible restoration policies and establishment of minimum flows in arid-land rivers.  Development of such policies is of paramount economic importance to arid and semi-arid regions worldwide. <br/>

Avoidance of dynamics facilitates computational tractability and an intuitive theory of pathway structure.<br/>(ii) Development  of a modular, two-scale virus assembly model that makes the mathematics transparent and leads to new directions in geometric complexity and algebraic combinatorics.<br/>(iii)Independent biochemical validation of the 2 separate scales of the model, using known data as well as new experiments.<br/><br/><br/>An array of applications in nanoscience and engineering, biosensor and gene therapy follow from effective models of symmetric macromolecular assembly pathways. Such models would additionally help arrest viral self-assembly and hence numerous plant and animal diseases. Opensource software built atop the PI's FRONTIER geometric constraint solving opensource software suite, and benchmark virus data will be developed for prediction and visualization of self-assembly pathways and for rigorous comparisons. The grant will foster a closely interacting, interdisciplinary group of students and will expose  each of them to research in mathematics, structural biology, theoretical computer science, algorithms and software development. Outreach is planned via an interdisciplinary workshop at DIMACS or at IMA and in university press releases.<br/><br/>

Craniofacial variation has important implications for diet, defense, posture, balance, hearing, vision, and the accommodation of the expanding primate brain.  The skull is a complex adaptive structure, and the question naturally arises pertaining to the genetic mechanisms that assemble and coordinate its shape.  This project will determine whether variation in head shape occurs along similar anatomical axes among living monkeys and apes, their fossil ancestors, a pedigree of 800 extant baboons, and in laboratory mice.  Computerized tomography (CT) scans will be acquired from these heads and used to measure variation in three dimensions.  The genes responsible for this variation will be identified using data from baboon and mouse.  Developmental pathways are shared among mammals, so mice provide an important comparative and experimental basis for primate findings.  The manner by which genes structure variation in head shape will be investigated by combined comparative DNA sequence and bioinformatic analysis, and by engineering similar changes in mice to those seen in baboons.  Many genes doubtlessly contribute to structures like the head, and a general challenge to modern evolutionary and developmental genetics generally is to understand whether some genes are repeatedly involved in similar changes in complex traits over the millions of years and different branches of evolution, or whether different genes in the shared developmental pathways are responsible in each instance.<br/><br/>The project will generate a large amount of data which will be posted on a publicly accessible website along with information on analytical approaches and analyses.  The PIs have a strong record of training women and minority students and they will continue this tradition at all levels from undergraduate to postdoctoral.  Human evolutionary studies have a strong public appeal and this project will be exceptionally popular to the public media.  <br/><br/>

New geodetic, geomorphologic, paleoseismic, gravity, and seismic measurements are being combined to: (1) measure Caribbean plate motion near Jamaica to establish the full fault slip budget across the island and Gonave microplate motion relative to the Caribbean and North American plates; (2) establish the locations, slip senses, and long-term slip rates along major active Jamaican faults through a combination of geomorphologic, paleoseismologic, and targeted gravity studies; (3) construct and test forward and inverse models of fault slip rates, to distinguish between proposed models for how slip is transferred between the offset fault strands, and to improve earthquake hazard assessment in this densely populated and earthquake-prone country use constraints from all measurements; (4) combine results with GPS site velocities from Hispaniola to derive a model for Gonave microplate motion that is fully consistent with all the data.<br/><br/>This project should provide a better understanding of earthquake hazard in Jamaica, which has experienced two destructive earthquakes since 1600 and continues to be vulnerable to significant earthquake damage due to seismic energy focusing and liquefaction of unconsolidated alluvium in much of the heavily populated and economically important southern half of the country. The measurements should provide useful information about the earthquake cycle over range of spatial and temporal scales, including the millenial-scale seismic history and potential of the Plantain Garden fault near the capital city of Kingston to the year-to-year budget of interseismic elastic strain that is accumulating in all areas of the island. The research will be done in collaboration with the Jamaican Seismological Network, which is responsible for seismological network operation, seismic research, and earthquake hazard assessment and response.

At the most basic level, these representations and impressions include information about others' roles, status, kinship and affiliative relationships.  Given the ubiquity of these judgments in day-to-day social interaction, it is important to examine the neural underpinnings of the perception of status and solidarity cues in order to better understand how the mind processes this form of social information. The central goal of the proposed work is to investigate the neural structures associated with the perception and representation of status and affiliation. In particular, commonalities and differences with other social perceptual domains will be examined. These domains include: the perception of emotions (e.g., fear vs. anger) and the non-social perceptual domain of facial symmetry. Importantly, the proposed experiments also contrast the processing of status with those of solidarity and affiliation. Five functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies will test specific hypotheses related to the perception and representation of status and solidarity. Three of these studies will examine the perception of dominance and status across sensory modalities.  The remaining two studies will examine perceptions of solidarity relationships involving affiliation. Two additional studies including a behavioral and ERP study will be run to bolster the brain imaging experiments with behavioral and physiological data. Hypotheses regarding the activation of specific brain areas will be examined.

This 3D structure, however, once conformed, is capable of transitions and/or re-arrangements, as required, to enable essential functional interactions.  The consecutive macromolecular interactions that define the life-cycle of viruses during host-cell infection represent excellent examples of the high fidelity of functional utilization of macromolecular structure.  However, despite much research on viral life cycles, there is limited 3D structural information on the facilitating capsid-host interactions, structural capsid transitions, and capsid-genome interactions.  This project will utilize naturally-occurring variants and emerging virulent strains of the Minute Virus of Mice (MVM), a member of the ssDNA Parvoviridae, as a viral model to decipher the structural requirements for successful host-cell receptor recognition, cellular trafficking and capsid maturation triggered by genomic interaction.  This model system is also ideal for studies of virus strains that are similar to one another yet have pronounced differences in their host-range, tissue tropism, and pathogenic outcomes of infection due to minor structural variations or amino-acid differences on their capsid viral proteins which modify required infectious interactions.  These variations often confer altered viral host-cell interactions, including infectious receptor utilization, which is common in emerging viruses.  This project includes a multi-disciplinary approach, utilizing X-ray crystallography, biochemistry, biophysics, and virology, in a collaborative effort among investigators from four different institutions.  Research outcomes will augment the understanding of functional domain utilization for viral infection in general, particularly for non-enveloped viruses that must evolve strategies for traversing the complex cellular milieu en route to and from their sites of replication, and provide further insight into the mechanism(s) of viral adaptations to new hosts, a phenomenon that often gives rise to emerging viral pathogens.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: <br/>The research objectives of this project will be integrated into the educational training of high school, undergraduate and graduate students in the use of a multidisciplinary approach for studies aimed at deciphering structure-function correlations for macromolecular interactions.  Specifically, high school students will be recruited to work on this project during the summer months through the University of Florida Student Science Training Program (SSTP), three undergraduate students are already actively involved in this project, and three of the specific research aims will form the research component of the Ph.D thesis of a graduate student.  Undergraduate and graduate students will also participate in the research studies to be conducted in the collaborating laboratories.  In addition, a specific outreach aim will involve the production of an educational CD-ROM titled Structural biology as a tool for scientific research as part of the University of Florida Excursion in Science Program web based learning tools aimed at K-12 students.  This aim will also include the development of a three day workshop as part of the University of Florida Teachers as Scholars summer program to accompany the CD-ROM that will provide interdisciplinary physics, math, and biology high school teachers with hands-on experience and theoretical knowledge of structural biology that can be integrated into their classroom teaching strategies. <br/>

Anti-inflammatory treatment of human spinal core injury and its<br/>timing must be based on knowledge of the types of cells participating in the inflammatory response, the time after injury when they appear and the nature of their actions. However, inflammatory cascades and relationship with neurogenesis are complicated and consequence of central nervous system injury including spinal cord injury is poorly understood. Invading macrophages and resident microglia cells, the two major cell types that are from monocytic lineage play major role in the inflammatory process. Due to the lack of specific markers, the functional roles of invading macrophages from activated microglia within injured<br/>spinal cord are not largely unknown. We propose to use microarray techniques to investigate expression profiles on microglia and macrophages in different time points and the expression network between inflammation and neurogenesis. New methods are proposed to label defined cell populations in microglia/macrophage deleted mice. New statistical techniques will be developed to address directly the<br/>challenges from our biological studies. These include removing intensity effect of the Affymetrix data, identifying significant genes and determining gene expressions patterns over time, identifying a small group of genes that differentiate invading macrophages from activated microglia in the spinal cord, among others.  They involve the statistical estimation, testing, variable selection, classification and network modeling in high-dimensional feature spaces.  These emerging problems will be confronted via developing new statistical methods to address the challenges associated with high-dimensionality. At the same time, the investigators  also intend to provide fundamental understanding, via asymptotic analysis and simulation studies, to these problems and their associated methodologies.  A distinguished feature of the proposal is the combination the strengths of our expertise in statistics and molecular biology to gain better understanding of molecular<br/>disturbances in spinal cord and central nervous system injury.<br/><br/>The proposal investigates molecular disturbances in spinal cord and central nervous system injury. Our aims include identifying genes that reveal the distinct functional profiles of resident microglia and invading macrophages in spinal cord injury, and selecting the genes that are uniquely altered during specific facets of the neuronal response to inflammation. These approaches can not only help us understand the molecular mechanisms of inflammatory responses in spinal cord injury, but also potentially identify genes to be targeted for therapeutic intervention following spinal core injury. In addition, our developed cutting-edging statistical techniques and bioinformatic tools can be applied to other biological and statistical researches. The project will also integrate research and education by working closely with students and funding them in the form of research assistantships, creating datasets, and developing publicly available computer code (both made available through the web) for each of the main research endeavors funded by this proposal. Various research findings and examples will be simplified and taught in both undergraduate and graduate courses.<br/>In particular, they will be used in supervising undergraduate senior theses and Ph.D. theses. Postdoctoral fellows and underrepresented groups will be trained as a part of our research investigation. The results will be disseminated broadly through presentations at seminars, conferences, professional association meetings, and internet.<br/>

This project has three primary aims. The first extends development of a new method for constructing hierarchical trees from sequence data using maximum likelihood and modal inference. The tree construction is based upon application of either one of these two inference methods to an ancestral mixture model, a model whose parameters describe the population structure at each fixed time point T in the past.  If one estimates this structure over a fine grid of time points T, the relationship between the estimates over time can be graphically described as a hierarchical tree. The second project aim is to enhance the biological realism of the ancestral mixture model to include (a) multi-state characters, (b) advanced models of sequence evolution, and (c) recombination. The extensions are based on using diffusion kernels constructed from continuous time Markov Chains. Empirical Bayes methods are also proposed to be employed to improve overall estimation precision. The third aim is development of a new method for reconstructing haplotype sequences from genotype data without knowing the parental information. The methods and algorithms are based on the ancestral mixture models together with a multi-moment approach that simplifies computation. In addition, the investigators propose to extend the method to long sequences by sliding a window along longer genotype sequences, then using the information from the overlapping estimates to construct longer haplotype estimates.<br/><br/>The current release of the National Center for Biotechnology Information's(NCBI) database dbSNP contains over 11.5 million human single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) records, representing a 10-fold increase over the last 4 years. Analysis of such data has become a focus of much research within bioinformatics and computational biology because it is the SNPs that carry the information that distinguishes the individuals within a species. Encoded in this data is important information about the relationship between the characteristics of an individual and their genetic code. The investigators are developing methods and models for this data that are fundamentally different in approach from the standard techniques currently used in two areas where SNP data is used, coalescent and phylogenetic inference, in which one reconstructs genetic relationships similar to family trees based on the current ancestors only. The broader impacts of this project include the development of methods and models with potential wide ranging uses across broad scientific disciplines, the increased fusion of biological and mathematical innovation, and opportunities for broad interdisciplinary training of diverse students.<br/><br/>

The results should improve estimates of rates and timings of a wide range of Earth system processes by at least an order of magnitude.  Project activities will be coordinated with more than a dozen international partners and will utilize the expertise of the Cretaceous, Jurassic, and Triassic subcommissions of the International Commission on Stratigraphy. The grand team goal is to extend the ATS, now virtually complete for the Cenozoic Era (0 to 65 million years ago), to encompass the past 250 million years. The methods that underpin the Cenozoic ATS will be applied to the Mesozoic. Emphasis will be placed on the goodness of fit of stratigraphic signals to astronomical models, duplication of records from different regions, and high-resolution calibration to geomagnetic polarity signatures and integrated bio- and chemostratigraphy. To aid in the science, a universally accessible signal processing toolbox will be created to modernize and unite leading statistical time series techniques used in cyclostratigraphic research, as well as in many other geoscience fields. Numerical ages from the reconstructed ATS will be inter-calibrated with other dating techniques in conjunction with NSF's EARTHTIME Project. All data and tools will be documented and accessible through multiple NSF public database systems, including GEON, CHRONOS, PaleoStrat, PBDB, and others. This project fulfills an ongoing global community initiative to develop a continuous, astronomical-calibrated, International Geologic Time Scale for the past quarter billion years of Earth history.

Many of these vital infrastructures are geographically extensive; increasing vulnerability to disruption by natural disasters, accidents, and/or sabotage.  Planning for and managing the vulnerability of critical infrastructure to extreme events is a challenging task.  This is particularly true given the uncertainty associated with the timing and severity of these events and the network components involved.  Effective planning therefore is reliant on the ability to rigorously characterize potential disruptions.  This collaborative research project will develop several new approaches for assessing network vulnerability to interdiction, which is broadly defined as the debilitation of network elements due to disaster, accident, or intentional harm.  To support broader analysis of potential interdiction impacts to networked systems, the investigators will develop a general spatial optimization modeling framework for addressing the interdiction of system flow.  They also will refine and further develop the general framework to address a number of practical planning concerns.  Such concerns include additional planning objectives involving attributes of network components, interdiction cost, and system efficiency.  The ultimate aim of modeling interdiction impact is to better inform mitigation and remediation efforts.  A final goal of this research project will be the operationalization of a modeling framework to support system recovery in the event of interdiction.  This research will be rooted in theoretical developments applicable to any networked system, with the analytical framework being designed for cross-cutting use over a broad spectrum of infrastructures.<br/><br/>Understanding, assessing, and managing threats to critical network infrastructures is essential for ensuring the continuity of these complex systems.  To address these needs, this research project will advance work in geographic information science and network modeling to facilitate identification of infrastructure risks and vulnerabilities.  Modeling techniques developed to identify interdiction vulnerabilities will be useful for informing planning efforts and allocating resources for reducing risk in existing network infrastructure through fortification, recovery, and other such strategies.  The most significant implication of this research may be the ability to consider multiple planning goals in the analysis of network vulnerability within a unified interdiction modeling framework.  Such efforts will result in a more robust and realistic description of interdiction risk, enabling a more comprehensive assessment of recovery and fortification options.  The results of this research will be of interest to the scientific community as well as to governmental and private-sector agencies involved in planning for the continuity of critical infrastructures.<br/>

These polymers are not static, but in a constant state of flux, continuously being synthesized, repaired and/or degraded. The degradations of each of these biological polymers are thermodynamically favorable hydrolytic processes. Thus living organisms engage in a Sisyphean struggle to maintain their polymeric structures. Life, as we know it, is possible only because bulk water is an ineffective reactant. A major chemical role of the large number of enzymes that use water to degrade biological molecules is to enhance the reactivity of water in a controlled fashion. Potential chemical mechanisms of water activation, include desolvation, base catalysis and metal ion coordination have been suggested by structural biology and mutagenesis studies, but the contribution of each of these mechanisms remains essentially untested. <br/>Kinetic isotope effects are the experimental measurements that provide the most direct insight into transition state structures. Technical difficulties have previously prevented the determination of kinetic isotope effects on water activation, in this research three methods for studying phosphoester hydrolysis that could be readily adapted to other enzymes, including proteases and lipases will be developed. These three methods rely on different advances that have been made in the realm of mass spectrometry. The first two methods take advantage of the coupling of thermal conversion (pyrolysis) to an isotope ratio mass spectrometer. The third method employs whole molecule mass spectrometry and takes advantage of the capabilities of the new generation of quadrupole-time of flight mass spectrometers to precisely determine the isotopic composition of molecules utilizing tandem mass spectrometry. The kinetic isotope effects will enhance our understanding of the mechanism(s) of enzymatic water activation and may lead to improved design of protein and other biomimetic catalysts.  When the methodology for determining KIEs is well-developed and tested, further collaborations with other enzymologists will be actively sought to use the special capabilities of the GC/TC/IRMS facility.  Analysis of phosphate is relevant not only to enzymology but to a variety of other interdisciplinary areas.  Determination of isotopic composition is important in the study of the environment, climate change and archaeology; in addition to their uses as metabolic tracers and tools in the characterization of chemical reaction mechanisms.  <br/>CWRU has an active biochemistry undergraduate program with ~30 seniors each year engaging in laboratory research projects and participation in summer research programs for women and disadvantaged minorities. This project will increase the awareness of several undergraduates participating in the research in my lab and with collaborators.  These individuals, along with the supported graduate student and post-doctoral associate, will be introduced to the capabilities of modern mass spectrometry and how they may be enhanced by the application of stable isotopes. These opportunities should bring a strong and widely applicable analytical skill set to their scientific careers. <br/>

While the classical hydrodynamic theories have been successful in describing thermal transport in such systems when the particulate size is large, they could become inadequate when the particulate size is reduced to nanometer dimension. Specifically, thermal fluctuation may significantly affect the thermal transport in such systems, and thus the fluctuating hydrodynamics must be adopted. However, incorporating thermal fluctuations into non-isothermal simulations in a thermodynamically self-consistent manner is extremely challenging and very few efficient algorithms are available so far.<br/><br/>The objective of this project is to develop a novel multiscale simulation framework for modeling of fluctuating hydrodynamics with energy conservation. In the proposed framework, the thermal transport at atomistic, mesoscopic and macroscopic scales are modeled by molecular dynamics  (MD), energy-conserving dissipative particle dynamics (eDPD) and classical computational fluid dynamics method, respectively. In such a framework, the mesoscale fluctuations of nanoparticulates and flow field are modeled explicitly in a thermodynamically self-consistent manner. The eDPD model is parameterized by molecular dynamics simulations and can also be linked to classical hydrodynamics simulation via direct coupling. We will investigate how to incorporate atomistic details into the eDPD model to achieve a seamless integration of modeling of thermal transport across disparate length scales. We will also introduce physicochemical interactions directly into the eDPD model for a more realistic description of particulate interactions. The developed codes will be tested by comparing the simulation results against available experimental results for selected systems. Finally, we will explore the modeling of thermal transport in microchannels grafted with polymers.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The proposed multiscale modeling technique will add new arsenal to the modeling of fluctuating hydrodynamics and complex fluids. The proposed technique is efficient as the heavy computational cost associated with meshing a system with moving boundaries is eliminated. The particle nature of the technique also renders the modeling of complex particle shape straightforward. The computational efficiency and flexibility provided by the new modeling framework will thus enable the efficient modeling of a broad class of transport processes in which mesoscale fluctuation is important. This will help to elucidate the effects of mesoscale fluctuations in these processes and will also help to develop macro-models for these transport processes. Study of the heat transfer in channels grafted with polymers will shed light on the interactions between thermal fluctuation, polymer conformation and fluid flow in the channel and lay the foundation for optimizing the heat transfer in such systems.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The project will provide opportunity for a graduate student to work on an interdisciplinary project involving computational physics, complex fluids, and thermal sciences. The novel multiscale framework developed will be documented in peer evaluated professional journals for wide dissemination. Simulation results obtained in this project will be put into pictorial and movie formats and displayed on internet for teaching. The website will be advertised to research/education professionals, undergraduate/graduate student and K-12 students through various formal and informal channels. The graphic description of fundamental concepts, e.g., Brownian motion of particulates, will facilitate the understanding of these concepts and helps to ignite interest of students in pursuing education in STEM discipline. The research results will also be developed into the teaching materials for the undergraduate computational fluid dynamics course at Clemson University.<br/>

This research focuses on understanding the evolution of a frequently occurring pathogen of corn, Ustilago maydis, and will determine how two other fungal microbes residing in corn affect disease by U. maydis. These other fungi do not cause disease and in some cases, are able to protect the corn plant from disease.  The proposed study has three specific aims. 1) Determine how the helpful fungi interact with U. maydis, by determining patterns of gene and secondary metabolite expression of these three fungi. 2) Determine how U. maydis might evolve to get around the defenses of the plant or these helpful fungi. 3) Verify field observations with controlled greenhouse studies. Results of the proposed work will give insight into the evolution of plant pathogens within a realistic ecological context. <br/><br/>The results of the study will enhance our understanding of an important crop pathogen, one that could become more serious as corn is managed for fuel production. In addition, novel biological control methods may be suggested by the results. The proposed work represents a collaborative effort between G. May (fungal biology and molecular evolution) and H. C. Kistler (fungal genomics and molecular biology). Diverse research personnel will be sponsored and research training provided at the undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral levels. Emphasis will be put on recruiting women and men of color and other underrepresented groups in the biological sciences. Living cultures of fungi obtained from this study will be available for government, industry and academic research in biological control of plant disease.

Environmental scientists and policymakers consider biomass burning to be an important source of greenhouse gases and aerosols like nitrous oxide, methane, and carbon dioxide.  Africa dominates the geographical distribution of fire events globally, accounting for about 40 percent of all fires, and the continent is believed to account for 30 percent of all biomass burning emissions worldwide.  Recent changes in land use and land cover related to the expansion of cotton, tree crops, and livestock rising have led to changes in burning regimes, however.  A burning regime refers to the timing, intensity, and frequency of fires.  The most notable change is in the timing of burning, as fires are set earlier in the dry season by herders.  These early fires are less intense due to high moisture levels in plants and soils.  Early fires are not as destructive to vegetation, which results in more trees in the landscape.  Less intense fires also produce fewer gas and aerosol emissions into the atmosphere.  This doctoral dissertation research project will investigate the impacts of biomass burning on global climate change in the light of social, economic, political, and biophysical processes at the local and regional scales in Cote d'Ivoire.  The doctoral candidate will examine trends in savanna burning regimes, analyze the nature and direction of land cover change over the period 1975 to 2008, and assess the Ivorian savanna ecosystems contribution to the global greenhouse gas production.  Field research techniques and remote sensing methods will be used to address the questions raised in this study.  Surveys and interviews with farmers and herders will be conducted to solicit their perceptions of any changes in burning practices and to gain their perspectives and reasons for setting fires at certain times and places.  Vegetation transects and the analysis of satellite images for four years (1975, 1985, 1995, and 2007) will reveal trends in vegetation cover and the spatial and temporal distribution of burning.  Biomass burning experiments will be conducted throughout the burning season to estimate the amount of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrogen oxides and ozone.<br/><br/>This study will contribute to the scientific literature on global climate change by providing a more accurate assessment of the production of key greenhouse gases at the local and regional scales. The investigators will consider burning regimes and differentiated savanna landscapes in the evaluation of greenhouse gas emissions associated with biomass burning in Cote d'Ivoire.  The data will furnish new estimates of the type and amount of biomass burned and gases emitted.  This knowledge will result in the calculation of new coefficients that are commonly used in global climate change models.  By scaling up from the local to the regional scale, this research should help fill an important gap in current global climate change research.  This research will contribute to the fire policy debates in which savanna ecosystems dynamics are not well understood, especially the impacts of fire on vegetation and greenhouse gas emissions.  The study's results will yield badly needed data on greenhouse gas and aerosol emissions in Cote d'Ivoire that can be used to inform Ivorian environmental policies.  As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.  This award is jointly funded by NSF's Office of International Science and Engineering.<br/><br/>

While much work has been conducted on software failure diagnosis, most previous work focuses on off-site diagnosis (i.e. diagnosis at the development site with involvement of programmers) and thereby is insufficient to diagnose production-run software failure at the user site. <br/><br/>To effectively address production-run failures, we propose a novel approach that automatically performs on-site software failure diagnosis right at the moment of a software failure and provide programmers a detailed diagnosis report regarding the occurred failure, including bug type, bug location, likely root cause, fault propagation chain, failure-triggering input, failure-triggering execution environment, potential temporal fixes, etc, without violating user?s privacy concerns or imposing large overhead during normal execution. To achieve the ambitious goal, the proposed research tightly integrates innovations from multiple layers: (1) Low-overhead operating and run-time system support to capture the failure moment without imposing large overhead during normal execution. (2) A novel, extensible, customizable, human-like failure diagnosis protocol. (3) Novel program analysis techniques that are specifically designed for on-site failure diagnosis. (4) Leverage existing and emerging hardware support and simple hardware extensions to reduce overhead.(5) A library-based API to allow applications to control or customize the diagnosis process if necessary.

Users have very diverse computer equipment ranging from handheld devices to desktops, and downloaded items range from simple stock quotes to news stories to full movies. Such highly heterogeneous circumstances will be predominant in the networks of the near future. Current schemes for content download are inefficient at addressing the mentioned heterogeneity. The goal of this project is to obtain new and improved schemes that would result in better access to content for the users while improving the network utilization.<br/> <br/>The research will focus on three coding techniques to attack the problem: rateless coding at the application layer, network coding at the network layer, and collaborative coding at the physical layer. Quantitative and qualitative limitations of network and rateless coding in heterogeneous environments will be studied to develop new practical coding schemes appropriate in such circumstances. Another research direction is to investigate and analyze mechanism to make networks more uniform using physical layer collaborative transmission schemes. An assessment will be made on how this process affects the performance of the higher layer coding schemes. <br/><br/>Broader Impact: The research, if successful, will improve the efficiency and availability of data in networks. This has the potential to benefit directly and indirectly the population at large. In addition, this collaborative research has the potential to obtain fundamental new insights at the interface of coding and information theory and combinatorial optimization. Several PhD students will be supported and trained in interdisciplinary areas and they would also obtain valuable industrial experience.

Methods that have had success in this domain impose constraints on models incorporating notions of simplicity, smoothness, or robustness. The constraints are often formalized either as priors for Bayesian methods or as geometric criteria for machine learning methods. The heart of this proposal is to develop and relate the importance of the geometry underlying the data to probabilistic modeling. The specific research foci of the proposal are: 1) The exploitation of geometric assumptions for problems of model uncertainty and variable selection in high-dimensional models; 2) A Bayesian framework for the use of  ancillary or unlabeled data in predictive modeling; 3) Theory, methods and computation for nonparametric Bayesian kernel models; 4) Novel methods for nonlinear dimension reduction for high-dimensional data from regularization and geometric perspectives.<br/><br/>The proposal develops theory, methods and computational tools for statistical modeling motivated by applications in functional genomics. Modern molecular biology has generated data of a rapidly escalating scale and complexity -- high-throughput genomics data, genetic and sequence information, proteomic and metabolomic data, and other forms of more traditional biomedical or clinical information. Modeling this data for predictive phenotypes of prognosis, diagnosis, and  pathway deregulation as well as understanding relevant variables and their associations are fundamental challenges for modern statistics, machine learning, and data-mining research.   These methodological developments will have impact on several other scientific areas including biology, engineering, environmental and health science, and social sciences.<br/><br/><br/>

This infrastructure supports safety and verifiability for both high-level applications and low-level system code and includes a compiler-based virtual machine (LLVA) that can host an entire OS and all its applications, the Linux kernel (ported to the LLVA architecture), and development tools to compile and work with LLVA code. Building on techniques developed in the SAFECode in-house project, this virtual machine will enforce a safe execution environment for applications and even for legacy systems. The flexibility of the infrastructure permits individual components to be used separately and to be integrated into other systems. Important components include the LLVA instruction set, a run-time library implementing the kernel support functions, compiler modules, development tools, a Just-in-Time (JIT) engine for managing JIT compilation and caching, and the SAFECode compiler for enforcing memory safety for C programs and the kernel. The infrastructure also includes examples of course projects pre-packaged for instructor to use. Beginning with the prototype, major developments consist of modifying the compiler and JIT engine to be able to run without system services, assembling the components into a complete usable system, improving the robustness and performance, and adding usability features such as documentation, auto-configuration, automatic testing, bug tracking, and pre-packaged course projects. The infrastructure aims to enable approaches to intrusion detection and prevention, cross-program information flow, compilation certification, and formal verification of system software.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: This work enables research groups to undertake prohibitively difficult research providing new solutions that tackle hard problems such as insider threats, building scalable secure systems, information provenance, and security and privacy. Moreover, in addition to contributing to train students in the area, the infrastructure facilitates development of new and/or more ambitious course projects and education topics in OS, compiler, architecture, embedded and distributed systems<br/>

Future computing systems will see increased convergence of computation, communication, and sensing. They will be marked by massive distribution and will augment the physical environment, interacting with it under constraints of real time and space. This project develops a fundamental theory for computing the real-time capacity of such future systems which quantifies their ability to do timely work. A mathematical foundation is developed for composing real-time capacity expressions given application flow graphs, time constraints and resource topology. This foundation utilizes a small set of composition rules to arrive at application-aware capacity expressions. The project also considers the limits when system components become infinitesimal and the number of components needed for an application grows to infinity. Once a capacity region is constructed for a distributed system running a set of applications, various optimizations can be performed such as finding the point of maximum throughput within the capacity region. <br/><br/>

The recognition units to be developed are designed to pair with one another reversibly but with a strength that in apolar solvents is about 10% the strength of a carbon-carbon single bond. Both in their stability and fidelity of assembly they are superior to normal DNA base pairs. Easily scalable syntheses of derivatives of the units that can be clicked onto other small molecules, polymers, surfaces, and other materials will be developed. These results will be extended toward stimuli responsive units where an external stimulus, such as light or heat, turns the recognition unit on or off. A system that assembles spontaneously into cyclic, hexameric aggregates will be used to develop stimuli responsive (solvent) self-assembling star polymers that can self-organize into larger superstructures. Clickable recognition units will be exploited in a range of applications, including switchable, hydrogen-bonded multilayers.<br/><br/>With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. Steven C. Zimmerman, of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Illinois. Professor Zimmerman and his students are developing synthetic systems designed to recognize one-another and assemble spontaneously into multi-molecular aggregates on the basis of recognition units mimicking those found in DNA. Through the study of such systems, Professor Zimmerman is developing biologically inspired ways to construct complex multifunctional materials that display smart properties, including responsiveness to heat, light, and environment.

This team will complete and characterize two multi-band optical and infrared cluster surveys, the IRAC Shallow Cluster Survey (ISCS), using the Spitzer Space Telescope, and the Blanco Cosmology Survey (BCS), using the Blanco 4m telescope in Chile.  The BCS will be used to measure the galaxy power spectrum with 3.5 million galaxies extending to redshifts greater than one.  These new programs will be coordinated with current and forthcoming millimeter-wave surveys designed to find clusters using the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect.  Future surveys intended to deliver constraints on the dark energy equation of state will invariably be limited by systematic rather than statistical uncertainties.  The ISCS and BCS will clarify and quantify these systematic effects, while simultaneously obtaining new, near-term cosmological constraints.  The work uses catalog and cluster simulations to estimate precisely the survey completeness and contamination, and the cluster mass estimate accuracy.  It also focuses on fields with optical/infrared and mm-wave data, now or soon, and with some existing X-ray data.  The multi-wavelength approach enables a cross-calibration of the leading cluster selection methods, the possibility of developing cleaner and more sensitive selection techniques, and direct tests of the selection models.<br/><br/>This project will significantly impact larger experiments under way and to come.  Because the BCS will constitute the largest contiguous deep optical survey in the southern hemisphere, the resulting public data set will be of great value for numerous other applications, such as galaxy evolution studies.  This team has a record of working with K-12 teachers and students, and will expand that work in conjunction with the present research.

The emerging tele-immersive (TI) technology empowers and enables collaborative interactions and a plethora of new applications among geographically distributed sites. TI technology allows creation of a cyber TI room, where geographically separated users can jointly perform physical activities such as dance or exercise. This project is working to take this vision further and allow users to participate in simultaneous TI sessions and to cyber-walk between TI rooms.  To achieve the TI rooms vision, the underlying cyber-physical infrastructure must consider both (a) streams of 3D data as a first class object in its design and in its deployment, and (b) holistic end-to-end management of the multi-stream environments for each TI room.  Hence, the project is developing a Holistic Multi-stream Environment for Distributed Immersive Applications (H-MEDIA).  They will investigate (a) system architectures with correlated multi-streaming; (b) real-time virtualization of resources  for resource isolation between individual TI rooms and switching (cyber-walk) between rooms; (c) end-to-end configurable, robust and fault-tolerant virtual networks for different rooms; and (d) adaptive configuration and system  management that will yield customizable, stable, adaptable, available and robust individual TI rooms. H-MEDIA research will have impact on communities in computer science and also on medical, social science and other domains. The H-MEDIA project will also result in educational benefits such as involving graduate students research in very novel TI technologies, inclusion of undergraduate students, and impact on education in other disciplines such as new teaching of choreography in TI environments, as well as many others.

In the process it will develop novel computational techniques for analyzing large-scale networks, which will have applicability across a wide variety of domains.<br/><br/>The most important and complex decisions made by governments and organizations occur in group contexts. A central challenge, spurred by new developments in information technologies (IT), is that the nature of groups and how they operate has changed radically. Today, many groups ? in social, political, and economic contexts - are ad hoc, agile, transient entities that emerge from a larger primordial network of relationships. For a short time, these groups accomplish a variety of tasks, and then they dissolve, only to be reconstituted later with a different configuration. While there is growing awareness of the socio-economic consequences of these groups, our understanding of how they form and their impact on effectiveness is severely limited.<br/><br/>This project will address this limitation by developing a theoretical framework that reflects the contemporary conceptualizations of groups. It proposes a network approach to modeling the eco-system of overlapping and constantly changing groups that constitute the fabric of contemporary society. It recognizes that empirically testing such a model poses formidable data collection challenges. However, a unique resource available to the research team is access to all behavioral traces (server logs) from one of the world''s largest Massively Multiplayer Online (MMO) games, EverQuest 2, which is particularly well-suited to theorize and empirically model the dynamics of group behavior. MMOs comprise tens of thousands of players who are at any one point in time coalescing in thousands of groups to accomplish quests and raids that involve a variety of activities similar to tasks we undertake in real life ? finding information or materials, making, selling or buying products and services. <br/><br/>Beyond the data collection challenge, the scale of the proposed research enterprise also poses significant computational challenges in uncovering and analyzing the complexities that govern the dynamics of group behavior in these virtual worlds. Using advanced computing applications and technologies, this project seeks to capture, infer, and model the networks that explain how groups emerge and how they function. Specifically, the researchers will use temporally evolving graphs to model such networks, and develop scalable algorithms to compute metrics of group behavior on them. Tying these complex and shifting individual and networked behaviors to traditional forms of analyses represents a novel interdisciplinary challenge in both scope and complexity.<br/><br/>The project will expand our knowledge of how groups form and operate in larger ecosystems of groups, individuals, and organizations. The analysis of logs generated from Virtual Worlds poses novel challenges from a computational perspective. This interdisciplinary investigation will result in new (1) information models for modeling the Virtual World, (2) data structuring and algorithmic techniques for data access and analysis, and (3) techniques for computational efficiency.<br/><br/> The knowledge and tools developed in this research will allow researchers to understand more fully, and practitioners to cultivate more effectively, the emergence and performance of ad hoc groups in contemporary society. It will also provide other disciplines with new computational and statistical modeling methodologies and tools, which should have considerable positive implications for future research in other disciplinary areas. The findings and deliverables of the proposed research will be immediately generalizable to training and education related to groups (beyond just MMOs or Virtual Worlds), social networks, and online games.

Melton<br/><br/>Title: Doctoral Dissertation Research: Rediscovering the Party System and its Effect on Voter Turnout<br/><br/>0720318<br/><br/>Abstract<br/><br/>By defining the choices available for citizens to choose from, the structure of a country''s party system can influence whether or not its citizens turn out to vote.  In previous work, scholars studying voter turnout have used the number of parties as a proxy to represent all the components of the party system, but this approach has led to inconsistent and seemingly inexplicable empirical results.  The proposed study considers two additional components related to the spatial arrangement of the parties via the voter: (1) proximity of the closest party, or parties, to the voter''s ideal point and (2) relative distance between the two closest parties.  To date, scholars'' explanations of voter turnout across countries tend either to ignore or pay little attention to how these latter two party system characteristics affect people''s decisions whether or not to vote.  This dissertation seeks to identify how each of the party system characteristics, as well as the three in combination, influence turnout.  To test the effects of these characteristics, this investigation will use an experimental design to manipulate each of the three party system characteristics to determine their independent and joint effects.  The participants for the experiments will be US citizens from a large metropolitan area in the Midwest.  Each participant will be asked to answer several survey questions and participate in a mock election.  Based on the turnout in this mock election across the experimental conditions, the goal is to make generalizations about the effect of the party system on turnout.  If successful, this study has the potential to have an important impact on the field.  First, by demonstrating the independent effects of these three distinct components of the party system on turnout, scholars will have a more comprehensive understanding of how the party system affects turnout, and thus, will have a greater understanding of turnout in general.  Second, experiments have the potential to greatly improve the internal validity of comparative political research.  The successful use of an experimental design in this study may encourage other comparative political scientists to use experiments in their own research.  Scholars could even use this design as a template for future research interested in explaining how other institutional variables affect voter turnout.

The motivation to explore this line of thinking has come from the recent work of the PIs, which has indicated that segmentation trees have the potential of making a significant impact on the state of the art in object recognition. This finding is controversial as it contradicts a widely held belief in the vision community that since low-level image segmentation varies somewhat with imaging conditions, algorithms that use regions as image features cannot offer a reliable basis for image understanding.<br/>The main goal of this proposal is to address those concerns and obtain conclusive results to firmly establish or reject the PIs'  <br/>preliminary conclusions.<br/><br/>

A recurrent theme in these regulations is the need for regulatory-compliant storage as an underpinning to ensure data confidentiality, access integrity and authentication; provide audit trails, guaranteed deletion, and data migration; and deliver Write Once Read Many<br/>(WORM) assurances, essential for enforcing long-term data retention and life-cycle policies.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, current compliance storage WORM mechanisms are fundamentally vulnerable to faulty behavior or insiders with incentives to alter stored data because they rely on simple enforcement primitives such as software and/or hardware device-hosted on/off switches, ill-suited to their target threat model.<br/><br/>In this project, we will build a strongly compliant storage system for realistic adversarial settings, delivering guaranteed document retention and deletion, quick lookup, and compliant migration, together with support for litigation holds and several key aspects of data confidentiality.<br/><br/>Recent compliance regulations are intended to foster and restore humans trust in digital information records and, more broadly, in our businesses, hospitals, and educational enterprises. As increasing amounts of information are created and live digitally, compliance storage will be a vital tool in restoring this trust and ferreting out corruption and data abuse at all levels of society.

Multidisciplinary agendas are taking root and departmental walls are crumbling.<br/> Consider the three seemingly disparate fields of political science, psychology, and biology.  In decades past, political scientists excelled in studying the institutional dynamics of government; psychologists probed the human psyche employing Freudian and Pavlovian tools; biologists considered the workings of the cell a cutting-edge specialty.  Today, political scientists have commenced investigations of human social behavior as an artifact of genetic activity; psychologists employ the technologies of neuroscience to characterize the function of various brain centers in decision making; biologists extract candidate DNA from the genomes of sundry species in the search for commonalities in performance and adaptation.  Slowly but surely they are engaging in common cause.<br/> A first-ever national meeting of political scientists, psychologists, and biologists, young and old, for the purpose of mounting a concerted drive toward formalized dialogue and a hopeful pooling of theories and methods will be organized.  Put succinctly, the scholars involved in this confrence share a common vision:  genes appear to play a role in orchestrating the software and chemistry of human behavior; environmental and heritable regulation of gene activity may be an important factor in influencing our politics; long-term, the world of politics could well be a significant force in determining which genes will spread their numbers and which will prove wanting.  At this conference, participants shall read and critique one another''s papers and take the first steps toward a new world view of human behavior.<br/> By including young scholars in this undertaking, a new generation will be prepared to conduct research in the nexus of these fields.

Szekely	07/31/2010	$49,997.00		zengpen@auburn.edu	310 Samford Hall	Auburn University	AL	368490001	3348444438	MPS	1269	0000, OTHR	$0.00	This project is aimed to develop theory and methods for sufficient dimension reduction in regression analysis involving a large number of predictor variables. The investigators propose a general approach called the integral transform approach to facilitating dimension reduction. The key idea of this approach is to use integral transform and response transformation to change the domain where dimension reduction is <br/>performed. Due to the availability of a wide range of transformations and integral transforms, this approach leads to a flexible and effective framework for addressing and resolving challenges raised by high dimensionality. Through a series of well-defined research problems, the investigators study this framework and develop specific dimension reduction methods for many important regression applications. The success of this project not only provides effective practical tools for high-dimensional data analysis but also represents an advance in the theory and methodology of semiparametric inference.<br/><br/>High-dimensional data that involve a large amount of variables are nowadays routinely generated and collected in areas such as scientific research, government, business, etc. It is well-known that high dimensionality causes difficulties in processing and analyzing these data. This is commonly referred to as the curse of dimensionality. There is an urgent demand of statistical tools that are able to mitigate the curse of dimensionality through dimension reduction. This project represents an answer to this demand and is particularly aimed at achieving dimension reduction in regression. The results from this project can be widely applied in areas where regression involving a large number of variables is required. Gene expression and protein sequence data analysis is one such example. Therefore, this project can help enhance scientific research and discovery and benefit a variety of social and economical activities.

Brown	07/31/2008	$14,000.00		schunn@pitt.edu	University Club	Pittsburgh	PA	152132303	4126247400	SBE	7252	0000, OTHR	$0.00	Across the sciences, computational modeling is one the most widely-used methods for linking different levels of analysis, to show how processes at one level can interact to produce emergent system behavior at another level. Within the cognitive science, computational modeling has been used to link neural, mental, and behavioral levels of analysis, for instance. Computational modeling has also served as a common ground for drawing links across the various disciplines that comprise the cognitive sciences, such as cognitive neuroscience, linguistics, computer science, psychology, anthropology, philosophy, and education. Computational modeling has clearly become a valuable and oftentimes needed skill in the cognitive sciences, yet there are barriers to acquiring and practicing this skill for students and junior investigators entering the field. To encourage the practice of computational modeling, the National Science Foundation will support student training in computational modeling at the 2007 Meeting of the Cognitive Science Society. Support is aimed at getting students interested and involved in computational modeling, and providing tutorials that might spur them to seek further training opportunities through their institutions and other resources.

These systems will provide high resolution observations needed to evaluate cloud resolving and explicit cloud models, and to evaluate techniques for measuring precipitation remotely. The focus is on both shallow and deep convection, and stratiform precipitation, observed in a tropical/subtropical environment. The high sensitivity of the University of Miami (UM) 94 GHz radar, its high resolution temporal and spatial sampling, and the Doppler spectral processing techniques developed in previous studies will allow the PI to extend his studies of the dynamical and microphysical structure of precipitating and non-precipitating cloud systems. The scientific objectives of this study are to: <br/><br/>1) characterize the vertical structure of the small-scale vertical velocity structures and drop size distributions in stratiform rain and study how evaporation affects their vertical structure, and<br/>2) examine how the microphysics and dynamics of clouds above the melting layer affect the microphysics and vertical air velocities observed in stratiform rain just below the melting layer<br/><br/>A technological objectives of this study is to further develop the observing techniques pioneered by the UM group. In addition to the radar observations, upper-air soundings and surface rainfall measurements will be obtained to provide additional information on environmental and cloud conditions. Although opportunistic observations will be made throughout the duration of the 3-year project from UM's campus site on Virginia Key, an intensive observational period is planned for August-September of 2008. The south Florida location allows for sampling of both sea-breeze initiated convective-stratiform systems and those associated with tropical disturbances moving through or in the vicinity of the area.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The studies will lead to radar observational techniques that are of importance to broader radar and remote sensing community. The multiwavelength capability developed for this study will substantially enhance the existing radar capabilities of the US research instrumentation infrastructure. Data sets generated will be made available to the scientific community to enable applications beyond those of the direct scientific focus of this project. The use of an experimental fast-scan phased array Doppler radar will enable opportunistic observations of outer rainbands of land-falling hurricanes. These studies will also lead to an understanding of cloud and precipitation characteristics that can be used in the development of space-borne radar applications. The combined 95 GHz and longer wavelength radar operations represent a unique US university activity and provide an effective means of enhancing undergraduate and graduate education in radar meteorology and increasing public understanding of the technological and scientific advances in physical meteorology.<br/>

0727402	Collaborative Proposal:   Diapycnal Mixing on the East Pacific Rise	OCE	PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY	08/01/2007	08/26/2009	Louis St. Laurent	FL	Florida State University	Standard Grant	Eric C. Itsweire	01/31/2011	$234,879.00		lstlaurent@whoi.edu	874 Traditions Way, 3rd Floor	TALLAHASSEE	FL	323064166	8506445260	GEO	1610	0000, OTHR	$0.00	Observational studies indicate that mid-ocean ridges are sites where hydrodynamic processes act to enhance turbulent mixing. Previous studies have included measurements from slow-spreading ridges in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans, where the ridges are characterized by very rough topography with deep axial valleys and fracture-zone canyons. The interaction of tides with such topography gives rise to baroclinic currents, which locally enhance the internal-wave energy and increase the potential for instabilities that lead to turbulent mixing. Internal- wave driven mixing of this type has become the paradigm for the occurrence of turbulence in the deep ocean, and has been the basis for parameterizations of diffusivity for use in ocean models. However, recent work has demonstrated that the exceptional levels of turbulent mixing occurring at mid-ocean ridges may also be attributable to low-frequency flow, in particular on slow-spreading ridges where innumerable sills and constrictions support density driven overflows. The main goals of study is to make new observations to document the mixing processes acting on the fast-spreading East Pacific Rise (EPR) which, in comparison to slow-spreading ridges, is associated with much smoother topographic relief. The comparatively less rough topography prevents the considerable enhancement of internal wave energy seen elsewhere, leading previous studies to suggest only weak mixing near the EPR. However, a tracer-release experiment, conducted as part of the NSF-supported LADDER project, demonstrated turbulence levels corresponding to diffusivities of order 10 cm2 s-1, two orders of magnitude above typical thermocline levels. Observations of strong flow, shear, and velocity finestructure suggest that strong turbulence at this site extends beyond a simple bottom boundary layer, and contributes to significant mixing of stratified water above the ridge topography. The sampling program will consist of microstructure and lowered acoustic Doppler profiling, yielding both direct estimates of the turbulent dissipation rates and finestructure parameters. The microstructure measurements will be the first to characterize dissipation levels at any fast-spreading ridge site. We have the unique opportunity to join the final cruise of the LADDER program and contribute new measurements within the framework of existing and funded shiptime.<br/>Intellectual Merits: In spite of several decades of research, mixing in the deep ocean remains poorly characterized. In particular, all available measurements on which current roughness- based mixing parameterizations are based, were taken on slow-spreading ridges where different processes have been implicated in the observed high levels of mixing. Therefore, it is entirely unknown to what degree these parameterizations apply on fast-spreading ridges. The proposed microstructure survey will thus significantly extend the available mixing data set from the deep ocean to sites with different topographic characteristics. The measured dissipation rates will be used to improve mixing parameterizations to be used in numerical circulation and climate models.<br/>Broader Impacts: In addition to the physical process characterization and resulting implications for process parameterization in models, this study contributes in a fundamental way to the LADDER study of larval dispersion near active hydrothermal sites. The proposed work will also support a graduate student at FSU and a postdoctoral investigator at LDEO.<br/>
0727243	Do sediment-dwelling species have large ranges along a continental slope?	OCE	BIOLOGICAL OCEANOGRAPHY	08/01/2008	05/10/2010	David Thistle	FL	Florida State University	Standard Grant	David L. Garrison	07/31/2013	$605,261.00		thistle@ocean.fsu.edu	874 Traditions Way, 3rd Floor	TALLAHASSEE	FL	323064166	8506445260	GEO	1650	9117, 9169, 9251, BIOT, EGCH	$0.00	The sediment-covered deep-sea floor is arguably the largest habitat on Earth. Despite the extreme conditions, the number of species present at a given location for some taxa can rival that of the most species-rich groups in the most species-rich habitats on Earth (e.g., insects in rain forests).  The nature of this richness is controversial.  Some studies have reported that a few species had ranges of 100's to 1,000's of kilometers, but many species were found at only a single location.  In other work, many more species were reported to have large ranges.  Worse, the existing data may not be completely informative because the decisions about the assignment of individuals to species were made on the basis of morphology, which can fail to distinguish species that are biologically separate, and commonly known as cryptic species.  The question of how big is a species range in deep-sea sediments needs to be resolved because it matters profoundly to conceptual models of the ecology of deep-sea sediments.  If most species have small ranges, students of the deep sea will want to understand, for example, how species' ranges are bounded in an environment that appears to have few physical barriers.  Alternatively, if most species have large ranges, investigators will want to study issues related to the genetic connectivity of species over 100's to 1,000's of kilometers.  The primary objective of this project is to evaluate the possibility that some sediment-dwelling deep-sea species have large ranges.  To do that these investigators will collect sediment samples from one station at 2,700 m and one at 3,700 m depth at each of four latitudes (47.6∞ N, 42.6∞ N, 36.5∞ N, and 32.6∞ N) on the continental slope off the west coast of the United States.  The very common harpacticoid copepods will be the target group for this study.  Each adult harpacticoid from each sample will be assigned to a species on the basis of traditional morphological characters.  Each of these adult harpacticoid copepods will then be cut in two; the posterior portion will be used for DNA-sequence analysis, and the anterior will be retained as a voucher sample.  The DNA-sequence analysis will be used to determine whether the individuals deemed to be the same species on the basis of morphology form a well-supported species group based on molecular data.  The distribution of these species groups among stations will allow the investigators to know that its range is at least as large as the distance between the stations where they were found.  The proposed research could benefit society by helping policy makers evaluate the environmental cost of human disturbance of the deep-sea floor (e.g., ocean dumpingl) by beginning to clarify the relationship between species ranges and human disturbances.  The investigators will also share their results with colleagues through presentations at scientific meetings and in publications and to a wider audience by means of public lectures and a web site.  The project will also foster the participation of underrepresented groups in oceanography.

The methods and techniques will be combined into the remote-access SNe Ia computational pipeline, which comprises sophisticated 3D simulation algorithms for fluid dynamics, nucleosynthesis, and radiation transport, as well as tools for the 3D analysis of SNe Ia data.  SNe Ia are crucial for identifying the nature of dark energy, one of the most important problems facing modern science, because they serve as one of the most direct and precise distance indicators in the Universe.  The results of this study will improve the cosmological calibration of these critical tools, by trying to understand what affects their status as standard candles, notably the different types of progenitor systems, deviations from spherical symmetry, and interaction with circumstellar matter.  One important outcome will be a comprehensive set of observationally verified first-principles multidimensional explosion models of SNe Ia.  Identifying physical correlations among predicted and observed signatures of SNe Ia will be crucial for improving the accuracy of their calibration.<br/><br/>This work is an exceptional platform for introducing students to cross-disciplinary and multi-field science, through the many areas involved in studying SNe Ia, such as numerical methods, large-scale hydrodynamics and radiation transport simulations, observations, and cosmological applications.  Research results will be made available to the broad scientific community via the developed computational pipeline, and will be disseminated to the wider non-technical audience.  The results will also benefit current and future ground- and space-based observing programs.

Work over the past two decades has highlighted the role of Trichodesmium. More recently, the role of coccoid cyanobacteria as well as symbiotic associations of the filamentous cyanobacteria Richelia intracellularis with species of diatoms (Rhizosolenia and Hemiaulus) has received attention. Little is known of the growth rates, nutrient needs, chemical composition, or environmental tolerances of these diatom-diazotroph associations (DDAs). However, it is clear that DDAs are numerically important in some oceans and can play a major role in mediating new nitrogen inputs. Recent models have identified the need for species-specific parameters, but these are lacking for DDAs. In particular, temperature dependent properties require quantification for application to global warming scenarios. <br/><br/>Laboratory studies of the Rhizosolenia -Richelia DDA are now possible due to the reproducible cultivation of this association. This four-year research program will quantify temperature and salinity effects on growth rates and NB2B-fixation rates. It will explore the role of silicate and phosphate (inorganic and organic) in controlling growth rates, chemical composition and NB2B-fixation through host-symbiont interactions. <br/><br/>The mass accumulation of the DDAs in sediment traps as well as in the sedimentary record suggest DDAs are important vectors to depth. The potentially high sinking rates relative to Trichodesmium permit rapid export of new N and sequestration of C. This work will quantify settling rates under conditions of phosphate and silicate-limited growth and provide the first estimates of potential losses due to sinking. This program will provide the first broad characterization of a DDA and provide valuable input data for models. <br/><br/>The laboratory data will be used in a pair of cruises to the N. Pacific Ocean to quantify rates and limitations of DDAs known to occur there. Work will focus on the response to phosphorus additions using DDA growth rates and NB2B fixation. Concurrent studies using net tows will quantify growth rates of Rhizosolenia-Richelia under natural conditions. <br/>DDA blooms are potential means to remove C and N quickly from the euphotic zone via mass sedimentation of the diatom host. Diatom remains in sediments suggest this is an important vector for sedimentary deposition. The auteocological work in this study will produce information important for interpreting how such events can occur. In addition, temperature tolerance studies will yield data useful for understanding how this DDA could respond to warming oceans. <br/><br/>Broader Implications <br/><br/>Symbioses are a fascinating part of biology in general, and this work will enrich the biological literature by providing the first systematic study of the biology of marine DDAs. The data will provide important input data for biological and paleooceanographic models examining Nitrogen fixation and carbon flux into the deep sea.

This symposium is a follow-up to the S„o Carlos, S„o Paulo, Brazil Workshop, October 2006, the Workshop in Shanghai Conference at the Jiao Tong University, October 2005, the Berlin Conference in the Production Technology Center (PTZ), September 2004 and the Environmentally Benign Manufacturing (EBM) workshop held in Birmingham, Alabama, in January 2003.   This symposium brings together leading global researchers and practitioners to provide a forum for information sharing, collaboration opportunities, stakeholders dialogue on a subject of tremendous importance to our nation. The themes for this symposium is on the production of alternative energy systems, integration challenges in achieving sustainable production systems, and international collaboration in this field.  While most conferences focus on the energy technology itself, this conference will specifically address the sustainability of the systems and processes that go into the production of alternative energy sources as well as life cycle impacts. The broad utilization of a technology such as fuel cells cannot be realized unless these issues are addressed. The symposium will also address the topic of Integration in Sustainable Systems and Sustainable Processes for Production of Alternative Energy Systems as seen by industry, university, research, governmental, and independent institutions. <br/><br/>The symposium will also focus on integration challenges in achieving sustainable production systems. While progress has been made in many areas related to sustainable production, integration challenges in addressing the social, economic, and environmental aspects continue to represent a major obstacle to organizations. The symposium will provide a forum to discuss and explore ideas focused on addressing the integration challenges and assess the existing gaps. This will provide researchers an opportunity to identify the research and collaboration opportunities related to this challenge.  The symposium will bring together leaders from the US, Japan, China, Brazil, Germany to establish strategic direction and collaboration both for current and future engineers.<br/>

These dogs are exceptionally sensitive sensors for all known threat substances and existing dogs can be trained to meet new threats by detecting new substances in very rapid order. Temperamental factors (such as emotional stability and boldness) rather physical abilities (such as olfaction and endurance) are the primary determinant of MWD effectiveness in the field. However, several elements of the current temperament assessment program are suboptimal from the standpoint of scientific assessment: Little attention is paid to psychometric criteria, measurement methods are unrefined, little is known about tasks be predicted, and little is known about the performance of individual MWDs in the field. This work will develop and psychometrically validate a set of temperament measures designed to improve the effectiveness with which MWDs are selected, trained, and utilized in combat situations. Specifically, the work will implement more sensitive measurement methods, will undertake a task analysis of MWD behavior in the field, and will create a system to track how well individual dogs perform. The work will build on earlier research, which has shown that temperament can be assessed in dogs and other species with high degrees of reliability and validity. The work will follow three cohorts of dogs through selection, training, and utilization to evaluate (1) the psychometrics of the temperament tests, (2) the basic structure underlying differences in temperament, (3) the relative merit of different assessment methods, and, most crucially, (4) the degree to which performance in the field can be predicted from tests conducted when the MWDs are acquired and before and after training. The findings will be used to devise a new selection, training, and evaluation strategy to improve the Military Working Dog program.<br/>

The approach is to develop a novel near-field scanning probe with sub-diffraction-limit resolution by directly fabricating nanometer sized light source on patterned silicon probe tip, and to use the probe to identify the molecular signatures of breast tumors.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The key technology involves using patterned SOI wafer to create a nanoscale light source on the tip of a MEMS fabricated probe. The light source will be made between a pair of silicon electrodes located on the tip, through electrostatically trapping semiconductor nanoparticles (CdSe/ZnS). The expected optical aperture size is ~10 nm, an order of magnitude reduction from that of an advanced NSOM, which enables high resolution imaging of multimolecular complexes on living cells. The self-illuminating scanning probe can be batch fabricated in an array format, with the potential for electronics integration. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The proposed architecture will be extendable to imaging the development mechanics of other sub-cellular structures. Understanding development at cellular level is essential for understanding of human diseases caused by defects and errors in development and differentiation pathways. A Texas-wide interdisciplinary collaboration in biomedical engineering research and education has recently been initiated. This proposal reflects the inter-institutional goal to conduct cutting-edge research to advance the field of micro-nano scale photonics and MEMS for novel biomedical imaging, to provide outstanding teaching for students, and to attract minority especially Hispanic students into engineering professions.<br/>

Energy is the single greatest challenge facing humankind in the 21st century. Fuel cells offer tremendous promise for solving a variety of energy needs ranging from portable to automobile to stationary power, reducing our global dependence on oil and fostering future energy security, prosperity, and a cleaner environment. However, fuel cell technologies are confronted with numerous materials challenges associated with durability, performance, and cost, impeding the commercialization prospects. As evident from the 2004 National Research Council/National Academy of Engineering report and the American Physical Society report, a profound fundamental understanding of the chemical and physical processes in fuel cell materials is vital for enabling significant breakthroughs that will lead to enhanced fuel cell performance at an affordable cost. For example, the high cost and limited abundance of the currently used platinum catalysts pose serious problems for the commercialization prospects of fuel cells. This proposal addresses this critical issue by exploring new palladium-based alloy catalysts; the cost of palladium is one-fifth of the cost of platinum. Nanostructured palladium-based alloy catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are designed based on a guiding principle involving the pairing of a good oxygen-bond cleaving metal such as Co for first splitting the O-O bond to form adsorbed oxygen with a good oxygen-reduction metal such as Pd for efficiently reducing the adsorbed oxygen atoms to oxide ions. Potential catalyst compositions are identified by a cyclic voltammetric (CV) screening with glassy carbon microelectrodes. Multi-metallic binary and ternary alloy compositions consisting of palladium and other metals like Ti, V, Cr, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Mo, W, Ru, Au, and Pt are synthesized by novel low temperature approaches such as a reverse microemulsion method employing different reducing agents like sodium formate or sodium borohydride and polyol reduction methods, followed by heat treatment at moderate temperatures to achieve a high degree of alloying and homogeneity, small and uniform distribution of particle size, high catalytic activity, and good chemical stability. The alloy catalysts are characterized by a variety of physical techniques including diffraction, microscopy, spectroscopy, and electrochemical measurements (cyclic voltammetry, linear polarization, and rotating disk electrode methods). The catalytic activity is evaluated for both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) in single cell proton exchange membrane fuel cells and direct methanol fuel cells with hydrogen and methanol fuels. Based on the results, a fundamental understanding of the catalytic mechanisms is developed.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The intellectual merit of the proposed activity is to (i) develop a basic scientific understanding of the factors that control the electrocatalytic activity of nanostructured palladium-based alloy catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction and methanol oxidation reaction in fuel cells, and (ii) utilize the knowledge to design and develop new less expensive, more efficient palladium-based catalysts for fuel cells. Palladium-based alloy catalysts designed with a guiding principle are synthesized by controlled, low temperature methods to keep the particle size small and maximize the catalytic activity, screened with cyclic voltammetry, and characterized by a variety of physical, chemical, and electrochemical techniques to establish the catalytic mechanisms involved. The proposed research activity will enhance our fundamental understanding of the structure-property-performance relationships of electrocatalysts and the commercialization prospects of fuel cell technology.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: The proposed research provides a broader interdisciplinary training to students in a unique, nationally important area of materials for energy conversion, encompassing materials chemistry and electrochemical science and engineering. The realization of a strong scientific basis in this area can help to design and develop new materials for power sources for portable, automobile, and stationary applications, which would have a profound societal impact. The proposed activity also aims to recruit and train minority and women students and educate K-12 students and the general public about clean energy technologies and materials.<br/>

But not all radiations are adaptive. The Cape flora of southern Africa is among the richest and most diverse in the world, but its diversity appears to involve both adaptive and non-adaptive evolution. This project will examine a group in the plant family Proteaceae to determine whether its radiation has been primarily adaptive or non-adaptive. Plant traits will be measured in experimental gardens and wild populations to determine their relationship to growth and reproduction and to identify traits associated with species differences. Variation in these traits will be compared to variation in neutral genetic markers to determine trait differences are the result of natural selection or of random differentiation associated with geographic isolation.<br/><br/>Scientists from the South African National Biodiversity Institute (SANBI) will collaborate on the project, and the project will enhance SANBI''s bioregional planning initiatives.  Field work will immerse faculty, students, and post-doctoral research associates in a rich multicultural environment. The project will engage both undergraduates and high school students, with special emphasis on high schools with large proportions of students from groups underrepresented in science.

They govern the structure and mechanical and adhesive behavior of the films. SAMs are important for a wide range of engineered systems, from adhesives to micromachine lubricants to nanolithography and nanostructured devices and materials. In all cases, the adhesive, frictional and mechanical behavior must be understood for the design of systems that make use of SAMs However, very little is known about this behavior, particularly under combined loadings.<br/>The hypothesis for this study is that the mechanical behavior of SAMs may be obtained from molecular analyses of relatively simple stress states and used in continuum analyses of more complex stress states that arise in nanoindentation experiments and in the growing array of SAM-based materials systems and structures. This hypothesis will be examined for several different SAMs and surfaces using molecular analyses of a broader range of simple characterizing stress states and time scales, and normal indentation experiments coupled with tangential loading using interfacial force microscope probes.<br/>The project will provide broadly trained students who will be productive working in interdisciplinary environments at universities or in industry. One undergraduate student will also be incorporated in the project. Texas demographics are such that the undergraduate body at UT-Austin has a significant Hispanic representation (~20% in the ASE Department), who we successfully encourage to participate in our undergraduate outreach programs.<br/><br/>

The investigators in this collaborative research program will study flame spray pyrolysis (FSP) numerically as a means of manufacturing doped metal-oxide nanoparticles, developing a predictive modeling tool.  <br/><br/>The project involves several elements - turbulent flame, spray dynamics, pyrolysis reaction and their mutual interactions and five institutions  the University of Texas Austin, Iowa State University, Ames Research Laboratory, Millennium Inorganic Chemicals, Inc., and the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETH Zurich). Five sub-tasks (chemical mechanism, particle evolution, flame/particle interaction, model validation and data access tool) are divided among the three lead investigators.  The participants will interact through a cyberinfrastructure collaboratory that has intellectually interesting elements in itself.  <br/><br/>The proposed model will use a unified Large Eddy Simulation / Filtered Density Function approach with a goal of optimizing FSP production routes for manufacture of doped zirconia and titanium dioxide nanoparticles, specifically prediction of final particle size distribution in FSP reactors. The filtered density function concept is a very promising approach to combustion LES, and the proposed work is an excellent example of complementary studies.<br/><br/>The success of this project is also expected to have a significant impact on combustion-turbulence modeling, applicable to fields such as fire dynamics and soot modeling, and to expand understanding in an area where the research can benefit many diverse technological disciplines. <br/><br/>Research results will be integrated into graduate and undergraduate curricula, and the project will train graduate and undergraduate research students. Recruitment of women and under-represented minority is a goal in both institutions, leveraging university assets for recruitment and employment of students from traditionally underrepresented groups.<br/><br/><br/>

These are critical parameters in the modeling of ozone remote sensing data and retrieval of its mesospheric density. Two independent experimental methods will be employed. In the first approach, a fraction of ozone is photo-dissociated by a 266-nm laser pulse, generating atomic oxygen and causing a temperature jump. The populations in the excited (010) and (001) vibration levels will be monitored using transient diode laser absorption spectroscopy as they equilibrate, providing information on the corresponding relaxation rate coefficients. To avoid complications from the temperature-jump approach, the second approach will involve direct pumping of the (001) vibration with a pulsed IR laser to produce vibrationally excited ozone. After performing experiments at room temperature, temperature dependence of the rate coefficients in the 150-350 K range, which is more relevant to the upper mesosphere and lower thermosphere region, will be studied. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of the project are substantial.  First, undergraduate students will be involved in every aspect of the proposed research project, including experimental design, data collection, signal processing, electronics and computer interfacing, data analysis, kinetic modeling, and dissemination of results at local symposia and regional or national scientific meetings. In addition to laboratory experiences at Bucknell University, the students will be engaged in data analysis and kinetic modeling activities at the AFRL hanscom AFB through the collaboration that has already been established between these two groups.  In this, the proposal offers unique and excellent opportunities for undergraduate student research experiences.  Second, the methods and results have general utility within atmospheric chemistry and ozone research and will lead to greatly improved capabilities to track long term variations in climate.  <br/><br/>

Authigenic sepiolite and palygorskite clays form in stage II carbonate pendants and stage III - VI petrocalcic horizons. Accurately dating petrocalcic soils remains one of the largest scientific hurdles in both geomorphology and sedimentology.<br/><br/>We propose an untested, novel approach to date authigenic sepiolite and palygorskite from petrocalcic horizons using 40Ar/39Ar geochronology. Our theoretical considerations suggest that the techniques we present herein are feasible, are applicable to many soils worldwide, and may help quantify rates of pedogenesis, landscape evolution, and climate change. If successful, our methodology would apply not only to extant petrocalcic soil landscapes, but also to the paleosol record. Lack of initial success will still enhance further soil geochronology research.<br/><br/>We propose to analyze samples from two well-dated petrocalcic soil localities:  Mormon Mesa, NV, and La Mesa, NM. We will also study purchased, reference sepiolite and palygorskite samples. We will extract sepiolite and palygorskite from 1) cemented, bulk soil samples and 2) microdrilled subsamples. Successful microdrill methods may expedite sample preparation for 40Ar/39Ar dating, given new micromorphological evidence (Brock & Buck, 2006) that authigenic clays often form within concentrated, macroscopically visible laminae. After each extraction step, we will analyze sample aliquots using SEM, XRD, and ICP-OES to identify or discount adverse effects on clay crystal lattice integrity or K content. TEM analyses will constrain compositional variability of extracted clays. 40Ar/39Ar measurements on successfully extracted clays will be made at the Nevada Isotope Geochronology Laboratory (NIGL) using vacuum encapsulation. Our final 40Ar/39Ar data and soil age interpretations will be compared to established tephrachonologic and morphostratigraphic ages for the Mormon Mesa and La Mesa surfaces. At the conclusion of our project, we will have answered the following questions: (1) Does chemical removal of pedogenic carbonate, amorphous silica, and iron-oxide cements affect crystal integrity or intracrystalline K and Ar content of fibrous clay minerals? (2) Does microdrilling of fibrous clays from petrocalcic samples affect crystal integrity or intracrystalline K and Ar content? (3) What mass of sepiolite or palygorskite is needed to minimize 40Ar/39Ar uncertainty? (4) Is 40Ar/39Ar geochronology of pedogenic sepiolite/palygorskite a viable means of numerically dating petrocalcic soilgeomorphologic surfaces?<br/><br/>Broader impacts of this research include the dissertation research and graduate training of a Ph.D. student, Colin Robins, and the training of a (probable female) undergraduate student. NIGL personnel, including graduate research assistants, will improve methodologies and knowledge of dating fine-grained materials. This will enhance other cutting-edge research applications such as dating fault gouge to determine timing of motion on shallow crustal faults. Collaboration with NMSU personnel will strengthen arid-lands research on a regional scale.<br/><br/>

It is refining and testing these modules with diverse chemical engineering students at five partner schools, with particular outreach to underrepresented student populations. The modules are designed to give students carefully designed situations where reality, rather than the professor, can dispute their misconceptions. These educational materials are being disseminated through a variety of mechanisms, including an on-site faculty workshop as well as an instruction manual with inquiry-based activities, supplementary instructional aids, and reliable assessment tools. The effectiveness of the materials is being assessed using previously developed concept inventories as part of a comprehensive evaluation plan coordinated by an outside evaluation expert. The project is providing evidence about whether this approach can be used to address a broad range of persistent misconceptions in engineering science and whether it can improve underrepresented student retention. Finally, these materials can be used for ABET accreditation, since they provide a proven vehicle for addressing important learning outcomes and a valid and efficient assessment tool to document students' learning gains.  <br/>  <br/>

Associated with this rainfall change, surface air temperatures have cooled during recent decades over central East China, in contrast to the general warming trend in the Northern Hemisphere and the globe. Understanding the causes and physical processes underlying these decadal rainfall changes represents a significant challenge for climate scientists. Recent studies suggest that several factors, including aerosols from air pollution, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), and tropical sea surface temperature (SST), may have played a role in causing the recent climate changes over East Asia. There are, however, few detailed studies on the physical mechanisms that can explain the observed climate changes over this region. <br/><br/>The PI has evaluated all the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report (IPCC AR4) models in terms of their ability to simulate the East Asian Summer Monsoon. They will now study the decadal rainfall changes in East Asia and, in particular, the widespread drought in North China during recent decades. They will focus on analyzing existing and new historical simulations using the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) and Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) atmospheric global climate models (GCMs) forced by observed tropical, North Pacific, or global SST only; by East Asian aerosols only; and by greenhouse gases only during the later half of the 20th century. The goal is to quantify the relative role of these individual forcings in causing the observed rainfall changes over East Asia and to diagnose underlying physical processes. Besides examining precipitation and atmospheric circulation fields, other fields such as the Palmer Drought Severity Index will also be computed and analyzed to better characterize the drought in North China. Reanalysis data will also be used and compared with some of the model simulations to help understand atmospheric processes involved. The model analyses will be extended to the IPCC AR4 21st century simulations in order to assess potential future changes in monsoon rainfall and drought severity and extent in East Asia.  The results from this project will help evaluate the NCAR and GFDL climate models and improve our knowledge about decadal changes in precipitation and drought over East Asia. <br/><br/>Broader impacts resulting from this project will be to improve our understanding of climate trends and projections in a region of the world that supports the livelihoods of more than a billion people. The project will enable an extended visit to NCAR by a graduate student.<br/>

The climates of these time periods include warm hothouse and cold icehouse climate regimes. Climate models are currently being applied to study how these climates are maintained and how the climate system changes through geologic time. A unique challenge for integrating the climate deep time simulations is that many geoscientists, interested in these simulations, are not climate modelers. This grant supports a deep time liaison position at the National Center for Atmospheric Research to aid the deep time community in simulating climates of the deep past. The liaison will work with university faculty who need support to carry out pre-quaternary climate simulations with the Community Climate System Model (CCSM). The specific tasks of the liaison will include: collaborations with university investigators to develop tools and documentation to facilitate the setting up of deep time CCSM climate simulations, the carrying out of deep time CCSM simulations on NCAR supercomputers, the facilitation of archiving model output and supporting a web based system to make output available to the university community, the transfer of deep time model simulation output to the university community, the diagnosis of CCSM deep time climate simulations using diagnostic tools, and the sponsoring of training workshop to the community at large on deep time climate modeling. The availability of the liaison services for the user community will be made known through the CCSM Paleoclimate Working Group, national meetings, and workshops focused on specific deep time events.

Through this integration, the community is essentially rewriting the paradigm for understanding how mountain ranges come and go, how landscapes evolve and respond to both external and internal forcings, and how climate and the land surface co-evolve. The scope of the new paradigm spans many orders of temporal and spatial scale, from natural hazards (e.g., landslides) all the way through to mantle convection.<br/><br/>Of all the couplings that are found to be important, few are as fundamental as that between surface and atmospheric processes - between geomorphology and climate. Recent advances put us in a position to forge serious links between the atmospheric communities and the earth-surface community: a) landscapes are being revealed to us at an unprecedented level of detail, largely though remote sensing techniques; b) advances in low-temperature geochronology and cosmogenic radionuclides allow for more confident dating of specific events and rates of processes; c) the theoretical development of physically-based geomorphic transport laws; d) computational advances permit mesoscale modeling of atmospheric processes on scales relevant to landscapes; and e) remote sensing of climate and vegetation affords unprecedented spatial and temporal observations. We are now able to know how the landscape is shaped, how fast it is shaped, and what the landscape really looks like.<br/><br/>The proposed workshop is about connecting these advances. Engaging the atmospheric sciences and landscape communities is critical if full advantage is to be taken of the possibilities available. Landscape dynamics can be seen as an archetypal case study of Earth System Science, spanning as it does, processes ranging from the crust deformation to cloud microphysics. The individual pieces are clearly in place. The challenge is in coming together as a community to figure out how to combine them as effectively as possible.<br/><br/>Goals:-<br/>1. To engage the atmospheric science and landscape dynamics communities in a conversation about effective joint research directions and possible collaborations.<br/>2. For the landscape dynamics community: to get better acquainted with what can be known about relevant atmospheric processes, and to address how that knowledge might be incorporated into landscape dynamics research.<br/>3. For the atmospheric sciences community: to learn about the novel and exciting research opportunities in studying landscape dynamics; to challenge and extend existing understanding of climate by asking new questions from different perspectives.<br/>4. Generate a white paper for both the community at large and for the NSF, the purpose of which is to provide a state-of-the-art report and a research agenda, to be written by a smaller sub-set of the workshop participants. In order that the white paper is inclusive and as open as possible, we will circulate drafts to the community for comments, suggestions, etc.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:-<br/>Educational. 15 to 20 graduate students will be invited to the workshop. Their participation in charting a course for research for the future will be illuminating for them and will help ensure that the ideas raised have a long-term influence.<br/><br/>Intellectual. Interdisciplinary collaboration is the future of Earth Sciences, and understanding landscape dynamics is one of the great challenges of the whole field. Historically progress has been impeded by traditional disciplinary boundaries. This workshop is an opportunity to establish a lasting legacy of greater communication.
0723392	Bat Wing Structure and the Aerodynamic Mechanisms of Flapping Flight	IOS	Physiolg Mechansms&Biomechancs	09/01/2007	08/14/2007	Sharon Swartz	RI	Brown University	Standard Grant	Mark R. Brodl	08/31/2010	$279,331.00	Kenneth Breuer, David Laidlaw	sharon_swartz@brown.edu	BOX 1929	Providence	RI	029129002	4018632777	BIO	7658	9150, 9178, 9179, 9183, BIOT	$0.00	Flight is the most common mode of animal locomotion, used by over 1200 species of bats, 10,000 birds, and more than a million species of flying insects.  It is thus surprising that understanding of the mechanics, aerodynamics, and evolution of biological flight is quite limited.  For example, it was long believed that the wings of bats generate lift in the same way as human-engineered airplanes.  Recently, it has been demonstrated that the aerodynamics of bat wings are very different from those of rigid wings, and that bat wings undergo enormous shape changes during flight.  Two major impediments to in-depth understanding of bat flight are lack of information about the mechanically unique bone, skin, and muscle of bat wings, and the limited ability of human scientists to consider many complex streams of data, such as wing motions, air velocities, and degree of bone bending, together at one time.  An interdisciplinary team of researchers from Brown University will carry out the first detailed mechanical tests on the special materials of bat wings, and document the degree to which bat bones bend and skin stretches then recoils during flight.  These results will be interpreted by novel computer visualization tools that will bring 3D virtual reality out of the gaming world and into scientific research. One of the broader impacts of this project will be the training and mentoring of a number of undergraduate and graduate students from biology, engineering, and computer science.  They will learn to work together effectively, aided by new interdisciplinary courses that will be developed by team faculty.  Visualization techniques developed here will have broad application in the natural sciences.  Additionally, progress will be made toward identifying biological design characteristics that can be used in the future for the construction of novel technologies such as miniaturized autonomous air vehicles.

The instruments include a new patrol Fabry-Perot interferometer (FPI), an all-sky Doppler imager (ASDI), and a spectrometer.  The observations will be used to systematically address a number of issues in mesospheric and thermospheric physics.  Research will include the study of mid-latitude mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) tides using the combined FPI mesospheric and thermospheric Doppler winds and all-sky images from hydroxyl and oxygen emissions and incoherent scatter radar observations.  The semidiurnal tide usually has a large vertical wavelength so the combined observations will provide a large vertical altitude coverage during both the day and night, and will allow for a better characterization of the vertical tidal structure.  Also, the all-sky imager at Millstone Hill will record the hydroxyl, sodium, and oxygen nightglow emissions for gravity wave activity and the investigators will use the FPI neutral winds from the same emissions to calculate the intrinsic gravity wave parameters.  From the intrinsic parameters, they will deduce the propagation modes of the waves and several important wave parameters including quantitative measurements of vertical scale-sizes, estimates of the vertical fluxes of horizontal wave momentum and energy, and the amount of wave flux divergence between the airglow layers, the hydroxyl and oxygen layers, in particular.  The FPI neutral wind and temperature measurements will be used to study the long-term trends in the mesosphere and thermosphere in connection with the solar cycles, and small-scale thermosphere temperature and neutral wind variations will be studied using the all sky Doppler imager.  The regional cluster of optical instruments in conjunction with the Millstone Hill Incoherent Scatter radar will provide comprehensive coverage from the mesosphere to the thermosphere.  They will provide a unique data set for studies of MLT dynamics and ionosphere/thermosphere interaction in the sub-auroral region.  Multi-institute participation will foster more collaboration between different research groups.  The Millstone Hill optical instruments will also be the test bed for the future distributed instrument projects.

From the perspective of microsystems technology research, this project integrates multi-sensing, information extraction, and wireless communication functionalities ? all in one very compact device. In this over-arching concept, the multi-sensing could include acoustic, seismic, magnetic, biological, and image (visible or IR), among others. The present investigation will involve design, fabrication, and test of electrical sensors (relevant to the power lines ? transmission or distribution, and related equipment), vias between the sensor plane and the processing plane, and stacking issues, including thinning, planarization, alignment, and bonding. It will also address the design and simulation of analog circuits, data converters, and digital signal processing (DSP) cells (which will be customized for power grid application), and very importantly, a framework for the needed digital processing. The latter will include automatic compensation in case of sensor relocation for defect circumvention on the sensor plane. Putting all the pieces together, an overall architecture will be developed and verified. In particular, the mapping of fault detection and its localization (distance calculation) to a systolic architecture using the proposed single-cycle DSP cells will be performed. Two related issues, namely the on-chip binding network and sensor fusion will be addressed in a future full proposal. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The proposed research focuses on developing technology for microsystems that could be used for monitoring the electrical power grid.  This application has high strategic importance.  While only one graduate student will be directly supported through this grant, it is anticipated that a few other G and UG students will also be trained. Special effort will be made to recruit women, minority, or disabled students to fill these supported research positions. The project will significantly benefit a course that the PI is developing on heterogenous microsystems. Technology transfer to the industry will be carried out through conference and journal publications, and through a web site. <br/><br/>

Scientifically, the overarching theme is large multi-scale nonlinear systems and the mathematical and numerical methods needed to analyze them.  We are interested in applications that are highly nonlinear, noisy, have a large number of components, and evolve over an extensive range of spatial and temporal scales.  The models are physically realistic but are so difficult that direct numerical simulations are not able to faithfully reproduce the processes they are intended to describe.  Our research objective is to provide a more in-depth analysis, and this invariably involves integrating modeling, computations, and analysis with contemporary experimental research.<br/><br/>The core of our program is mentored participation of students and postdocs in an interdisciplinary research team.  At the same time, the activities we will develop will reach a wide audience and combine research, mentoring, and broad education experiences.  Specific examples are Applied Math Days and mini-symposia.  Also included in this effort will be innovative curricular changes that will provide mentored transitions that will both increase the number of students interested in, and prepared for, graduate school in mathematics and which will also prepare our graduate students and postdoctoral associates for careers in academia or industry.  In addition we will develop innovative recruitment and retention components, as well as careful management and assessment of the program.

This program is motivated by recent advances which offer the promise of modeling human cognition mathematically. The workshop will entail presentations by leading faculty-level lecturers and an audience of graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and more senior researchers interested in focusing their efforts on probabilistic models of cognition and their applications. Attendees will represent a number of disciplines, including cognitive science, neuroscience, computer science, mathematics, physics, statistics, engineering, and education. Researchers interested in education should be equipped with a wide range of new computational, mathematical and statistical tools that can be used to improve educational technology, curriculum design and assessment, through the development of qualitatively more powerful models of human learning. Researchers in all of these fields, as well as basic cognitive-science researchers, should benefit immensely from interacting with each other and learning about this new generation of cognitive modeling approaches in an unprecedented interdisciplinary environment, with both basic and applied research themes represented among the lectures and discussions.

The essential mathematical basis for this study comes from the theory of percolation.  Building on recent results in continuum percolation, the project designs network structures to greatly enhance the resilience of large-scale wireless networks to node and link failures resulting from attacks, natural hazards or resource depletion.  Expected results from the project include (1) deeper understanding of percolation processes and resilience in large-scale wireless networks with multiple transmission power levels and channel fading, (2) analysis of network resilience to degree-dependent and cascading node failures, (3) design of wireless networking structures which maximize resilience to random node and link failures, (4) understanding of percolation and resilience in wireless networks described by signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio models and directed graphs, and (5) percolation and resilience in mobile wireless networks.  This project will (1) have direct and long-term impact on the reliability and security of wireless network architectures used in national<br/>security, commercial enterprise, scientific exploration and research, health services, and other important social projects, (2) impact undergraduate and graduate education through a planned course, (3) enhance research and education infrastructure through partnering with other university departments, government research institutions, and industry, and (4) enhance scientific and technological understanding through publications as well as participation in multi-disciplinary conferences and workshops.<br/><br/><br/>
0721040	Doctoral Dissertation Research in Economics:   Technology Adoption, Imperfect Asset Markets, and Risk in Economic Development:   Evidence from Dairy Farming in India.	SES	ECONOMICS	08/01/2007	08/05/2007	Dean Karlan	CT	Yale University	Standard Grant	Nancy A. Lutz	07/31/2009	$15,975.00	Santosh Anagol, Sendhil Mullainathan	dean.karlan@gmail.com	Office of Sponsored Projects	New Haven	CT	065208327	2037854689	SBE	1320	9179, SMET	$0.00	<br/>This research explores how common constraints on economic behavior such as (1) psychological biases, (2) inability to prove quality, and (3) inability to insure risks affect the development process.  These projects will expand the literature on economic development by illustrating how these constraints affect the practice of dairy farming in rural India, and will improve policymaking by bringing attention to these constraints and their effects.            <br/><br/>The first project studies the law of small numbers bias in the context of artificial insemination of dairy animals in rural India.  The law of small numbers bias is the human tendency to assume small samples of evidence adequately represent the underlying random process.  Despite the proven benefits of artificial insemination, Indian farmers use artificial insemination in less than thirty five percent of their inseminations.  This project will test whether dairy farmers who experience initial failure with artificial insemination are less likely to try the procedure again even when the initial failure was most likely by chance.  This effect would suggest that farmers evaluate artificial insemination based on the small sample of their own experience.  Given that most technologies go through a period of experimentation, the results of this study will be useful in understanding the dynamics of technology adoption in other contexts as well.      <br/>   <br/>The second project explores the relationship between quality uncertainty and market efficiency in two ways.  The first test will estimate whether higher quality cows receive lower prices than expected because their owners have no way to prove their quality; if this is true, it provides another reason why households do not upgrade their stock of animals through artificial insemination.  The second test will determine whether farmers wait for their cows to become pregnant before selling them as a way to prove their cow's fertility.  If this effect is found, it suggests that quality uncertainty makes cows a sub-optimal savings device.                  <br/><br/>The third project studies how dairying households respond to the risk associated with the gender of calves.  The development economics literature has stressed the importance of risk in the lives of the poor because a household living near subsistence will find consumption fluctuations especially painful.  Female calves are worth more than male calves because they will give milk and produce more calves.  This project will (1) estimate the magnitude of calf gender risk that households face, (2) assess whether households use any cow trading strategies to hedge this risk, and (3) estimate whether households that are lucky to have female calves grow their herd sizes faster than households that have male calves.                   <br/><br/>Broader Impact<br/>Approximately seventy million Indian households, which represent thirty six percent of the total number of households, engage in milk production.  These households are typically poor, rural households that rely on milk production to supplement their volatile crop based incomes.  This research will inform policymakers on increasing the efficiency of dairy farming and thereby contribute to poverty alleviation in India.   <br/><br/>

Patterns and behaviors (especially of humans) will be parsed by a hierarchy of probabilistic grammars and other mechanisms into a compact and more descriptive semantic form. These higher-level interpretations of the data will provide the necessary network cognition needed to provide services in many everyday life applications such as assisted living, workplace safety, security, entertainment and more. The project will use a lightweight camera sensor network as its primary platform and will focus on two types of spatio-temporal data processing. At the local sensor's field of view, this research will investigate the design of filters for robustly detecting humans as well as their gestures and postures. At a more macroscopic level, collections of sensors will coordinate to detect longer term patterns of behavior.  The expected outcome is a new data interpretation framework that can understand the spatial and temporal aspects of data and respond to them with meaningful services. To collect real data and to demonstrate the developed concepts in practical applications, this work will use assisted living as the driver application. In this context, the developed sensor network will supervise the behaviors of elders living alone at home to generate daily activity summaries,  post warnings and alarms when they engage in dangerous activities, and provide a variety of services that increase the autonomy and independence of these individuals.
0720106	Doctoral Dissertation Research in Political Science:   The Third Wave Reversed:   Undercurrents of Authoritarianism in the Former Soviet Union	SES	POLITICAL SCIENCE	08/01/2007	08/05/2007	Susan Stokes	CT	Yale University	Standard Grant	Brian D. Humes	07/31/2009	$12,000.00		susan.stokes@yale.edu	Office of Sponsored Projects	New Haven	CT	065208327	2037854689	SBE	1371	9179, SMET	$0.00	This research seeks to explain the conditions under which citizens in several post-Soviet nations prefer more or less authoritarian forms of government in order to understand why democratic transitions ultimately fail or succeed, as this research argues that the public's preferences are a central factor in determining whether or not democracy can survive.  While the broader research program explores these issues in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Estonia, this project conducts nationwide surveys of 2,000 respondents in Ukraine and 1,500 respondents in Belarus.  The survey data will be combined with sub-national economic data to allow statistical analysis of the individual and community-level attributes that shape preferences for authoritarianism and to conduct cross-national comparisons with the other post-Soviet countries.<br/> <br/>Unlike existing research on authoritarianism, this research explores the often-overlooked demand side of authoritarianism from the citizenry.  Because the countries studied have met a minimal level of democratic governance in the post-Soviet era, understanding the factors that lead citizens in these nations to elect authoritarian leaders is an important aspect of regime transitions. Early examinations of democratization naively assumed that the post-Soviet states were developing toward democracy, ignoring the possibility that reverse transitions to authoritarianism were possible.  Furthermore, literature on the breakdown of authoritarian regimes focuses on cataclysmic events such as coups and revolutions that replace previous regimes from above.  This project provides a theory of when citizens enable, tolerate, and prefer authoritarian rule in weakly democratic countries.  Finally, the surveys conducted in this study will fill a void in research on democratization by providing questions that researchers can use to examine people's attitudes toward authoritarian government.<br/><br/>Broader Impact<br/> <br/>In addition to advancing the political science scholarship on regime transitions and generating new data on topics that have been previously understudied, this research can have important impact beyond the academic realm.  The question of why democracy succeeds in some contexts and fails in others is very important to academics and policymakers alike.  Yet this question takes on increased significance in the current era when the United States is attempting to create new democracies in areas that have a history of authoritarian rule.  Research into the demands by the citizenry for authoritarian forms of government not only allows policymakers to realistically evaluate the probability of successful democratization in the future, but also allows them to formulate policies that give democracy the strongest probability of success.  Thus, the broader impact of this research has the potential to inform central aspects of foreign policy.<br/>

These computations can often be viewed as complex data flow graphs having components that are both data- and computationally- intensive, and requiring access to live data feeds and access to large-scale computational resources. A user may cycle through multiple graphs accessing data from sensors, instruments, databases, and large collections of files in the process of discovering new knowledge. This research investigates a programming model and framework for knowledge discovery in data-driven applications. Users program the system by declarative specification of detect-analyze-response behavior. Underlying the programming model is a continuous rule-based events processor and workflow orchestration engine organized as Web services. The research formalizes an abstract model of interaction and will map the higher-level conceptualization to the events processing and workflow runtime components. It demonstrates that the model supports a unique adaptive framework where knowledge gained from the computational and data analysis can be fed back to the data event streams. The approach is validated experimentally through quantifiable metrics and by its application to two model problems: severe storm prediction where a weather forecast is triggered based on data mining results from mining radar or model data, and adaptive resource management where hardware and software resources and environment data streams are monitored for on-the-fly resource requirements<br/>prediction.

A large number of today's systems software and virtual<br/>machines use various forms of the RCM constructs---many of which are<br/>often targets for security attacks. Unfortunately, existing<br/>logic-based formal methods---including both program verification and<br/>model checking---all assume that program code is immutable.  This<br/>project aims to fix this major limitation so that existing<br/>verification technologies can also be used to certify important<br/>software that use RCM functionalities (e.g., OS boot loader, virtual<br/>machine, JIT compiler, dynamic linker and loader). The PI will adapt<br/>and extend ideas from recent work on certified programming and<br/>proof-carrying code, develop new methodologies for verifying runtime<br/>code generation, linking, and mutation, and show how to scale our<br/>approach to real-world system applications.  Successful research on<br/>certifying general RCM constructs will remove a critical (yet<br/>bug-prone) piece of software from the trusted computing base in many<br/>of today's mission-critical systems. The machine-checkable<br/>specifications and proofs will make it easier to understand and<br/>maintain existing RCM implementations and to adapt them to satisfy<br/>particular needs of sophisticated application software.  The PI will<br/>also develop new instructional material for certified RCM constructs<br/>and provide tutorial training to the general public.<br/><br/><br/>     <br/>

Examples include remote surgery, physical manipulation of nano-structures, autonomous (ground and air) vehicular travel, and space and terrestrial exploration.  Because such applications interact directly with the physical world, it is imperative their physical safety be assured.  This project is developing a comprehensive formal framework for producing controllers for cyber-physical systems, with machine checkable proofs of their physical safety.  The project brings together ideas from control theory, language design, program verification, program generation, software engineering, and real-time and embedded systems to build a framework that can be applied to challenging applications.  The framework promotes an efficient, rigorous engineering process for producing embedded controllers, incorporating explicit models not only of the controller itself, but also of the physical context in which it operates, the required stability conditions, the platform on which it will run, and the associated real-time constraints.  The results of the project are being demonstrated and evaluated in the context of a tele-surgery application.  This application is currently being developed at the Mechatronics and Haptic Interfaces Lab in the Mechanical Engineering Department at Rice University.

OFDM has its unique strength in handling high-rate transmissions over long dispersive channels and has prevailed in recent broadband wireless radio applications.  However, underwater acoustic channels are far more challenging than their radio counterparts due to their large bandwidth-to-carrier-frequency ratio, large propagation delay, large multipath spread, and fast channel variations.  Incorporating the unique characteristics of underwater acoustic channels, our first task is to make OFDM work in underwater environments with fast-moving platforms.  Preliminary experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed approach even when the relative speed between the transmitter and the receiver is up to 10 knots, which is the current state of the art.  In our second task, we equip the multi-carrier modem with precise-ranging capability.  The key is to develop precise synchronization algorithms that can locate the first arrival in the presence of dense multi-path conditions and that can work well in fast-varying underwater channels.  In our third task, we develop a standalone modem prototype based on a digital signal processor that integrates the transceiver algorithms developed in this project.<br/><br/>Broader Impact:  Providing a multi-carrier acoustic modem with ranging capability, this project has the potential to directly benefit the development of underwater wireless sensor networks for a variety of applications.  Due to the large bandwidth-to-carrier-frequency ratio of underwater acoustic channels, the proposed methodology and algorithms may, also, have an impact on wideband and ultra-wideband radio applications.  This project integrates research and education to enhance the content of undergraduate and graduate classes and, in particular, provides innovative senior design projects.<br/>

Instruments to be acquired include: 1) a gas chromatograph with both a quadrupole mass analyzer and flame ionization detection (GC/MS-FID); 2) a GC with high temperature pyrolysis attachment; 3) a GC coupled with a preparative fraction collector; and 4) a high performance liquid chromatograph- time of flight mass spectrometer (TOF-LC/MS).  The instruments will be housed in a centralized facility with a dedicated technician.  The equipment will allow for detailed structural analysis and non-destructive collection of a broad range of natural and experimental organic compounds for subsequent compound-specific radiocarbon dating, metal-ligand complex analysis, and stable isotopic analysis for development of novel proxy temperature records in the geologic record.  Five PIs and their graduate students with research interests spanning atmospheric chemistry, the global carbon cycle through time, development of environmental proxies from modern isotopic compositions of algal and terrestrial organic compounds, trace metal complexation, diagenetic pathways of organic matter, biogeochemistry, and molecular geomicrobiology will benefit from these advanced capabilities.

Information derived from our knowledge of the human genome is also relevant to many of the behavioral and social sciences.  One area of particular relevance to archaeology, historical demography, linguistics, anthropology, forensic anthropology, and ethnic studies, among others, is the gene frequency variation that exists among human populations.  Gene frequency variation among current populations is the net genetic effect of all of the factors in the history of those populations: relative endogamy versus exogamy, past and present population sizes, length of time relatively endogamous, origins, selection, etc.  Knowledge of the existing genetic similarities among populations provides relevant information to all of the research domains trying to understand the role of any of those factors.  <br/>ALFRED (the ALlele FREquency Database, <http://alfred.med.yale.edu/alfred/index.asp>) is the only centralized location for information on gene frequency variation for the DNA polymorphisms detected in the bulk of the human genome.  This project will further develop ALFRED to serve as a resource for the anthropological genetics field and the other social science areas noted above.  Intensive curation of data for ALFRED will continue with the entry of gene frequency data for multiple genetic loci (both functional genes and anonymous loci) and multiple populations.  Each frequency will have detailed descriptions/definitions of both the polymorphic site studied with protocols used as well as the specific sample of the specific population studied.  The molecular definition of the polymorphism at the DNA sequence level will be linked to the molecular databases and the description of the population (name, language, location, etc.) will be linked to at least one ethnographic database.<br/>The enhanced database will serve many functions.  It will be an educational resource at both the undergraduate and graduate levels.  It will be an inter-disciplinary research resource providing reference gene frequencies for comparison with new data.  It will provide impetus to focus future data collection efforts in diverse labs on those genetic markers that early studies suggest will provide the best information on specific research questions.  It will provide entree to the genetics/genomics world via specific social/cultural variables such as language, geographic location, population size, etc.  Conversely, it will provide links to relevant ethnologic and historical data on populations that anthropological geneticists need in order to interpret the gene frequency data they collect.  As a bridge between the genomics databases and the relevant behavioral and social sciences the database will provide infrastructure to the increasingly interdisciplinary nature of modern research.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:  ALFRED is already a resource used internationally; increasing the contents and accessibility of the data will only increase its value.  It is a unique resource that makes otherwise inaccessible data readily available to users from a variety of different fields.  The proposed efforts to enhance the educational utility of the database will provide a unique resource for teaching/learning about normal human genetic variation and how that variation is distributed around the world, thereby illuminating our biological history as a species.  It is also our belief that understanding normal genetic variation is one of the surest ways to prevent racist misuse of genetic data. <br/><br/>

There is a rapidly growing interest in extending these techniques from atoms to molecules, whose more complex internal structure opens a wealth of new possible applications. In this project, new instrumentation will be developed to measure and manipulate the quantum states of molecules in novel ways. The primary approach is to enhance the interaction of polar molecules with microwaves, by using an unusual type of resonant cavity. Two similar systems will be designed and built specifically for integration into two ongoing experiments in the P.I.'s lab. One will be used to measure an effect motivated by high-energy particle physics, and the other to enable a technique for cooling molecules to unprecedented low temperatures.<br/><br/>The project will involve extensive student training. The instrument development will comprise the early years of Ph.D. research for two graduate students. These students will be guided by the P.I. and by senior Ph.D. students in the group that have played key roles in the conceptual development and initial prototyping of the systems. The related experiments have typically involved 1-2 postdoctoral researchers and 4-6 graduate students; the next generation of these young researchers will benefit directly from the proposed work.<br/><br/>

In order to tailor properties of nanomaterials and their interfaces with polymers and biological macromolecules, the existing research efforts on the Rensselaer campus for the synthesis and processing of new materials will be greatly enhanced by having access to the much-needed chemical and vibrational spectroscopy information pertaining to local morphology with 10 - 100 nm resolution available from the requested system.  By combining the power of surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy and scanning probe microscopy for the characterization of nanostructured materials on a single in-situ characterization platform, the proposed confocal Raman-AFM instrument will enhance our understanding on the nanoscale domains and interfaces in nanomaterials to promote unique opportunities of designing novel nanomaterials for nano- and bio-technology applications.  <br/><br/>Non-technical abstract<br/><br/>Material researchers working at the frontiers of nanotechnology and biotechnology applications need to have both chemical and structural information in small-size (i.e. nanoscale) domains that are million times smaller than the size of a human hair.   A unique aspect of materials research for nanotechnology and biotechnology is the highly pronounced ratio of surface area to volume present in many materials with nanoscale heterogeneous structures (i.e. nanomaterials), which not only opens doors to developing new surface/interface-based science and technology, but also demands understanding of material properties at the interfaces and on the surfaces.  A nondestructive and high-resolution analysis is now possible to characterize both chemical composition and surface/interface structure in the nanoscale region by measuring the change in the color of the incident light beam and imaging the small region of nanomaterials using a sharp-tip probe at the same time.  This is very much like listening to a song from an old-fashioned gramophone player using a sharp-tip and a compact disk player using a laser light at the same time.  Such unique tool will provide invaluable information for the advancement of materials research particularly to tailor the properties of nanomaterials at their interfaces with polymers and proteins.<br/>

Large deviation theory enables us to explore the first-order but global asymptotic properties of econometric methods and provides a different viewpoint from the conventional econometric theory, which mainly focuses on local asymptotic properties. The project introduces the large deviation approach to three decision problems for moment condition models: parameter estimation and testing, set inference, and moment selection.<br/><br/>The main purpose of this project is to find large deviation optimal econometric methods when existing methods are indistinguishable under the conventional econometric theory (parameter estimation and testing problems) or there is no available framework to evaluate econometric methods (set inference, and moment selection problems). As a broader impact, applications of those optimal methods to empirical economic analysis, such as analysis on returns to schooling and income dynamics, are beneficial for society by providing some new insights on policy studies.<br/>

There are three themes:  (1) Information transmission and coding theory, (2) Rational surface modeling and implicitization, and (3) Approximation theory and multidimensional splines.  The main goal of the project is to bring the full power of abstract machinery to bear on these themes; frequently the key to solving an applied problem is to view it from a different perspective.  For example, in past work, the PI has used spectral sequences and local cohomology to study splines; in coding theory the PI has used toric geometry and Cayley-Bacharach theory to obtain good bounds on certain codes obtained from algebraic geometry. The coding theory portion of the project will focus on finding optimal codes from toric varieties of dimension three or more; on the spline front the PI will investigate splines on polyhedral complexes, as well as the efficacy of the Groebner basis algorithm as a symbolic algebra front end for spline computations. Finally, an exciting new interaction between computer science (specifically, computer vision and animation) and algebra involves rational surface modeling: if a map is defined from the plane to three-space by three rational functions, what is the (unique) polynomial vanishing on the image? Here there is again a fruitful interplay with commutative algebra; the most efficient way to determine the polynomial involves syzygies (relations among the functions which define the map); the aim is to obtain fast algorithms to determine the polynomial vanishing on the image.<br/><br/>One of the fundamental problems in information theory is that of signal transmission; applications range from CD systems to space communication. In a perfect world, the signal sent from point A and the signal which arrives at point B are identical. In the real world, the medium over which the signal is transmitted is not perfect (there is noise), and so errors are introduced into the signal. In signal processing jargon, the transmitted signal consists of code words, and the study of how to clean up the signal is called ``coding theory''. So the problem is simple: how does one catch the errors? The solution is to introduce some additional information into the transmission, so that the receiver at point B can strip off the errors and recover the original signal. It turns out that codes which are obtained from certain geometric objects can sometimes be optimal (that is, not too much redundant information needs to be added). One aim of this proposal is to discover more such codes. A second theme of the proposal involves computer vision and animation. Given a surface and a point in space, the goal is to decide if the point lies on the surface (this arises, for example, in plotting the image of a character in an animated movie). This is easy to do if the surface is given by an equation f(x,y,z)=0 and the point p=(a,b,c); simply check if f(a,b,c)=0. The goal is to find efficient algorithms to determine f(x,y,z), which is typically unknown. The final theme of the proposal is to study ``splines'', which are objects used by companies like Boeing to model surfaces.  The PI will work to determine theoretical bounds on the number of splines on certain objects and will also analyze the complexity of a symbolic algebra algorithm (not currently used in the area) for computing splines. Accomplishing either of these goals could lead to an actual speed up in the software used to generate splines.

The students in the cohorts are being supported through expanded student recruitment, learning communities, faculty and peer mentoring, field experiences, career explorations, financial scholarship incentives, and a systemic change in mathematics instruction. The mathematics instruction is being improved campus-wide through the development of the Math Emporium as a mathematics laboratory where students work with mathematics faculty and student tutors to enrich their educational experiences in developmental and other math courses. The Math Emporium serves the needs of the student cohorts by providing access to online interactive support as well as enhanced faculty/student interactions.

In spite of the critical nature of this problem, we currently lack the necessary conceptual models to predict the impact of eutrophication on estuarine ecosystems. This is particularly true for shallow estuaries, where complex benthic processes often drive overall system function. Benthic invertebrates play an important role in biogeochemical cycling in estuarine sediments, particularly of carbon and nitrogen. However, these same invertebrate species also tend to disappear with the onset of the persistent hypoxia associated with eutrophication. In this research, an early career, female scientist at Rochester Institute of Technology, a RUI institution, will test the fundamental premise that benthic organisms are not simply the subjects of eutrophication, but can also exert strong controls on its progression in shallow estuaries. To this end, she will combine field studies with laboratory experiments designed to examine the reciprocal interactions between benthic community structure, sediment biogeochemistry and micro- and macroalgal growth in West Falmouth Harbor (WFH), a shallow estuary on Cape Cod that is currently undergoing accelerated nitrogen loading. Specific objectives are to: (1) determine the distribution and abundance of benthic fauna across an eutrophication gradient; (2) determine the impact of faunal diversity and functional group on sediment biogeochemical processes, particularly those related to organic carbon and ntirogen removal; (3) determine the feedbacks between faunal diversity and functional group, microalgal growth and macroalgal growth and persistence, (4) evaluate the feasibility and accuracy of scaling from microcosms to ecosystems and (5) integrate results with ongoing research efforts from an NSF funded Biocomplexity award so that the role of invertebrates is included in an overall mechanistic understanding of eutrophication in shallow estuaries and in ongoing efforts to create a spatially explicit ecosystem model of WFH that can be applied to eutrophication of shallow estuaries in general. <br/>A central feature of the broader impacts of the award is that the research will take place at a primarily undergraduate institution and will greatly enhance the local research environment. Undergraduate and Masters students will be provided with multiple opportunities for hands on involvement in large-scale, cutting edge research designed to examine pertinent environmental questions. Research results will be fed directly into modeling efforts that intends to inform managers and policy makers on control of estuarine eutrophication<br/>

Moreover, the integration of RFID into CSN could play an important role for elder healthcare because RFID could be used to monitor elders' medicine taking behaviors. On the other hand, the disclosure of RFID information during RFID tag-to-reader communications can cause the violation of patients' privacy. This research aims to achieve trustworthiness in a practical RFID-assisted CSN platform. This project will make the following three contributions: (1) Error-resistant ECG transmission: A trustworthy CSN should be able to overcome the impacts of radio interference and propagation distortions that can lead to frequent ECG transmission errors. This research will use the receiver-only local ECG processing to overcome ECG errors/loss. It will conduct a comparative study of two promising anti-interference methods, Kalman Filter and Tempo-spatial Regression. (2) Low-overhead RFID security: This research will design a lightweight RFID security scheme based on Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) and a mutual authentication scheme. The RFID security will be tested in our current CSN hardware platform. (3) CSN temporal accountability: In ECG sensor applications, all ECG anomaly detections depend on accountable time interval analysis between different ECG signal segments. This research will achieve CSN temporal accountability through the following two technical approaches: i) design a receiver-only clock uncertainty prediction model to avoid wireless communication overhead; and ii) design a history-aware, reputation based trust model to capture the evolutionary timing attacks.

Research programs at the CCRG will focus primarily on gravitational physics and astrophysics: modeling and simulation of gravitational wave sources involving compact objects, such as black-hole binaries, theoretical predictions of gravitational wave signals, evolution of star clusters and active galactic nuclei containing supermassive black holes, and galaxy mergers.  The computer cluster will be the main computational platform for the gravitational wave research at the CCRG, and will therefore play a critical role in the successful development and completion of the Center's research programs.  The research enabled by the computer cluster will contribute to the success of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO), since it will be used primarily for the numerical relativityresearch (e.g. numerical modeling and simulation of gravitational wave sources) needed to produce the gravitational waveform templates to be used in the analysis of LIGO's data.  This research will build upon the RIT group's  previous breakthrough in binary black hole simulation leading to the technique of Emoving punctures' that now has become the most popular method to evolve black-hole binaries (and recently neutron stars) on supercomputers.  In order to continue the development of this technique, and to increase the number of its astrophysical applications, a new dedicated cluster with new high-speed intercommunication technology is required.  While this computer cluster will be used predominantly for numerical relativity research, other researchers and students at RIT will also benefit from it and from the research opportunities that the cluster will create at the CCRG.

This finding provides a framework to exploit the unique properties of artificial materials and their application towards creating hybrid radio-frequency (RF) and optical devices that require less power to operate than devices currently in existence.  Efforts entail the realization of bulk and planar degenerate band-edge crystal via fabrication in multilayer and multi-tone ceramics, development of non-invasive dielectric electro-optic probes to extract the extraordinary internal electric-field within the crystal, and creation of low power hybrid RF/optical devices by integrating electro-optic material into crystals which exploit the gigantic transmission band-edge resonance.  Low power RF/optical devices benefit a broad range of applications spanning modulators in optical communications networks, phase shifters in phased array radars, detection elements in hybrid RF/optical sensors, and mixers in RF-Over-Fiber systems.<br/><br/>BROADER SOCIETAL AND EDUCATIONAL IMPACT<br/>It is well-recognized that artificial materials will play a crucial role in developing next generation communication systems and sensors.  Technological challenges include the realization of greater bandwidth (optics) and greater mobility (RF) with the concurrent need for increased power efficiency (energy conservation).  The gigantic transmission band-edge resonance to be harnessed herewith is an essential key in creating a new class of hybrid RF/optical devices that operate at significantly reduced power to benefit telecommunications, computing, diagnostics, and sensors.  Research activities and educational goals will be integrated by developing a new RF/optics curriculum at The Ohio State University. Our goals are to (1) engender hybrid and integrative research thinking, (2) encourage interdisciplinary graduate education, (3) involve undergraduates, underrepresented groups and minorities in research, (4) engage industry and promote economic development.<br/>

These plants are best known as the source of tropical passionfruit, but are also widely cultivated for their beautiful, complex flowers. Passionflowers appear to be a recently-evolved lineage that has experienced rapid species diversification. Many species are poorly understood with regard to morphology, geographical distribution, and conservation status, especially in the largest lineage of passionflowers, subgenus Decaloba, with 235+ species. This study will synthesize modern and traditional approaches to address these problems, using DNA sequence data, scanning electron microscopy, and observation of fresh and preserved specimens. Field work will enable collection of fresh material and documentation of species distributions. This project will yield a revision of all species in Decaloba, and will provide a modern evolutionary framework within which to address questions about the evolution of floral shape, pollination syndromes, floral development, and the biogeographical history of the lineage. <br/><br/>This study will address important biological and evolutionary questions in an especially charismatic group of plants. Undergraduate and graduate students will participate in the research. Undergraduates at Keene State College and Harris-Stowe State University, institutions that primarily enroll underrepresented groups in the sciences, will especially benefit from involvement in this study. Summer workshops at Rancho Santa Ana Botanic Garden will involve students from the local community. Field expeditions will build international collaborations among U.S. scientists and colleagues in Mexico, Central America, and South America. All results of this project will be available through a website hosted by the Missouri Botanical Garden. <br/> <br/> <br/>

Traditionally, debates over the gait of the earliest human ancestors (hominins) have centered on the interpretation of lower limb structure. The methods used to date have proved to be inconclusive, especially regarding the functional implications of the structure of the forefoot.  This problem is further compounded by a lack of data on how the forefoot function during gait in living humans and great apes (hominids), and how differences in function relate to foot structure.<br/><br/>The proposed dissertation research will quantify the three-dimensional trabecular (spongy) bone structure at the 1st-3rd metatarsophalangeal joints (MTPJ) and measure MTPJ angles (kinematics) and respective plantar pressures (kinetics) in living hominids in order to test hypotheses about the locomotor regimes of fossil hominins.  Trabecular bone is highly responsive to mechanical demand during life and therefore offers a new approach to test hypotheses that have long remained unresolved about joint function in fossils. Forefoot kinematics and kinetics will be documented for chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), bonobos (Pan paniscus), and humans at key points during the gait cycle. This study will determine whether trabecular bone structure can differentiate species by joint postures and loading regimes.  This approach will then be used to assess whether early hominins possessed a modern human-like toe-off mechanism. The overarching goals of this research are to help resolve current debates about early hominin locomotor regimes and provide a better understanding of the evolution of hominin and modern human bipedalism.<br/><br/>The proposed research has several broad impacts.  First, the results of this project will be relevant to all vertebrate morphologists studying form and function relationships.  This project will also encourage interdisciplinary research by allowing a female doctoral student to be trained in techniques of physical anthropology and biomechanics under the guidance of both American and Belgian scientists.<br/>

The current project is focused on refining, expanding, and testing these education innovations on a wider audience of faculty and students across the United States. It is also implementing the new materials, and in the process, creating diverse and portable modules for student projects and undergraduate research. More precisely, the project is developing faculty expertise by conducting workshops at the PI home institutions and at national meetings to train faculty to teach the course at their home institutions. Also, the PIs are recruiting participants from these workshops to develop project modules to be used by students as end of term projects or in undergraduate research. Moreover, the PIs are institutionalizing the course at their schools and are providing assistance to other interested institutions. The PIs are managing the development of a growing and self-sustaining network of faculty educators who teach and institutionalize the course, develop modules, and participate in the assessment of the role of the course in the curriculum.<br/><br/>

Underwater acoustic sensor networks (UWA-SNs) are envisioned to enable applications for environmental monitoring of physical and chemical/biological indicators, tactical surveillance, disaster prevention, undersea exploration, and assisted navigation, etc.   The major tasks under exploration include UWA-SN self-organization and deployment, self-reconfiguring (MAC, physical layer, and cross-layer design), and mission-aware waveform design/diversity with applications to target recognition, target tracking, and event detection. The AMUSE project is motivated by and targets to solve the following challenges: 1) the sensors in UWA-SN are expensive and mobile, therefore sound self-organization and self-deployment algorithms are needed; 2) waveform design and diversity for UWA-SNs with active sonars are still in its infancy; 3) the transmit and receive data rates are highly asymmetric, which requires new MAC layer design; 4) the underwater channel is impaired by fading, multipath, and doppler shift; 5) the GPS receivers do not work properly in underwater, thus new localization/navigation algorithms are required.<br/><br/>The success of the AMUSE project is able to benefit the two areas of urgent national interests: (1) Instrumentation for monitoring/prediction of natural ocean disasters including storm surges, hurricanes, tsunami, etc. (2) Harbor environments and security. In addition, this project can serve as a vehicle to promote cross-disciplinary graduate and undergraduate research and education, and to encourage the participation of under-represented and female students.<br/><br/><br/>

Box 1346	Gloucester Point	VA	230621346	8046847000	GEO	1670	1389, EGCH	$0.00	Atmospheric deposition has long been recognized as an important source of allochthonous nitrogen, various trace elements, and specific organic compounds to the oceans. However, at present the magnitude and forms of total atmospheric organic carbon (OC) inputs to the oceans are essentially unknown. One reason for this is that air-sea gas exchange of OC has only recently been recognized as a potential source of global significance, with organic gas deposition estimates exceeding both dry and wet atmospheric deposition and riverine fluxes of OC to the oceans. Large atmospheric inputs of biologically reactive OC may also be sufficient to account for the observed net heterotrophic activity of the subtropical northeast Atlantic and other remote marine systems. Thus, would be reasonable to assert that air-sea gas deposition may be an important source of OC to ocean reservoirs and reactive organic matter pools. Moreover, the contribution of anthropogenic emissions of organic gases to the present-day atmosphere may represent a significant influx of pre-aged OC to the oceans.<br/><br/>In this project, researchers at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science will develop and validate robust methods for measuring three operationally defined OC pools in air and dissolved in seawater, so that the air-sea gas fluxes for each OC pool can be quantitatively determined.  The working hypothesis is that gas deposition of organic carbon to the oceans is more than an order of magnitude higher than wet and dry atmospheric deposition fluxes, and that atmospheric inputs are similar in magnitude to, and may exceed, riverine inputs of organic carbon to the oceans. Calculations of air-sea mass transfer coefficients demonstrate that it is critical to distinguish gaseous OC according to its air-water partitioning properties in order to accurately quantify air-sea gas fluxes of this diverse pool of exchangeable OC. To this end, techniques will be developed to separately evaluate volatile, semi-volatile and water-soluble volatile OC in air and surface waters. Bulk OC measurements will be supplemented with gas/liquid chromatography analysis to evaluate the distribution of OC in each operationally defined phase, and to identify specific organic compounds or compound classes where possible. Preliminary sampling and OC gas flux estimates will also be conducted in estuarine, coastal, and open ocean waters of the northwestern Atlantic Ocean.<br/><br/>In terms of broader impacts, the project will include education and community outreach, and will help formulate a more complete understanding of how human activity may be modifying OC inventories in the ocean. Graduate, undergraduate and high school students, including members of under-represented groups, will be recruited to work on this project through several ongoing educational programs at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science (VIMS) in which both of the PIs participate. Community outreach will be achieved through participation in hands-on activities, lectures, and displays at VIMS Marine Science Day, an annual event, which was attended by 1800 people in 2006 (52/48% children/adults). The proposed study will also contribute to ongoing national and international ocean carbon flux programs, including the Bermuda Time Series (BATS), the Ocean Flux Program (OFP), and the Surface Ocean ? Lower Atmosphere Study (SOLAS).  <br/>

Unlike mouse embryos, in which mammalian development has been conventionally studied, the opossum embryo is much larger, implants long after organogenesis has begun, but is born in a comparatively undeveloped state.  Like other marsupial embryos, those of the opossum contain yolk, possess extracellular investments, require the zona pellucida for blastocyst formation, and form a yolk-sac placenta.  Dr. Cruz will investigate how marsupial embryos undergo axis formation, blastulation, and gastrulation to obtain information regarding the morphogenetic and evolutionary differences and similarities between the embryos of marsupial and so-called placental mammals.  She will take advantage of the recent sequencing of the opossum genome to identify genes with conserved or novel functions in mammalian embryogenesis.  In addition, the PI has a second objective: the research training of undergraduate students in biological research, an activity in which Oberlin College has traditionally excelled since its founding in 1833.  The twin goals of the proposed study are 1) to sharpen and expand our knowledge of mammalian evolution in general and developmental biology in particular and 2) ensure that the acquisition of scientific knowledge by students is imbued with the joy of discovery made possible only by hands-on involvement.

The approach is to implement hetero-nanocrystals as floating gate. The concept of using hetero-nanocrystals for nonvolatile memory applications will be theoretically simulated by establishing physical models of solving the Poisson equation with quantum mechanical considerations; prototype novel self-aligned silicide/silicon and metal/silicon hetero-nanocrystal memories will be fabricated and tested; scalability of hetero-nanocrystal memories beyond the 45nm technology node will be proved. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit:<br/>The project will add to the core knowledge of the technologically important material systems of silicon, metal and silicide. The study of hetero-nanocrystals will enrich the state-of-the-art knowledge on nanostructures and help discover more principles of the bottom-up nanofabrication technique: self-assembly. The incorporation of hetero-nanocrystals into metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor memories will also enrich the knowledge of nanoelectronic devices, particularly nonvolatile memories.  <br/><br/>Broader Impacts:<br/>The project involves curriculum activities that will help the Electrical Engineering department of UCR to develop an education specialization area with emphasis on experimental nanotechnology components.

The research plan is designed to accomplish three objectives.  First, the electronic structure and dynamics of singlet excitons in molecular crystal materials as a function of monomer structure and morphology will be determined, utilizing temperature-dependent time- and wavelength-resolved fluorescence. Second, the dynamics of other types of longer-lived excited states, specifically triplets and excimers, will be investigated in molecular crystal materials.  Third, a two-photon standing wave approach will be developed to measure directly the effective exciton diffusion length in crystalline materials in standard solar cell geometries.  The photophysical understanding obtained in the first two objectives is expected to form the basis of the interpretation of how photocurrent generation depends on excitation position within organic thin films.  <br/><br/>This research project is designed to improve our understanding of energy transport processes in conjugated organic materials.  This understanding in turn could aid in the design of improved materials for solar cells, and thus address an important societal problem: the need for clean, inexpensive, and renewable energy. Graduate students and postdoctoral associates will be trained in technologically vital areas.  As well, a hands-on light/solar energy demonstration will be developed and implemented with students at a local middle school in Riverside.<br/>

We focus on the problem of pose and illumination invariant object recognition in video, based on learned models of lighting, motion and shape. We also develop novel scene relighting methods using the illumination models learned from natural videos. The proposed research proceeds by first developing a mathematical framework that relates the appearance of a video sequence with the lighting conditions, motion of the objects being imaged, and their shape and surface properties. Thereafter, it addresses the inverse problem of recognition from video.  The overall mathematical approach is to combine precise geometrical models with statistical data analysis tools, thus combining accuracy and robustness.<br/><br/>This research will benefit a large number of existing applications and create new ones that rely on efficient object tracking under changing environmental conditions. They include applications in national priority areas like homeland security, monitoring of nuclear installations and border security, in commercial interests like video communications, multimedia databases and entertainment, in social causes like wildlife and environmental monitoring, and in medical and biological applications relying on video analysis. Scene relighting by learning the motion and illumination of objects from natural videos will also have a significant impact in creation of realistic virtual environments.<br/><br/>Progress on this project will be regularly updated at http://www.ee.ucr.edu/~amitrc/JMIS.htm<br/><br/>

Alternatively, stereopsis and binocular eye movements could be stimulated in sensory-motor regions of the brain by binocular disparities between perceived directions of the two ocular images (head-centric disparity).  These perceived directions result from a combination of retinal image location and eye position information.  Under normal viewing conditions, retinal disparities are indistinguishable from headcentric disparities, so it is not possible to determine which stereoscopic vision is based on.  However, the two forms of disparity do have different magnitudes when a briefly flashed target is presented with a small interocular time delay near the onset of a rapid eye-movement (saccade).  The saccade causes unequal distortions of perceived direction by the two eyes, and these differences produce stereo-depth.  This is the first evidence that eye movements can influence binocular disparity stimuli for stereopsis and that binocular disparity is represented in headcentric coordinates.<br/><br/>With support of the National Science Foundation, Dr. Schor will investigate how rapid (saccadic) eye movements produce distortions of stereoscopic-depth perception.  These depth distortions reveal how the brain represents binocular disparities that stimulate stereopsis and binocular eye movements.  In addition to improving our basic understanding of stereopsis, this work has implications concerning how eye movements might influence the accuracy of depth stimulated by computer-simulated stereo displays that present alternate frames to each of the two eyes.  The resulting distortions of space could influence performance in depth localization and aiming tasks.

Prof. Cheng and his students will develop novel lipid microarrays and combine them with surface plasmon resonance (SPR) imaging microscopy to investigate lipid-protein interactions in a real-time and label-free fashion. Current methods for the study of lipid-protein interactions are limited in their ability to capture lipid components in a membrane environment.  Most methods are not capable of high throughput analysis. This has become a bottleneck in the profiling of lipid-protein interactions.   To fabricate lipid microarrays Prof. Cheng and his students will coat gold surfaces, commonly used for SPR imaging, with ultra thin silica coatings.  The study will focus on the fabrication of microarray templates with lithographic approaches and calcinated SPR chips, fabrication of robust, artificial membrane microarrays with fluid nature that provide true membrane environment for hosting lipid receptors, and investigation of phosphoinositide-protein interactions with lipid microarray/SPR technique. Since the interactions between proteins and phosphoinositides are essential to the regulation of nuclear functions and membrane trafficking, the work will provide new tools and thus facilitate research in the areas of cancer and type II diabetes. The high-throughput capability of the proposed system will also offer excellent opportunities for the screening of interaction partners that are of therapeutic significance. The project will provide excellent training opportunities to graduate and undergraduate students in a cutting edge highly multidisciplinary area of research.<br/>

LAP controls tomato defenses after wounding and insect feeding. When LAP protein is reduced in transgenic LapA-SI plants, the proteins and chemicals that antagonize insect growth are produced at lower levels. LapA-SI plants incur more damage and tobacco hornworms are larger relative to insects from wild-type plants. In addition, on plants that make excessive amounts of LAP-A protein (LapA-OX), caterpillars consume less foliage and larval masses are reduced. The LapA-OX plants provide an important and new mechanism of insect resistance, since plant stature and fertility are not impaired. Understanding how LAP-A controls tomato defenses will be an important addition to our general knowledge of gene regulation in plants.<br/> Goal 1 is to determine the susceptibility or resistance of LapA-SI and LapA-OX plants to insects that use different modes of feeding. If LapA-OX plants provide resistance to many insect species, an important and new mechanism to protect plants from insect pests will have been discovered.  Goal 2 is to use genetic, biochemical and plant transformation technologies to determine if the peptidase activity of LAP-A is essential for its role in controlling defenses against insects. This is important since LAPs from other organisms have multiple functions. Finally, Goal 3 is to determine the cellular process that is regulated by LAP-A. A new model that links the many signals that influence wounding in tomato and LAP-A is proposed. This model will be rigorously tested using molecular, biochemical and transgenic plant strategies. By supporting or refuting this model, these experiments will aide in defining the complex and largely unexplored defense network that plants employ against insects.  <br/> These studies should result in new strategies for engineering an environmentally safe resistance to insects into crops and horticultural plants, benefiting agriculture and society at large. The proposed experiments range from whole organism studies to molecular responses and spans the fields of plant biology and entomology. This research program will provide a unique, interdisciplinary training environment for a graduate and undergraduate students and a postdoctoral fellow. <br/><br/>
0719911	Collaborative Research:     Comparative Geochemistry of the Late Cambrian (SPICE) and Toarcian (Jurassic) Positive Carbon Isotope Excursions:   New Perspectives on Paleozoic OAEs	EAR	GLOBAL CHANGE, GEOBIOLOGY & LOW TEMP GEOCHEM	09/01/2007	08/10/2007	Timothy Lyons	CA	University of California-Riverside	Standard Grant	Enriqueta Barrera	08/31/2010	$164,803.00		timothy.lyons@ucr.edu	Research & Economic Development	RIVERSIDE	CA	925210217	9518275535	GEO	1577, 7295	0000, 1304, 4444, 7295, EGCH, OTHR	$0.00	The Paleozoic record is punctuated by multiple, large positive carbon isotope excursions that are expressed regionally if not globally. In younger records, similar excursions are often linked through direct observation to ocean-scale events of enhanced organic carbon burial--typically under well-characterized anoxic conditions. In older sequences, lacking preserved deep seafloor, the nature of oceanic redox on the broad scale can only be surmised through use of geochemical proxies that are typically ground-truthed in younger settings. In particular, our work and that of other researchers has illuminated the great potential of the molybdenum isotope proxy for quantifying global deep-ocean redox, when applied with careful consideration to local oxygen conditions and the basinal Mo inventory. <br/><br/>In this study we expand the concept of an Oceanic Anoxic Event--first defined for episodes of pervasive deep-ocean and epicontinental black shale deposition during the Mesozoic--to address the nature of ocean-scale redox in the Paleozoic. We focus on the Late Cambrian SPICE event (Steptoean Positive Carbon Isotope Excursion), suggested by our preliminary C and S isotope data from shelf carbonates and our geochemical box model to be a prime candidate for an early Paleozoic OAE. The Alum black shale in Sweden shows clear signs of the SPICE excursion in the organic C fraction and evidence for at least local euxinia before, during, and after the event--making it an ideal candidate for Mo isotope analysis. A central goal, then, is to extrapolate the OAE concept to the Paleozoic, which has numerous positive C isotope excursions of varying global expression but little physical evidence for conditions in the deep ocean. We will specifically test whether the SPICE is an OAE. Strongly analogous patterns of C and S isotope behavior, black shale geochemistry, and biotic extinction have been described from the better-known Toarcian event. We therefore seek to compare the shale geochemistry and supporting carbonate proxies for seawater composition for these two intervals to ask: 1) Do Mo isotope records from the Upper Cambrian Alum Shale in Sweden point to the globally expanded anoxia inferred from our high-resolution delta13C and delta34S carbonate data from the United States? 2) Do the SPICE and Toarcian C isotope excursions show analogous Mo isotope and C-S-Fe-trace metal behavior, such that significant new light is shed on the nature of the Cambrian event? 3) Do organic biomarker patterns associated with the SPICE match those observed from the Toarcian OAE, suggesting that euxinia shallowed as its areal extent increased? 4)By analogy, can we extrapolate models for the Toarcian to understand invertebrate extinction patterns in the early Paleozoic, including problematic trilobite extinctions? 5)Using our integrated data for the SPICE as a template, are Paleozoic intervals of pronounced positive delta13C and epicontinental black shale deposition analogous to the OAEs of the Mesozoic? <br/>All of these questions will be addressed through collaboration with experts on each time interval and through use of the geochemical proxies that are staples in our combined research groups--specifically Fe speciation, trace metal chemistry (emphasizing Mo), and novel isotope approaches for S, Fe, and Mo.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts. In a sincere effort to extend the impact of this study beyond the Lyons/Anbar research groups, we have designed a two-pronged approach for outreach in the greater Riverside-LA area. First, Lyons/Anbar/Gill will participate during each of the project years in the UCR Mentoring Summer Research Internship Program, whereby students from ethnic groups historically underrepresented in the sciences (particularly the earth sciences) will receive hands-on experience in the two labs. Second, Lyons/Anbar/Gill will work with the Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach, CA, to design an exhibit centered on the global epidemic of anthropogenic coastal hypoxia. Happily, the LA area has seen an improvement in its coastal water quality in recent years. Building from this success and lessons learned from the past--including the very deep past--we expect to reach out to the public about the health of coastal environments in an informative, optimistic, and hopefully entertaining way. Given the 1.3 million annual visitors to the aquarium, we are certain our message will spread widely.

The objective of this project is to consider the problem of jamming in a holistic way and design a framework towards coping with these attacks. The framework will unify the functionalities of deterring, detecting, and alleviating the effects of jamming. <br/><br/>Unlike previous efforts this research will (a) exploit physical layer capabilities such as the tunability of power/rate and the use of smart antennas to cope with jamming and (b) design solutions that are based on strong experimental foundation. Furthermore, the design will seek to address jamming attacks by not only external adversaries but also internally compromised nodes that send large volumes of seemingly legitimate data. The project will encompass the following tasks: (i) Extensive experiments to understand the impact of jamming and identification of behavioral traits during a jamming attack. (ii) Design of methods to obfuscate traffic patterns such that the jammer will be unable to target important nodes or locations in the network (iii) Use of the experimental knowhow in the design of the framework for detecting jamming attacks and (iv) Exploiting physical layer capabilities such as rate/power and smart antennas to cope with attacks. <br/><br/>This research is expected to broadly impact successful future deployments of vehicular and municipal ad hoc/mesh networks. It will also be tightly knit with educational programs that will augment wireless teaching laboratories and introduce cross-disciplinary courses that bridge the physical and higher layers.

During the Neoproterozoic, body fossils and molecular biomarkers interpreted as being derived from multicellular animals have been reported although the radiation of basal animals is presently poorly constrained at sometime between the Sturtian and Marinoan glaciations. In this study, we aim to produce detailed temporal records of Neoproterozoic marine biogeochemistry from molecular biomarker analyses, organic and inorganic stable isotope records (including 13C, 2H and 34S) and from inorganic geochemical proxies of paleoredox for four sections in the Nanhua Basin in South China. This will allow us to investigate the effects of low-latitude Neoproterozoic glaciation on primary production, carbon cycling and redox structure applied to a shallow shelf-to-deep basinal paleoenvironmental transect. <br/><br/>Given the scientific interest in fossilized animal fauna and other fossils from the Doushantuo Formation in South China, it may seem surprising that no detailed molecular biomarker records currently exist for the Neoproterozic in South China. This is undoubtedly due to the high thermal maturity of some sections and due to the inherent problems of discerning low concentrations of genuine Neoproterozic biomarker signals above a significant background of petroleum-derived contaminants. A scoping study has revealed that the thermal maturity of strata in our four sections in Nanhua Basin is not problematic for preserving detectable biomarker hydrocarbon signals. The originality and principal strength of the biomarker lipid work proposed here lies in obtaining kerogen-bound biomarker records which allow us to access a high proportion of the preserved biomarker record in Nanhua Basin essentially free from contamination effects. The PI's research has demonstrated the efficacy of a continuous flow catalytic hydropyrolysis (HyPy) technique for fragmenting kerogen and releasing covalently-bound biomarker constituents to essentially ground-truth all the biomarker lipid data obtained. <br/><br/>We will address some fundamental questions regarding the biogeochemical history of the Neoproterozoic in South China: <br/>-Can we detect significant changes in marine redox structure in the immediate aftermath of the Sturtian and Marinon glaciations using our inorganic and biomarker proxies and, if so, is there strong evidence for concomitant fluctuations in source organism input? <br/>-Can we discern significantly different responses of shallow- versus deep-water settings to the aftermath of the glaciations in terms of their redox profiles and biota? <br/>-Can we detect specific steroid markers for basal animals (sponges) in the Nanhua Basin and, if so, when do these first appear relative to the Sturtian and Marinoan glaciations? <br/><br/>Broader Impacts. The research will significantly improve our understanding of the extent to which the intense climatic shock of the Sturtian and Marinoan glaciations impacted on marine microbial communities by modifying nutrient cycling, dissolved oxygen availability and creating environmental niches in low latitude marine environments. In terms of providing educational opportunities, Love and Lyons will participate during each of the project years in the UCR Mentoring Summer Research Internship Program, whereby undergraduate students from ethnic groups historically underrepresented in the sciences (particularly the earth sciences) will receive hands-on experience in the two labs. Finally, our project will benefit greatly from collaboration with Professor Xuelei Chu (Institute of Geology and Geophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences) and his research group, who have considerable experience of studying Neoproterozoic glacial strata in South China. Chu and colleagues will visit the Southern California biogeochemical community at Caltech and UCR during the course of the project to discuss findings and to promote long-term collaborative links.<br/>

In support of this experience, memory researchers have known for over 100 years that the long-term retention of study material can be greatly enhanced when study sessions are spaced out over time, rather than concentrated into one grueling cram session.  Despite the robustness and importance of this spacing effect, there is currently no widely accepted explanation for it in terms of memory theories, and the breadth of the effect in terms of different kinds of study material has not been thoroughly investigated.<br/><br/>With support of the National Science Foundation, Dr. Pashler and Dr. Mozer are conducting a series of memory experiments to examine relations between inter-study intervals and retention intervals in the context of a variety of declarative memory tasks (i.e., fact learning) as well as procedural memory tasks (i.e., skill learning).  The experiments are motivated by three distinct classes of memory theories that make different predictions regarding the performance outcomes.  The investigators are implementing computational models of the theories to derive their quantitative predictions, and to explore their underlying theoretical principles.  The knowledge to be gained from this research project may be used to improve learning and education in many academic domains, including science and engineering.<br/>

In the context of designing a new kind of low-emissions vehicle, for instance, a designer might reach an impasse in trying to figure out how to optimally position the fuel tank, given the many other constraints on vehicle design that must also be satisfied.  Impasses in problem-solving can occur when the problem solver is fixated on a single representation of the problem space.  Such impasses can be overcome only if one steps back and changes how the problem space is represented. <br/><br/>With support of the National Science Foundation, Drs. Cagan and Kotovsky are investigating cognitive and technological factors that influence how problem spaces in the domain of engineering design are represented, and how such representations can be changed in the face of an impasse.  Their work promises to advance our understanding of how people overcome significant hurdles in creative problem solving -- how people find the ''aha'' that helps them solve difficult design problems that lead to new innovations.  The project consists of laboratory work to collect experimental data on problem solving under impasse conditions, coupled with agent-based computational models of core cognitive processes involved in problem solving.  An important goal of these research activities is to create knowledge that can be used in the classroom and workplace to more effectively stimulate human creativity, and provide a platform for computer design tools that advise and support the innovation process.

College Station	TX	778454645	9798477635	CSE	7364	7364, 9216, 9251, HPCC	$0.00	Given a collection of organisms (or taxa), the objective of a phylogenetic analysis is to produce an evolutionary tree describing the genealogical relationships between the taxa. Inferring a phylogenetic tree that represents a good hypothesis of the truth is a difficult problem. Phylogenetic heuristics attempt to search a very small fraction of the exponentially-sized tree space for good approximations of the true evolutionary tree. The overall goal of the proposed research project is to develop information-rich methods for analyzing the large collection of trees encountered during a phylogenetic search. A better understanding of search behavior can drive the design of better heuristics, which ultimately lead to more accurate reconstructions of phylogenetic trees. Specific research objectives include: (i) developing a search history repository that contains all of the trees examined by a phylogenetic heuristic; (ii) designing algorithms for exploiting informative patterns in a search history repository; and (iii) developing visualization tools that provide informative views of the data residing in the repository.  The novel data analysis and visualization techniques developed for this research project will complement existing NSF-funded efforts to build phylogenies such as The Tree of Life, the evolutionary history of all known organisms. Moreover, the proposed work will provide mentoring and interdisciplinary training to a diverse group of students.<br/><br/>

The methods and techniques will be combined into the remote-access SNe Ia computational pipeline, which comprises sophisticated 3D simulation algorithms for fluid dynamics, nucleosynthesis, and radiation transport, as well as tools for the 3D analysis of SNe Ia data.  SNe Ia are crucial for identifying the nature of dark energy, one of the most important problems facing modern science, because they serve as one of the most direct and precise distance indicators in the Universe.  The results of this study will improve the cosmological calibration of these critical tools, by trying to understand what affects their status as standard candles, notably the different types of progenitor systems, deviations from spherical symmetry, and interaction with circumstellar matter.  One important outcome will be a comprehensive set of observationally verified first-principles multidimensional explosion models of SNe Ia.  Identifying physical correlations among predicted and observed signatures of SNe Ia will be crucial for improving the accuracy of their calibration.<br/><br/>This work is an exceptional platform for introducing students to cross-disciplinary and multi-field science, through the many areas involved in studying SNe Ia, such as numerical methods, large-scale hydrodynamics and radiation transport simulations, observations, and cosmological applications.  Research results will be made available to the broad scientific community via the developed computational pipeline, and will be disseminated to the wider non-technical audience.  The results will also benefit current and future ground- and space-based observing programs.

This new research direction in merging earth science and paleoanthropology will involve obtaining sediment drill core samples from lake beds located on-land, close to areas of critical importance for understanding human evolution. Their efforts will be focused around critical time intervals for human origins during the last 3.5 million years. In this first phase of research, they will obtain critical site-survey and subsurface data for four key localities in Kenya and Ethiopia, essential to the success of a future drilling program, to be funded by a later proposal. They also request partial funding for a drilling workshop, to consider the technical and scientific opportunities and challenges posed by each of the sites under consideration.<br/><br/>Prior researchers have asked the key question of why evolution of humans and their close relatives displays a pulsed pattern, with well-defined periods of extensive speciation or extinction, cultural change and geographic expansion, interspersed with long periods when relatively little change seems to occur. Is this the result of broad forcing effects of either directional environmental change (climate, etc.), the result of changes in the variability of local or regional environments, or some yet-unrecognized mechanism.  These efforts have proceeded either by correlating broad-scale patterns of human evolutionary patterns with the global beat of climate variability as recorded in the continuous records of deep-sea sediment cores or, by correlating regional shifts in the fossil and archaeological record with more local patterns of environmental change, inferred from outcrop records of ancient soils, lake beds and non-hominin fossils. PIs argue for a new research direction linking the earth science and anthropology communities in addressing this central question about human origins, combining the strengths of both of the approaches above, and avoiding some of their inherent weaknesses. Their plan promotes a concerted effort to obtain drill core records from near-continuous sedimentary sequences located close to areas of critical importance for understanding hominin evolution, focused around critical time intervals for their key question above. Drill cores will provide a record that will vastly improve understanding of environmental history in the places and times where various species of our near-relatives lived. Obtaining such records from on land will provide a more detailed and resolved record than what we can currently infer from deep sea core records. Finally, because the largest number of critical events in man's evolutionary history occurred in Africa, such a drilling campaign should start in that continent.  <br/><br/>Few scientific questions can be more central to humanity than understanding where we have come from as a species, and how our environment has shaped our biological and technological evolution.  Results from this proposal will pave the way for a new direction for helping researchers address these questions and will foster a new avenue for earth science/anthropology collaborations. <br/><br/>This international drilling program has important science training opportunities for involving early-career American and African scientists in all aspects of the project. Several students will be involved in the seismic site survey exercises leading up to the workshop, and some students who are likely to join the program in post-graduate work would be able to attend the workshop.

Cities simultaneously are being urged to adopt market-oriented models for infrastructure and service provision, including those involving private sector participation and cost recovery.  In India, 63 cities are currently signing up for major infrastructure loans, and in return, must undertake a host of such reforms.  An essential element of urban governance reforms in India involves such strategies and technological innovations as e-governance, the design of performance indicators, and public budgetary disclosure -- the technologies of good governance.  Very little empirical research has probed the implications of these new governance strategies, many of which have been initiated by and are controlled by powerful citizen-led coalitions, for equitable and just development.  This doctoral dissertation research project will explore the effects through four case studies of technologies of governance in Bangalore, one of India's most rapidly growing cities.  The doctoral candidate will examine these effects along three dimensions:  interest group representation, distribution of basic services, and urban citizenship.  In-depth interviews with international lenders, municipal agencies, and civil society groups will uncover how such organizations conceptualize good governance and how they perceive their roles in improving the city's services.  Spatial mapping of basic services like drinking water access in Bangalore will provide evidence for how equitably targeted urban governance strategies currently are.  Participant observation in a cross-section of neighborhoods will provide insights into how far these efforts have penetrated as well as their effects on existing political and civic spaces.  Project findings are expected to.<br/><br/>This project acknowledges that there are high stakes associated with claims of good governance, a concept that has become commonplace as a policy prescription in the developing world.  Nowhere are these stakes greater than in contemporary globalizing metropolises.  While development funding historically has been tied to structural adjustment, urban infrastructure loans now are conditional on civil society participation, public accountability, managerial efficiency, and other attractive discourses of governance.  This project will assess whether the proposed urban reforms and associated strategies in Bangalore are actually benefiting those most in need of basic municipal services like water, sanitation, drainage, roads, and street lighting.  Given the recent launch of a national urban renewal mission emphasizing the use of technologies of governance and market-oriented reform in India, this research is particularly timely and has the potential to encourage other cities in India and other nations to exercise caution while embracing sanctioned approaches to urban governance reform.  As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.<br/><br/>

Understanding the relationships between different environments and species traits is a fundamental goal of ecology. It is also vitally important for developing realistic models to predict ecological impacts from global change. Despite the critical role of plant roots in carbon and nitrogen cycles, belowground portions of plants have remained a particularly understudied area of research. <br/>The location of roots in the soil matrix and the complex interactions they form pose methodological and ecological challenges. First, roots are difficult to study because of the challenges of accessing them without damaging them. Second, almost all woody plants form complex symbioses between their roots and fungi to absorb nutrients from soil. More information is needed on the variability of root characteristics and how these characteristics shift when interacting with fungi to predict the effects of global change on these interactions. Third, a better understanding of root characteristics and their interactions with fungi is needed in an evolutionary context. The earliest fossils of roots indicate that these roots formed associations with fungi. In the vegetation that exists today, roots are diverse and one facet of this diversity is their degree of dependency on fungi for acquiring soil resources. <br/>In this two-year project, root-fungal interactions will be characterized. Multiple sources of variation in root tissues will be characterized: variation among co-existing species in a forest, between different forests within a single region (Northeastern US temperate region), among regions of different climates (temperate and tropical), and among diverse species due to their evolutionary relationships. This sampling strategy will be implemented in two field seasons in two sets of woody plants: (1) mature trees at two Northeast U.S. experimental forests and (2) living collections of woody taxa at Barnard College and at two New York botanical gardens. These sampling methods and strategies will be shared with international collaborators working in China and Costa Rica and compilation of a large data set of root traits from the literature and from ongoing sampling efforts can thus be initiated. <br/>Broader Impacts. This work will be of interest to applied ecologists addressing how mycorrhizal interactions contribute to invasive plant species or attempting to restore woody vegetation in highly disturbed soils. It takes advantages of experimental forests and of living collections maintained at Barnard College and at botanical gardens in New York City. It builds relationships internationally, initially with scientists in China and Costa Rica. The work also provides important training, mentoring, and professional development opportunities for female forest ecologists and undergraduate women, including underrepresented minorities.<br/>

In order to have a meaningful security management strategy, one has to balance the risk of opening an access and the benefit of having the access. This is extremely difficult for a large system. All sizable organizations depend upon networked computers to provide essential services. One service may depend upon another, which may not be on the same computer. A seemingly legitimate configuration setting at one machine could cause unexpected security exposure at another. A seemingly moderate security control at one service could be too draconian for another service to operate smoothly. In determining a good configuration setting for an enterprise system, one has to consider all possible interactions among the system's components to ensure that accesses are opened in a way that usability and risk are well balanced. <br/><br/>This research will develop a logic-based methodology to automate enterprise security management. The formal model-based approach makes sure that security knowledge can be shared in a machine-readable format, and consumed by automated tools to assist in reaching configuration settings that both satisfy legitimate business needs and protect the information systems adequately. The successful result from the research will enable management workforce to leverage an open management knowledge base, and be liberated from the mundane management jobs by tools that can automatically apply the generic knowledge to specific situations in an organization to reach a secure and usable configuration setting.<br/><br/>

This project will develop logical and computational methods to support both types of activities. Specific components of the project include: the development of formal libraries to support proofs in number theory and discrete geometry; the extraction of verification conditions from software component specifications and implementations in an assertive programming language known as Resolve; a classification of the types of inferences that arise in both domains; the development of logical methods for verifying these inferences automatically; and the development of educational materials and software that will make it possible to integrate these methods into undergraduate and graduate curricula in computer science and mathematics.<br/><br/>As mathematical proofs become more and more intricate, and now often rely on extensive computation, it is becoming increasingly difficult to verify that they are correct. Similarly, as hardware and software systems become more and more complex, it is becoming increasingly difficult to verify that they meet their design specifications. Doing so is especially important when resources, lives, and security depend on their correct behavior. This collaboration between mathematical logicians and computer scientists will develop methods to make it possible to verify that such mathematical and computational claims are valid, and that the arguments supporting them are free of errors. The project will also develop means of training the next generation of computer scientists and mathematicians to use these methods.<br/>

An improvement in a plant''s ability to withstand environmental stress is of fundamental importance, not only for US agriculture, but also in context of the emerging problem of global warming. Plants must optimize growth under nutritional limitations and stress to complete their life cycles. The Target of Rapamycin (TOR) kinase system is considered to be a central regulator of stress and nutritional signals in higher organisms. How these signals are prioritized and integrated to control protein synthesis (translation) and gene expression (transcription) is not well understood in any organism. Recent research in the PI''s laboratory has identified all major components of this pathway in plants and has demonstrated that an osmotic stress signal is controlled by this pathway via phosphorylation of one of the ribosomal proteins that controls protein synthesis. In addition, preliminary evidence indicates that plant hormones may also affect the TOR kinase pathway, thus providing a new approach for understanding how growth is regulated under stress. The goal of this newly funded research is to find a molecular link between the regulation of translation and transcription (particularly, ribosomal RNA) machineries in plants undergoing stress and thus provide insights into how plants acclimatize and adapt to a given environment. During the course of this research, graduate and undergraduate students will be trained and international collaborations will be forged.

The first branch is basal defense, which is induced in response to widely conserved pathogen-associated patterns. The second branch is plant cell-death associated resistance, which is induced by interactions between genes that are variably expressed in both plants and pathogens. Although these branches had long been considered distinct, studies on the RIN4 protein from the model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana, have demonstrated a mechanistic link. Specifically, RIN4 is a regulator of both branches of the plant immune system. This project includes study of how RIN4 modification by phosphorylation regulates its function and how RIN4-interacting proteins mediate activity of RIN4. These studies will significantly advance understanding of how each branch functions in Arabidopsis. More importantly, the relationship between the two branches will be elucidated, which will advance understanding of the evolution and function of the immune systems of all plants. By understanding how these two branches work together to resist nearly all infections, strategies for disease control can be developed in those cases where the plant immune system fails. Furthermore, because similar linkages are just being discovered to exist between branches of the innate immune system of animals, this work in plants will continue to lead advancement across the field of immunology.<br/><br/>The results of this work will be presented at meetings and published in peer-reviewed journals. The implications of this work to agriculture are obvious. The PI has a proven record of working with under-represented minorities, including undergraduate students, doctoral students, and post-docs. Also, the investigator is a leader in establishing the summer undergraduate research experience (SURE) program to provide internships for undergraduates considering careers in science.

While the applications are diverse, the range of loadings that a structure made up of nanocomposites will be subjected to is quite complex. Researchers at Tuskegee University's Center for Advanced Materials (T-CAM) have successfully utilized nanotechnology and are able to produce new types of structural composites through the support from NSF-CREST, -IEGRT, PREM, EPSCoR, ARO, AFRL, and ONR. Most of the work done to date is in the characterization of materials under uni-axial loading at room temperature under static conditions. The existing facilities at T-CAM are inadequate to carry out testing under multi-axial loading conditions. No data is currently available on the characterization of nanocomposite materials under combined torsion-axial loading conditions and also when exposed to different environmental conditions. Such data will be extremely useful to the designers in designing structural components and also in developing accurate life prediction models. The thrust of this proposal is, therefore, primarily directed towards acquiring a new biaxial material testing system (MTS) with an environmental chamber to enhance the current research capability and facilitate the execution of on-going research activities in the area of nanocomposites. Acquisition of the system will benefit a large number of African American students from undergraduate to Ph.D. level in science and engineering disciplines. <br/><br/>Abstract (Non-Technical)<br/><br/>The Center for Advanced Materials (T-CAM) at Tuskegee University is conducting research involving nanotechnology in which nanomaterials which have at least one dimension of the order of thousandth of a human hair size are utilized to enhance the properties of fiber reinforced composite materials through grants founded by National Science Foundation, Federal Labs and industry. These materials when used in airplanes, rockets, cars, and tennis racquets make them stronger at the same time much lighter. However, before they can be utilized with confidence in these applications, they need to be tested under different loading conditions like combined twisting, bending or stretching. Further, these kinds of tests needs to carried out at very low to high temperatures. Through this proposal, we are seeking to purchase a new state of the art material test system that would facilitate these tests. A large number of African-American students from undergraduate to Ph. D level in science and engineering are currently involved with nanotechnology research at T-CAM. Acquisition of this facility will enable these students to have a hand-on experience in the emerging areas of nanotechnology, thereby creating much needed technical work force for the nation that is highly skilled and technically competent.

This project will systematically investigate the differences between these two groups as they observe and classify images of faces with regard to the displayed emotion.  <br/>These perceptual differences may have they roots in the distinct manner in which native users of ASL and non-users code and analyze 2D and 3D motion patterns. We will thus study how these differences relate to the perception of movement. Finally, we will develop a face avatar that can emulate the facial movements of users and non-users of ASL. To achieve this goal, we will develop a set of computer vision algorithms that can be used to study the differences in production of facial expressions of emotions in native users of ASL and non-signers. A necessary step for this is to collect a database of facial expressions of emotions as produced by users of ASL. This will reveal differences at the production level and will allow for the study of perceptual differences.<br/><br/>The research described above addresses several critical issues.  <br/>First, these studies are fundamental to fully understand the underlying mechanisms used by the brain to analyze, code and recognize facial expressions of emotions. While research on facial expressions of emotion has proven extremely challenging to date, most of the studies have only targeted the hearing. This proposal will study the underlying mechanisms associated to code, produce and interpret facial expression of emotions of native users of ASL.  <br/>Unfortunately, the computer vision algorithms necessary to carry out these studies are not available. The research in this project is set to remedy this shortcoming.<br/><br/>The facial analysis studies that will be conducted during the course of this proposal can be used in a large number of applications, for example, from human-computer interaction systems where the computer interprets expressions form its user, and to study the role that each facial feature plays in the grammar of ASL. Furthermore, the study of emotional gestures will be valuable to those anthropologists attempting to understand and model the evolution of emotions, and could be used to develop mechanisms to detect lies and deceit. The database of facial expressions collected during the course this project will be made available to the research community and to educators of ASL. We will open collaborations with the School for the Deaf and encourage deaf students to pursue careers in computing and engineering.<br/><br/>URL:<br/>http://cbcsl.ece.ohio-state.edu/research/<br/>

There is potential to substantially improve the energy efficiency of sensor networks by exploiting cross-layer interactions among various networking layers and functionalities. However, such a cross-layer solution could also become impractically complex and difficult to implement.  To address this challenge, this collaborative NSF-funded project at The Ohio State University and Purdue University aims to develop a suite of high-performance cross-layer mechanisms for sensor networks that are simple, modular, distributed, and provably energy-efficient.  The key distinguishing feature of the project is that the mechanisms developed are based on a solid theoretical foundation that rigorously manages both performance and complexity with the goal of practical implementation.  The PIs will investigate four major functionalities that are crucial to the efficient operation of energy-constrained wireless sensor networks, including joint medium-access and routing, sleep/wake scheduling, in-network aggregation/computation, and reliable broadcast. The theoretical solutions developed in this project will be implemented and evaluated on two testbeds: the existing Kansei testbed at OSU, and a prototype deployment (SENSE@OSU).<br/><br/>Broader impact: The collaborative research will have a significant impact on wireless industry sectors, and will lead to breakthroughs in our understanding of the fundamental limits for developing energy-efficient distributed solutions for sensor networks. The PIs will also continue their current efforts to recruit and train women and under-represented minority groups both at the undergraduate and graduate levels.<br/><br/><br/>

The Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) framework addresses this challenge by describing galaxy bias at the level of virialized dark matter halos, principally via the probability that a halo of a specified mass contains a given number of galaxies of a specified class.  This project includes theoretical and observational investigations that will further develop HOD methods and apply them to measurements from the SDSS.  The theoretical work will reveal the effect of environmental variations on the HOD, such as a systematic dependence of the galaxy content of dark matter halos on the large scale density field.  The observational work is a coherent analysis and interpretation of the final SDSS galaxy redshift survey, drawing on correlation functions, group multiplicities, redshift-space distortions, void probabilities, galaxy-galaxy lensing, group mass determinations, and the large scale galaxy power spectrum.  This analysis will yield HOD determinations of many different classes of galaxies, and cosmological parameter constraints that are tighter and better tested than traditionally obtained.  It will shed new light on galaxy formation, the physics of inflation, the matter content of the Universe, and the nature of dark energy.  The project includes some work on cluster-galaxy lensing as a tool for probing the growth of fluctuations and the evolution of the cosmic distance scale.<br/><br/>The Principal Investigator serves as Spokesperson for the SDSS, responsible for fostering the scientific interaction and productivity of the SDSS collaboration and for promoting the SDSS to the astronomical community and the general public.  This research provides indirect but crucial support to such activities, thus enhancing the scientific return from the SDSS and its role in education and public outreach.  The project also supports graduate student training and the public presentation of astronomy in various forums.

The goal of this work is to develop a new method with the capability to image liquid surfaces using vibrational second-order spectroscopy. While infrared and Raman microscopy are well utilized tools for imaging films on solid surfaces, nonlinear techniques using vibrational difference-frequency (or sum-frequency) microscopy provides markedly greater sensitivity for imaging the air-liquid interface. Currently, sum frequency spectroscopy is used to obtain spectra from liquid surfaces; however, sum-frequency imaging is far from being commonplace mainly because of technical complexity.  Prof. Allen and her students will utilize infrared microscope technology an optical platform for the design of a difference-frequency microscope.  The hypothesis to be tested in this high risk high impact study is that combining a high repetition rate red laser with a continuous wave infrared source, will generate a small number of difference-frequency photons that could be imaged with careful optimization of detection variables. Alternatively, utilizing a high repetition rate infrared source combined with red laser pulses will provide a large number of photons that can more easily be imaged using the infrared microscope platform. This molecularly selective and highly sensitive difference-frequency microscope will have application to imaging in biology, materials, and environmental and atmospheric aerosol research.<br/>

Roscigno <br/>Julia Miller Cantzler <br/>The Ohio State University<br/><br/>This study will examine and compare the historical and contemporary processes through which aboriginal fishing rights have been negotiated in the United States, Australia and New Zealand, where three unique patterns have emerged and persist. This study has two primary aims. The first is to highlight the social mechanisms through which ethnic identity and culture are strategically wielded to resist forces of colonial assimilation.  The second is to reveal the broader processes through which identity-based movements can affect structural changes in the dominant society.  This comparative historical study will be facilitated by the use of event structure analysis (ESA).  With the assistance of the ETHNO software package, temporally sensitive causal narratives will be constructed, which will detail both the specific as well as the abstract and theoretically-driven processes that produced the three divergent patterns of fishing rights.  As demonstrated in recent studies of social movements, ESA permits a deeper, more systematic analysis of the temporality and contingency of events than is typical for historical analyses employing narrative alone.  Interview and archival data will be collected at law libraries, indigenous law centers and indigenous fisheries commissions in Wellington and Auckland (New Zealand), Sydney and Canberra, NSW (Australia), Cairns, Queensland (Australia), Boulder, Colorado, Portland, Oregon and Olympia, Washington.  This project will advance sociological knowledge in several ways. First, the analyses will illuminate more general sociological discourses on the legal construction of race and the nature of racial and ethnic categories and meaning-systems.  Second, the research provides a unique opportunity to expose the dynamic processes through which cultural meaning-systems both affect action and materially impact existing power structures.  Finally, the study will fill a void in the social movement literature by specifically linking conceptions of political process with seemingly dichotomous notions of collective identity and culture. <br/><br/>This study will have on-the-ground, policy implications for indigenous and state actors currently embroiled in struggles for control over natural and cultural resources.  By exposing the evolving power dynamics and structural constraints that shape indigenous-state relations in these three national contexts, this study will reveal the contextual opportunities and obstacles for policy-level resolutions of conflicts over indigenous fishing rights, as well as other sovereignty-based claims of aboriginal people.  It is hoped that this information will help dismantle the barriers that inhibit the achievement of mutually satisfactory resolutions of these ongoing disputes.      <br/><br/>

In order to understand fully what molecules reveal about the objects in which they reside, it is necessary to comprehend how the molecules are formed and destroyed.  To this end Dr. Herbst has created large networks of chemical reactions, including both gas-phase and grain-surface processes. Coupled with physical models of sources, either homogeneous or heterogeneous, these chemical networks allow the modeler to calculate molecular abundances, both in the gas and on the surfaces of dust grains. Successful comparison with observational data then gives information on physical conditions and lifetimes of sources. The research builds on earlier work from this laboratory, and is mainly concerned with the process of star formation, which proceeds through a variety of different manifestations and stages. Through the study of molecular spectra, as analyzed through the prism of chemical calculations, one can begin to glimpse what is happening to gas and dust as stars form.<br/><br/>Astrochemistry has been instrumental in the burgeoning use of molecules as probes of the interstellar medium in our galaxy and others. Much of the knowledge of diffuse and dense interstellar clouds, and especially star and planetary formation, now comes from an understanding of what molecules in these regions are telling us. The field of molecular astronomy has become a worldwide endeavor in which observational astronomers, theoretical chemists, experimental scientists, and modelers collaborate on problems of mutual interest.  In addition to working with both students and postdoctoral associates in his research, Dr. Herbst has tried to make the field known both to scientists in other fields and to the lay public by giving large numbers of talks outside of astronomy departments, publishing review articles, giving interviews for magazines and newspapers, and by going to local elementary, middle, and high schools to discuss the molecular universe.  In addition, Dr. Herbst now runs a mini-conference on astrochemistry each June as part of the larger international spectroscopy symposium held in Columbus.

For applications that involve tracking movements at large scale such as tracking of thieves and robbers fleeing with stolen objects, tracking of animals in forests, and tracking the spread of forest fire, using the full coverage model makes sensor deployment prohibitively expensive. No sound model currently exists that can be used for systematic deployment of such large scale applications.<br/><br/>This project proposes a novel model of coverage called Trap Coverage that can be used for systematic deployment of sparse sensor networks, while ensuring frequent tracking of movements of interest. Most existing theoretical and systems work are not applicable to this new model because of the inherent sparsity of the network implied by the trap coverage model. The overall goal of this project is to establish a strong foundation for all large scale movement tracking applications and address the key systems issues faced in such applications. The project applies rigorous mathematical analysis, experimentation on a large scale sensor network testbed, and real-life deployment of a campus-wide object tracking system called AutoWitness to design, develop, and evaluate the algorithms and protocols developed in this project. In addition to providing hands-on research experience to undergraduate and graduate students in building a real wireless sensor network, the AutoWitness system is expected to help reduce property thefts in a university campus.<br/>

In such settings, many existing algorithms may perform poorly or may have high overhead while inefficiently consuming energy. One approach is to utilize mobile sensors in these situations, such as sensors with wheels. However, mobile wheeled sensors may not be able to move to the desired locations in the areas of difficult terrain with obstacles. Wheeled sensors can also be very expensive. A hopping sensor is a type of mobile sensor with a bionic mobility design that is inspired by creatures, such as grasshoppers. These sensors are still at an interesting concept stage. This proposal addresses the design, prototyping, and evaluation of hopping sensors and efficient algorithms for sensor deployment in difficult areas and rugged terrain. We focus on four research issues that are critical to the effective deployment and management of large scale sensor networks in such settings: robust and power-efficient hopping sensors, sensor localization, sensor coverage, and deployment of a self-adaptive all terrain sensor networks equipped with the hopping sensors and the proposed algorithms, which is called LEAPNet. Most future sensor networks are likely to be deployed in our targeted environments, and hence this research will benefit real-world applications such as monitoring ecosystems, disaster relief, and military reconnaissance. Strong collaborative efforts will be made to provide efficient and practical solutions with solid engineering designs and strong algorithmic foundations for this purpose. In addition, an innovative integration of the proposed research and education program will provide students with analytical skills and hands-on experiences by emerging technologies, which will better prepare them for strong technical careers in this rapidly growing and changing area.<br/><br/>

Campbell Rd., AD15	Richardson	TX	750803021	9728832313	MPS	1266, 7552	0000, OTHR	$0.00	This project concerns the study of randomly excited nonlinear dynamical systems with memory.  Such systems represent viable models for predicting the response of mechanical structures when stressed beyond the elastic limit.  A new mathematical approach is considered: stochastic variational inequalities (SVI).  The stochastic process solutions of the underlying SVI are essentially continuous diffusion processes with degeneracies and state constraints, for which governing equations can be formulated to describe the evolution in time of their probability distributions.  Dissipativity of the system can be used to show existence of the corresponding invariant measure.  The uniqueness of this invariant measure and the ergodic property are conjectured to be true for classes of hysteretic systems appearing in applications.  Based on the availability of the probability distribution as the solution of the SVI, many practical issues concerning reliability of structures modeled by hysteretic systems can be answered in a systematic fashion.  Control problems for SVI are also considered, such as finding the lowest energy input excitation (the so-called critical excitation) that drives the system between prescribed initial and final states within a given time span.  Obtaining necessary conditions is a non trivial problem in view of lack of differentiability of the state equations, i.e., optimality conditions are needed for non-smooth dynamical systems.  The use of approximate penalty techniques (to remove the constraints) leads to the consideration of degenerate diffusion processes on infinite domains, with challenging questions concerning ergodicity of the corresponding process.<br/><br/>The nonlinear behavior of mechanical structures subjected to vibrations is a major concern in designing buildings or plants that must resist earthquakes, ocean waves, the wind, and other random excitations.  Many attempts have been made in the past decades, with some successes, in defining universally acceptable safety standards corresponding to potentially occurring environmental loadings.  However, the analysis of the underlying mathematics of models involved in these problems is far from complete.  The accumulated fatigue that explains the ruin of structures is a nonlinear phenomenon with memory.  By providing a thorough understanding of stochastic processes related to the responses of nonlinear systems described by stochastic variational inequalities, this research will establish a solid theoretical foundation for the study of system reliability.<br/>
0732949	SGER:  Is titin a winding filament? A new twist on muscle contraction	IOS	Physiolg Mechansms&Biomechancs	08/15/2007	08/19/2008	Kiisa Nishikawa	AZ	Northern Arizona University	Standard Grant	mary chamberlin	12/31/2008	$83,345.00		kiisa.nishikawa@nau.edu	ARD Building #56, Suite 240	Flagstaff	AZ	860110001	9285230886	BIO	7658	9183, 9237, BIOT	$0.00	 Despite its huge success, the sliding filament theory of muscle contraction has proven insufficient to explain several long-known and important aspects of muscle function, including: 1) enhancement of force with stretch, 2) depression of force with shortening, 3) the low cost of force production during active stretch, and 4) the high thermodynamic efficiency of actively shortening muscle. Efforts to explain these properties have led to numerous alternative hypotheses. Recent studies have suggested that the giant protein titin may function as a spring in active striated muscle. The important question that remains is whether a titin spring might play a direct role in contraction of calcium-activated muscle, and if so, how? <br/>The 'winding filament' model provides a simple and comprehensive mechanism by which titin contributes to muscle contraction. It postulates that titin binds to the thin filament in calcium-activated sarcomeres. Ca2+-dependent binding of titin to the thin filament prevents low-force straightening of titin that normally occurs upon passive stretch of skeletal myofibrils at slack length, and explains differences between cardiac and skeletal muscle in the length-dependence of active force. Because titin is bound to both the thick and thin filaments, rotation of the thin filament by the cross bridges will wind titin upon the thin filament. Winding of titin on the thin filament will store elastic potential energy in unbound titin by increasing its strain and stiffness during isometric force development. The magnitude of changes in strain and stiffness of titin due to thin filament rotation will depend on the winding angle of titin. The elastic energy stored in titin during isometric force development is recovered during active shortening, increasing shortening velocity and power output. The winding filament model has the potential to revolutionize the field of muscle physiology, as well as mathematical and biomechanical models of muscle function, influencing the design of actuators and prostheses, perhaps even artificial hearts.<br/>The goal of the proposed research is to develop and test the hypothesis that winding of titin upon the thin filament contributes to muscle force development and active shortening. That goal will be accomplished via three objectives. (1) Continue experimental work to develop, refine, and test predictions of the model. (2) Collaborate with mechanical engineers to develop self-stabilizing actuators based on the winding filament model. (3) Develop new collaborations to test the winding filament model using nanotechnology, to create mathematical and physical models based on the winding filament concept, and to collaborate with industry to develop and manufacture self-stabilizing actuators for applications in robotics and prosthetics. The broader impacts of this proposal include the development of interdisciplinary collaborations among biologists, mathematicians, mechanical engineers, and industry. The proposed studies have the potential to benefit society by facilitating the development of lightweight actuators with properties that closely resemble those of active muscle, including self-stabilization during perturbations in load. Underrepresented students, especially Hispanic and Native American students, will participate as intellectual partners in the proposed studies. The results of this research will be disseminated to a broad audience by publishing in diverse media and by participating in interdisciplinary conferences in the areas of neuroscience, engineering, and mathematics.<br/>

The languages with the most elaborated systems of clicks are currently endangered, so our chances of understanding the range of these sounds that human languages can accommodate are dwindling.  With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Amanda Miller (Cornell University) and Dr. Bonny Sands (Northern Arizona University) will analyze the physical properties of these complex sounds. A newly-developed ultrasound imaging methodology will greatly enhance our knowledge of the movements of the tongue during these consonants. Current phonetic thinking, as seen in the International Phonetic Alphabet, encompasses five clicks (bilabial, dental, alveolar, palatal and lateral), but preliminary work has revealed that there are an additional three click types: retroflex, palatoalveolar lateral, and forward-released (or denti-alveolar) lateral.  A completely new class of sounds, linguopulmonic consonants, that seem to entail a phonological airstream contour, has also been tentatively identified. The researchers, with assistance from Laurentius Davids of the National Institute for Educational Development in Namibia and Dr. Kemmonye Monaka of the University of Botswana, will study the kinematics of unrecognized clicks and new types of consonants and compare them with the known click types so that the articulatory, acoustic and phonological properties of all clicks will be better understood. Research will focus on 5 click languages: Ekoka !Xung, Grootfontein !Xung, Ju|''hoansi, =/Hoan, and Mangetti Dune !Xung. <br/><br/>Marginal and complex sounds found in African languages must fit into universal models of human language, but they have often been neglected given that existing models have typically been built around European languages and a select range of others. The present research will also aid the development of orthographies for the languages under study. The project will result in an audio and video database of Khoesan language speech acoustics and production that will be transcribed, annotated, placed in a public archive and made available to interested researchers. This database will be a unique source of information on synchronic and diachronic phonological patterns involving clicks (particularly those patterns between vowels made towards the front of the mouth and clicks which involve retraction of the tongue). The description of the physical properties (phonetic) and mental representations (phonology) of unrecognized consonants resulting from this research will allow these rare consonants to shape universal linguistic theories beyond the life of the currently threatened languages.

The first objective is to devise a novel approach to resolve a controversy regarding whether such enhancement is truly due to the intrinsic structural substitution of lithium or iron ions by multivalent metal cations or due to extrinsic impurities formed in the grain-boundary network of the materials. This project is designed to rule out the complicating factors due to grain boundary impurities by (1) synthesizing the cation-doped LiFePO4 in the form of single crystals, which are free of grain boundaries, and (2) synthesizing these materials in the form of very fine and well separated nanowires, for which the continuous grain-boundary network is either broken or cannot be formed. The second objective is to establish a basic understanding of how electrochemical performance and electronic conductivity vary with the size of the nanoparticles of the cation-doped LiFePO4 cathode materials. Such an understanding is currently absent due to the difficulties in making separable nanoparticles with desired sizes. Except material synthesis, the experimental program also includes the study of the transport, electronic structure, and electrochemical/physical properties of the cation-doped LiFePO4 materials. The characterization and property study include electronic conductivity, electrochemical performance (such as cyclic voltammetry, discharge profile, discharge capacity), x-ray absorption spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction, and transmission electron microscopy measurements. <br/><br/>The success of this project will provide a better understanding of the origins of enhancement of the electronic conductivity in cation-doped LiFePO4, which could bring breakthrough in the application of these cathode materials in next generation lithium-ion batteries.  The research will be conducted at a predominantly undergraduate institution, SHSU. This project will provide cutting edge research opportunities to undergraduate students at SHSU for their research training in several fields: electrochemistry, nanoscience, crystallography, and condensed matter physics. <br/><br/>

Adams<br/>MRI Acquisition<br/><br/>At tier-1 research universities, the trend is to build massively parallel clusters of hundreds or thousands of nodes, connected using a low-latency interconnect like Myrinet or Infiniband. These clusters provide excellent performance, but their expense puts them out of reach of the hundreds of small universities, colleges, and community colleges across the U.S. (and world).<br/><br/>By contrast, the Beowulf cluster [1] is a high performance computing platform consisting of a modest number of PCs (usually 48 or less), an inexpensive network (usually TCP/IP), an open source operating system (usually Linux), and parallel programming software (usually MPI). By trading off performance against price, the Beowulf cluster's low price makes it affordable at small universities, colleges and community colleges that cannot afford a large cluster.<br/><br/>This proposal is to build a 32-node Beowulf cluster for multi-disciplinary research and teaching at Calvin College, a non-PhD granting comprehensive college of about 4200 students and 310 faculty. According to NSF data, Calvin is first in the U.S. among baccalaureate and masters granting institutions for producing undergraduates who complete their PhD in computer science.<br/><br/>According to NRC data, Calvin is fourth in the U.S. among such institutions for producing undergraduates who complete science PhDs.

The project builds upon the lessons learned from a previous NSF-funded CSEMS scholarship program. In particular, fewer but larger awards are being given so that efforts can be focused on a small group of students. While fewer students are participating, this approach is improving the chances that any one of these students will succeed.  The course of study includes a demanding curriculum in the major as well as a strong grounding in the liberal arts. This background provides not only disciplinary expertise, but also the critical thinking and communication skills needed to succeed in today's global workplace. A cohort is being established among the students through participation in a first-semester course designed to orient them to college life and the sciences. In subsequent semesters, they are meeting in sessions to talk about science and their research interests with the other STEM scholars and science faculty. Some of the scholarship students are participating in mentored summer research experiences through the Loyola-sponsored Hauber Fellowship program.  Others are taking advantage of internship opportunities coordinated by the college's Internship Coordinator. Throughout their academic careers, these students will be closely monitored and advised by the PI and the CoPIs, with appropriate support services provided. Student success is being carefully tracked in terms of grades, scholarships and awards, and student surveys.

Within the Alutiiq world, the Kodiak Alutiiq dialect is particularly threatened, with fewer than 35 elderly speakers scattered among isolated, rural communities in the Kodiak Archipelago. Although uniquely placed at the southern extent of the Eskimoan language family, Alutiiq is one of the least-studied Alaska Native languages. Alutiiq Living Words is a project headed by Sven D. Haakanson and April Counceller, and it is funded by the National Science Foundation.  Housed at the Alutiiq Museum & Archaeological Repository, this three-year community-based research effort will document rapidly vanishing forms of Kodiak Alutiiq oratory, linguistic knowledge, and place names.  <br/><br/>To document Alutiiq oratory, semi-fluent field researchers (primarily Alutiiq people) will work closely with Kodiak Alutiiq speakers to make digital audio and visual recordings. Efforts will focus on the eldest and most fluent speakers, many of whom are over 80 years old. The recordings will be transcribed and indexed by project staff, transferred to CD and DVD, and archived both at the Alutiiq Museum and the University of Alaska's Alaska Native Language Center (ANLC). In addition to new recordings, selected older recordings from ANLC and the Alutiiq Museum's archives will be digitized, transcribed, and translated. To document and preserve linguistic place name information, research notes taken by Dr. Jeff Leer of ANLC will be verified with modern speakers, and compiled in an interactive multimedia Kodiak Archipelago place-names map for the web site. In addition to contributing place-names data, he will act as the project's Faculty Associate, editing Alutiiq language text and guiding the interpretation of selected oratory. Another objective is to form a New Words Council (NWC) of fluent speakers and semi-fluent project staff, who will develop new words for the language. Modeled after the successful Hawaiian Lexicon Committee, this group will document aspects of Alutiiq language revitalization in practice, as the community advances towards a healthier language status. New words, recordings of these words, and documentation of the word-creation process will be included in the project's online database and disseminated in a printed new words guide.<br/> <br/>

Related to management practices are issues regarding how inmates are supervised, how staff and administrators handle incidents of misconduct, and how inmates perceive the handling of these incidents. From a normative perspective, this last issue might be linked to the odds of subsequent misconduct via inmate (dis)respect toward authority. Using data collected from surveys of inmates and correctional officers, along with official records and administrator interviews, this study examines these processes within and across the 32 adult correctional facilities in Ohio. The findings should contribute to the existing knowledge by developing more properly specified models of inmate behaviors than have previously been offered, with more careful consideration paid to different theoretical perspectives. Some of the broader impacts of the study are (a) to offer a unique and rigorous contribution to the theoretical debate over the relative importance of individual versus environmental effects on inmate behaviors, (b) whether related observations are conditioned by analyses of self-report versus official measures of inmate behavior, (c) to inform correctional practice in Ohio, and (d) to provide results that should be generalizeable to other jurisdictions. <br/><br/>Toward these ends, the researchers will focus on all surveyed inmates from 32 facilities in Ohio and pursue three stages of analysis.  In stage one, they will examine the relative effects of inmate characteristics on their odds of engaging in personal crimes, property crimes, drug crimes, or general rule violations.  Analyses will be conducted to explore whether the effects vary significantly across facilities, what are the relative effects of facility characteristics on misconduct rates across prisons, and what are the effects of inmate characteristics on the odds of misconduct differ across facilities based on differences in particular facility characteristics.  In Stage two, the researchers will examine the relative effects of formal responses to misconduct versus inmate characteristics on inmate perceptions of fairness regarding the processing and sanctioning of their misconduct.  Analyses will be conducted to explore whether the effects vary significantly across facilities, and identify the effects of facility characteristics on levels of inmate (dis)satisfaction with procedures and sanctions for misconduct.  In addition, the reseasrchers will investigate whether inmate effects on their perceptions of fairness in treatment differ across facilities based on differences in particular facility characteristics, and whether racial and/or gender disparities exist in the detection, processing and sanctioning of inmate misconduct exist within Ohio correctional facilities.  Finally, in stage three, the researchers will study the relative effects of formal responses to misconduct versus inmate characteristics on the odds of subsequent self-reported misconduct.  Analyses will be performed to investigate the relative effects of formal responses to misconduct versus inmate characteristics on the odds of subsequent officially detected misconduct.

Students are provided a personally registered remote control that is used to answer conceptual questions during the actual class.  The questions are text-, diagram- or graph-based multiple choice questions that focus on one key concept.  They are intended to reinforce material presented in class. They provide immediate feedback to students as class responses are collected in near-real time and displayed on a graph at the front of the classroom.  Students and instructors analyze the graphs, discuss the results and use that information to guide subsequent activities.  Small group discussion of class responses is the primary mode of instruction.  We are analyzing over 9000 student responses to identify questions that can be used as reliable in-class assessments at other institutions.  Teaching and learning aids are also being developed to help students identify ways to better prepare for class so that they are successful in and out of class.  We are varying the types of questions, amounts of response data students see and questioning techniques to determine which combinations provide the richest learning experiences.  Data are being collected in six different states at community colleges, four-year colleges and research universities.  The intellectual merit of this proposal includes analyses of data regarding the utility of using electronic response system and questions across populations, disciplines and educational settings and identification of better ways to ensure a scientifically literate population of non-science majors. The broader impact of this proposal includes the thorough study and documentation of student response to these questions by gender and ethnicity.  Such documentation is leading to recommendations for how faculty can employ such assessments in the most inclusive way possible.<br/>

The course includes integrating earth history into studies of modern systems, and vice versa. The summer experience will start in Golden, Colorado and then visit sites in and around Yellowstone Hot Springs and also the Green River Formation in W. Wyoming. Students will be seeing unusual sites where energy supplies are rare yet life thrives, where mineralization is actively capturing evidence of biotic and abiotic processes and where modern and fossil biosignatures are present. Following the field trip, course participants will convene for 4-5 days at the Colorado School of Mines to do lab work and learn about molecular biology, cloning and sequence analysis. The group will move to the USC Wrigley lab on Catalina Island. Select samples, collected from the Green River Formation, will be extracted for organic compounds. Students will also have access to petrologic analyses of thin sections (obtained ahead of time) and will use a novel environmental SEM. Student projects will be guided by visiting faculty and a final report/poster/presentation will be assembled. During this time, there will be more lectures from visiting faculty and lab work on projects. Among the instruction that will occur while students are at Catalina will be lessons on thermodynamics and modeling. In total, the 2008 summer course will be three weeks in duration. The student-instructor and student-student interactions are facilitated through a team-oriented, research-based curriculum and by their close interactions during field trips, in the collegial atmosphere of the marine field station on Catalina Island, and across the laboratory bench-top.

The work is focused on determining a quantitative understanding of the specific-ion, or Hofmeister, effect in which a strong dependence on ion type, particularly the anion identity, is seen in salting-out of proteins, basic colloidal interactions, properties of polyelectrolytes, and other related topics. Beck and his coworkers address this problem by performing accurate quantum chemical calculations for interactions between ions and their neighboring solvation shells. The inner shell solvation is then coupled to a continuum or classical molecular dynamics approximation for the outer shell contribution to the free energy. The conceptual link that allows the physical partitioning is the Potential Distribution Theorem (PDT) which allows for exact partitioning of free energy contributions of the various components. The work is having a broader impact on our understanding of biophysical systems, particularly membranes and ion channels.
0716319	Multi-Modal Heaviness Perception	BCS	PERCEPTION, ACTION & COGNITION	09/01/2007	08/14/2007	Kevin Shockley	OH	University of Cincinnati Main Campus	Standard Grant	Betty H. Tuller	08/31/2010	$204,748.00	Michael Riley	kevin.shockley@uc.edu	University Hall, Suite 530	Cincinnati	OH	452210222	5135564358	SBE	7252	0000, OTHR	$0.00	Seemingly the most natural way to gauge an object?s heaviness is to pick it up and move or heft it, thereby engaging the sense of touch.  However, research has shown that what a person sees, in addition to what a person feels, contributes to the perception of an object?s heaviness.  There is something in the way an object appears to move in response to an applied force that is informative about how heavy the object is.  Although heaviness perception was one of the first problems investigated by experimental psychologists, no single theory of human perception currently explains how heaviness perception depends on both the sense of touch and on vision.<br/><br/>With support from the National Science Foundation, Dr. Kevin Shockley and Dr. Michael Riley will conduct research that aims to develop a unified account of certain visual and haptic (touch) influences on perceived heaviness.  The research will test predictions from a model that describes visual and haptic sensitivity to rotational inertia (resistance to rotational acceleration) as the physical basis of multi-modally perceived heaviness. Briefly, as one tries to rotate an object, it resists; it has rotational inertia. Perceived heaviness, in turn, relates to how much rotational acceleration the object demonstrates in response to the applied muscular torque. How might the object?s responsiveness--its rotational acceleration--be known? Can it be known visually, haptically, or both together? To answer this question, the research will employ virtual reality technology, which permits dissociation of the seen motion of a hand-held object from the felt motion.  A visual display depicts a ?virtual object? whose movements are coupled to a physical hand-held object, but the way the virtual object responds to an applied muscular force can be manipulated so the object appears to move in disproportion to its actual movement.  Preliminary research has revealed that if the object is seen to move more or less than it is felt to move, perceivers experience the object as lighter or heavier, respectively.  Additional experiments employing a haptic virtual reality device will test the broader hypothesis that the relation between applied muscular force and the responsiveness of the hand-held object?whether the responsiveness is detected visually, haptically, or multi-modally?underlies heaviness perception.  Identifying the physical basis of heaviness perception may have important practical implications for designing safe and ergonomic hand-held tools and tele-robotic interfaces.<br/>

The use of dynamic channel modulation and signal multiplexing will make it possible to acquire data from a large number of channels without individual detection electronics for each channel. <br/><br/>In addition to the scientific benefits of the instrument, this award will involve students in state-of-the-art microfluidic biosensors. The concept, activities, and results from this research will be incorporated into undergraduate and graduate courses as real-world examples. Students will be recruited also through the university's Undergraduate Research Program, Increasing Diversity in Engineering Academics program and Women in Engineering Program. Middle school students, including those with special learning disabilities, and their teachers will have hands-on experiences with cutting edge BioMEMS technology through summer and Saturday workshops funded by an NSF education grant. A network-based course, ?MEMS: basics & practice?, will be broadcast to the extended community through the university's Distance Learning Network. The state has lost a considerable number of manufacturing jobs to overseas manufacturers in recent years, and the investigators anticipate that this project will help to cultivate a high-tech atmosphere in the region.  <br/>

Applications can be found in coating and cooling problems where liquid films are used to enhance heat or mass transfer, and fluid management in microfluidics devices (for example lithographically induced self-assembly technologies).  Highly viscous flows are considered because inertia is absent in many important applications. The problems are nonlinear and mathematically challenging because they require the simultaneous solution of the equations of fluid mechanics and of the Maxwell equations. Two basic mathematical approaches are developed. The first is a fully nonlinear numerical method based on a  boundary integral equation formulation. This leads to a large system of integral equations which describe the motion and the electric field in each fluid. These equations are coupled by nonlinear boundary conditions and a stable numerical method is derived. The second approach is an asymptotic method based on long wave approximations. It leads to simpler partial differential equations whose range of validity is determined by comparing solutions with those obtained by the first approach. Analysis and computations will be used to solve for the spatio-temporal evolution of electrified coating flows over flat and variable substrates as well as the evolution of microfluidic layers under the action of electric fields in the presence of topographically structured electrodes. Of major interest is the use of electric fields to manipulate the interfacial evolution and possible robust coherent structures such as nonlinear steady- or large-time states.<br/><br/>In the high-tech world of ever decreasing machinery sizes and their components, it is vitally important to be able to construct models and study fundamental aspects of different processes. A mathematical model that can be put on a computer and solved, provides us with a rare opportunity to perform numerical experiments rather than laboratory experiments which can be both time consuming and expensive. The mathematical/computational model becomes an exploratory tool to refine the design of existing processes and at the same time to probe new regimes efficiently. It is important to produce valid mathematical models and resolve them accurately using computers.  The present study develops and studies such models with applications in coating of microelectronic components and the production of micro- and nano-sized structures in microelectronics applications.  Many components are coated with a liquid which solidifies to form the desired surface (e.g. DVD disks).  Any waves that form at the liquid surface and then get inherited in the final product after solidification, produce defects and degrade performance.   This study examines, theoretically, ways to control such features.  It also examines models that describe the formation of nano-sized features on microelectronic devices that can be used to produce micro-chips. The goal is to study and produce a theoretical protocol to control the waves that form during the liquid phase and before solidification.<br/>

This project will implement a new tool for motif discovery using algorithmically efficient alignment methods.  The first thrust of the proposal is based on an extension of the loop model commonly used in RNA structure prediction.  An extended model achieves better efficiency that current algorithms and allows a biologist to annotate conserved regions and incorporate these into the process, thereby obtaining more meaningful results.  The second thrust applies the alignment algorithms to feature selection and motif discovery.  This is an essential step in RNA mining, choosing a set of significant substructure from a set of molecules.  The subset can be used alone or in combination with kernel methods to build new tools for RNA classification and clustering.  The work will be validated and can advance interdisciplinary data mining and develop human resources by training graduate and undergraduate students.  A new undergraduate course will also be developed, and selected materials also used for high school students.

Warchall	07/31/2012	$120,000.00		miura@njit.edu	University Heights	Newark	NJ	071021982	9735965275	MPS	1266	0000, OTHR	$0.00	This project investigates free boundary problems governed by nonlinear partial differential equations where localized heating controls the dynamics of the formation of singularities in surface-tension-driven flows.  Thermal effects can lead to interesting dynamics that are very different from the dynamics in isothermal cases.  The project will investigate the role temperature effects on viscosity and surface tension play in shaping viscous threads.  The problems under study involve nonuniform fluid cylinders and cylindrical tubes with viscosity and/or surface tension that change rapidly with temperature.  To better understand the collapse mechanism of fluid cylinders or tubes, the project studies model problems that describe:  1) pinch off of cylindrical threads; 2) collapse of a cylindrical hole in an infinite medium; 3) collapse of tubes; 4) annealing of tubes, and 5) extensions of these problems with flow.<br/><br/>This project analyzes the effects of temperature on threads of viscous material, which are used in many manufacturing processes.  Thin viscous threads (such ink jets in printing) pinch off into droplets due to the effect of surface tension, which tends to minimize the surface area of the liquid.  Pinch-off phenomena also occur in other applications, e.g., in thin films that arise in coating flows.  Heating can significantly modify surface tension, which leads to thermocapillary effects, in which temperature gradients cause surface tension gradients that drive flows.  Manufacturing processes require glass and polymeric materials to be at high temperatures to deform them, which leads to thermoviscous effects due to due to the resultant large changes in viscosity.  Examples include the pulling of fiber optic cables and formation of glass microelectrodes used in electrophysiology.  In recent years, semiconductor nanoclusters and high-purity nanowires have been produced using various techniques, and heating is normally required in the annealing stage.  In all these processes, heating plays a crucial role in controlling the shape of final products.  This project will contribute to detailed knowledge of the effects of heating on viscosity and surface tension, potentially leading to improved manufacturing processes for these materials.<br/>

Their approach is motivated by the need to identify new active regions that have the potential to produce powerful flares, as well as to understand the nature of photospheric turbulence in ARs. <br/><br/>The PI will also derive observational parameters of the photospheric turbulence inside coronal holes, such as magnetic power spectra, mean flux density, and filling factor.

This technique will characterize new flux emergence and establish the probabilities for active regions to become flare productive. They will implement a solar flare detection and characterization algorithm, including a classification scheme using the SVM, active region growth, and edge enhancement techniques. The algorithm will detect flare ribbon separations and help determine the electric currents in magnetic reconnection regions. The PI will also study a large number of CMEs using a characterization routine to establish the relationship between CME speed and magnetic reconnection rate. This will allow the prediction of CME kinetics based on real- time monitoring of magnetic reconnection. <br/><br/>This effort will enhance our understanding and prediction of processes affecting solar activity and the propagation of resulting solar effects to the Earth via the solar wind.  The work is inherently interdisciplinary, involving cutting-edge solar physics and computer science research.

These patterns emerge in a sequential process, with simple patterns providing inputs to molecular networks, which, in turn, transform these inputs into more complex outputs.  Due to the recent advances in the molecular studies of development, these networks can now be modeled at mechanistic level.  Exploring complex mechanistic models is critically dependent on the use of computational techniques; at the same time, the behavior of large-scale models can often be understood through analysis of simplified models, providing a bridge between computational and real experiments. Rigorous mathematical techniques for analyzing the dynamics of signal processing in developmental patterning are yet to be developed.  To this end, the PIs propose to pursue a number of analytical approaches for studying the spatiotemporal dynamics in patterning networks.  These approaches, which rely heavily on the techniques from the calculus of variations, will be applied in the context of epithelial pattern formation in the Drosophila egg, an established experimental model for studying how simple inputs establish complex spatial patterns in development.  The proposed analytical and computational work will build on the modeling and experimental results obtained by the PIs during the previous funding period.  Within the framework of this application, the PIs will focus on signal processing by two-dimensional patterning networks with positive feedback loops.<br/><br/>The proposed research is closely linked to the experimental work on pattern formation mediated by the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR), a key regulator of epithelial tissues across species.  Given the highly conserved nature of EGFR signaling and the generality of inductive patterning events, the work of the PIs will provide insights into a large class of development problems.  In addition, the mathematical techniques developed in this proposal will be applicable to a wide range of problems modeled by nonlinear parabolic partial differential equations.  This research is strongly aligned with the educational effort of the PIs that involves further development of undergraduate and graduate courses on mathematical biology of cell communication systems and interdisciplinary training of mathematics and engineering graduate and undergraduate students at NJIT and Princeton.

The purpose of this project is to investigate two very important but mostly untouched MANET security issues: user unlocatability and communication anonymity. Without solving them, mobile users can be easily tracked or their communication patterns can be easily gathered for user profiling, which would jeopardize the user privacy and make them vulnerable to pinpoint attacks. In this project, a novel overlay-based approach OverUCA, an anonymous network overlay composed of nodes that anonymously communicate with one another atop the underlying MANET substrate, will be investigated to achieve user unlocatability, source anonymity, destination anonymity, source-destination unlinkability, and full compatibility with existing routing and MAC protocols. The success of this research will have a tremendous impact on advancing the deployments of MANETs in security-critical commercial, civilian, and military applications. This research will provide a viable way to fight against pinpoint attacks, advance the state-of-the-art in the wireless security research, and spark new research activities in securing MANETs.  Moreover, the results from this research will be disseminated widely through high-quality conference and journal publications and public talks. Furthermore, the research outcome will be integrated into the educational curricula across two institutions. Finally, a couple of minority (female) students will work for their Ph.D. degrees, and hence this project will train the minority professionals for the national work force.

This project will develop logical and computational methods to support both types of activities. Specific components of the project include: the development of formal libraries to support proofs in number theory and discrete geometry; the extraction of verification conditions from software component specifications and implementations in an assertive programming language known as Resolve; a classification of the types of inferences that arise in both domains; the development of logical methods for verifying these inferences automatically; and the development of educational materials and software that will make it possible to integrate these methods into undergraduate and graduate curricula in computer science and mathematics.<br/><br/>As mathematical proofs become more and more intricate, and now often rely on extensive computation, it is becoming increasingly difficult to verify that they are correct. Similarly, as hardware and software systems become more and more complex, it is becoming increasingly difficult to verify that they meet their design specifications. Doing so is especially important when resources, lives, and security depend on their correct behavior. This collaboration between mathematical logicians and computer scientists will develop methods to make it possible to verify that such mathematical and computational claims are valid, and that the arguments supporting them are free of errors. The project will also develop means of training the next generation of computer scientists and mathematicians to use these methods.<br/>

Types provide the foundation for the composition of systems from independently reusable components by providing a rich language of invariants governing programs and data.  Verification provides the foundation for reasoning about the run-time behavior of programs, especially their effect on the execution environment.<br/><br/>To integrate these two methods the project is developing new dependent type systems capable of expressing behavioral specifications and new methods for checking conformance with such rich type constraints.  To ensure that the integration is sound, the project is developing its theoretical foundations using mechanized proof assistants.  To assess the practicality of the integration, the project is implementing a programming language that integrates types and verification, and is developing applications that illustrate its use.<br/><br/>The primary intellectual contribution of the project is to investigate the design and implementation of programming languages that support the specification and verification of strong correctness properties of programs.  A broader contribution of the project is to promote through education the use of formal methods to improve the reliability and maintainability of software systems.<br/>
0649865	Collaborative Proposal: Instrumental Development of Microfluidics-Based Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting Device for Research and Education	DBI	INSTRUMENTAT & INSTRUMENT DEVP	09/01/2007	08/09/2007	David Weitz	MA	Harvard University	Standard Grant	Cort L. Anderson	08/31/2010	$378,052.00		weitz@seas.harvard.edu	1033 MASSACHUSETTS AVE	Cambridge	MA	021385369	6174955501	BIO	1108	1108, 9184, BIOT	$0.00	This award is for the development of a microfluidic-based fluorescent-activated cell sorting device (M-FACS).  The M-FACS will combine the single droplet control of microfluidics with the cell screening and sorting of a FACS. If successful, the M-FACS will allow one to encapsulate individual cells, add additional compounds to each cell, incubate these and then sort the results, all at 1000-10,000 cells per second, allowing good statistics to be obtained on a distribution of a population of cells. M-FACS will enable the study of chemicals excreted by cells or presented on their surface. It will likewise enable using individual cells in an assay that screens a large library. This would significantly increase the utility of FACS. One way to encapsulate individual cells within drops is through the use of microfluidic techniques. Individual cells can be suspended in drops in an inert carrier fluid. Moreover, it is also feasible to completely control these drops: they can be combined with other drops, they can be divided into smaller drops, they can be interrogated with optical probes, and they can be sorted with electric fields. This new technology will be supported with essential theoretical work to fully understand the new possibilities that will be available. The M-FACS overcomes one significant limitation of FACS: with FACS, the cells must be sorted as soon as they are encapsulated.  The M-FACS will qualitatively change the applicability of FACS. It will allow using cells as part of an assay, testing them against a library of compounds, and sorting the cells based on the results.  It will allow cell growth to be a criterion of the sorting. This will allow myriad new problems to be investigated. <br/><br/>A desk-top Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting machine with greatly extended capabilities will be of great benefit to the broader scientific community. The machine will be developed by students and post docs, both experimental and theoretical. They will receive training in a field that merges engineering with biology to create novel devices that enable new science. The work will also be disseminated at a workshop that will describe the completed device.  <br/>

Discovery of a dentinal tubule network that runs continuously from the inner pulpal wall through the dentin layer and extending to the outer cementum surface indicate that the tusk may have the ability to sense variables in its external environment.  Such tubules have the capability to enable the detection of changes in pressure, temperature, osmotic or particle gradients and may also possibly enable tactile sensation as well.  Evidence of these open tubules to the surface has not been observed in normal mammalian teeth, except in conditions of pathology and trauma.  The existence of such tubules as a normal condition is extraordinary, especially given the exposure to harsh environmental conditions of cold water and pressure during dives of over 1500 meters.<br/><br/>The study is a unique opportunity to test the overlying hypothesis that the tusk of the male narwhal is capable of sensory function, playing a role in female choice or male competition for reproduction in the species.   The specific hypothesis is that exposing the tusk to water with widely varying salinity will result in changes in brain wave patterns.  Water salinity has been chosen as the primary stimulus as it is relatively easy to control, and relates to one possible environmental stimulus that could be used in the navigation behaviors reported in the literature and by Inuit hunters and elders..  EEG signals will be recorded  under conditions in which the water salinity is varied, and sound recordings from the narwhals will be simultaneously recorded.. Both systems are to be housed in portable, self sustaining, floating laboratory stations. The data will be analyzed to determine if measurable changes in EEG signals or acoustic signals correspond temporally with changes in the salinity of water introduced to the tusk water jacket.   Should the hypothesis that the narwwhal tusk have a sensory function prove to be correct, it will have a broad impact on our understanding of a new sensory system in a unique animal, and the work also should have a positive impact on the public understanding of science.<br/><br/>

This study will further describe the formation, processing and cloud forming properties of natural secondary organic aerosols (SOA) in a pristine setting.  Arising from the photoreaction of vegetative emissions (e.g., isoprene, monoterpenes) and atmospheric oxidants, the size resolved particulate evolution of SOA into larger, cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) potentially serves as a mechanistic link between biological processes and climate through resulting control of precipitation patterns. <br/>Field investigations will take advantage of an existing forest research site, the Large Scale Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia (LBA) tower site located 60km north of Manaus, a city of approximately 2 million and the capital of Amazonas state, Brazil.  The prime experimental strategy will concentrate on the deployment of a high (mass) resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer (HR ToF-AMS) which will allow the atmospheric mass loading, the mass spectra (chemical identification) and the aerodynamic size distribution (35nm to 1.5um) of SOA particles to be observed at high temporal resolution.

People make important decisions about which home to buy, which person to marry, which medical treatment to accept, and so on by estimating the hedonic value that each of these experiences will afford. But in the last decade, research by psychologists and behavioral economists has shown that these estimates are often wrong. That is, people often mispredict the hedonic value of future experiences and thus make suboptimal decisions that they later regret. Why does this happen?<br/><br/>Both the estimated and actual hedonic value of an experience depends on the other experiences to which it is compared. For example, chemotherapy may seem worse when compared with simple surgery than with a debilitating course of radiation. The comparisons people make are of two types. When a person compares an experience with other experiences he or she has had, will have, or could have had (e.g., At least this chemotherapy is not making me feel as bad as the radiation would have), the value of the experience is influenced by differences. But when a person compares an experience with the experience he or she was having in the previous moment(e.g., I am more nauseous than I was a few minutes ago), the value of the experience is influenced by changes.<br/><br/>The researchers suggest that as a general rule, when people are estimating the hedonic value of future experiences they tend to compute differences, but when they are actually having hedonic experiences they tend to compute changes. Because people make different comparisons at these two times, they often mispredict the hedonic value of future experiences. This proposal describes 13 studies that seek to investigate the causes and consequences of this phenomenon.

A primary objective of the SBGrid Research Coordination Network (RCN) is to provide a uniform level of computing grid access and software availability to all structural-biology groups, including those in geographically underrepresented communities and smaller universities. The RCN will consolidate the high-performance computing resources of a large number of participating laboratories and build a bridge between the structural biology and the physical-sciences communities, through federation with Open Science Grid. The award will enhance the capacity of individual laboratories to solve challenging and ambitious structural biology problems, particularly ones that require use of multiple experimental technologies. The network will adapt a number of structural?biology applications to take advantage of grid resources and contemporary hardware technologies. It will encourage development of parallelized, grid-compatible software in affiliated laboratories, and will coordinate their installation, testing, and distribution. In this connection, the RCN will also support short courses in computer programming for structural biologists. By enabling access to a wide array of institutions and investigators, this RCN will have significant broader impacts.

Such fluctuations cause a wide range of human disorders, and many cellular control circuits are best understood in terms of how they tolerate, exploit, or eliminate the threat of randomization. However, studies of noise have been difficult to interpret due to a lack of comprehensive conceptual frameworks. We will extend the existing frameworks in several ways, by: 1) Determining the applicability of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT) to genetic networks with nonlinear rate functions. 2) Extending the FDT to higher moments and better approximations, systematically rewriting mathematical theorems in terms of biological observables. 3) Analyzing how the gradual aging of molecules affect random fluctuations between cells. 4) Evaluating and extending a common approximation where dilution of components in growing cells is modeled by degradation. In all cases, we compare the results with experimental findings for single cells. <br/><br/>Fluctuations in concentrations arise spontaneously in cells due to 'molecular chaos' where individual molecules randomly collide before reacting. This randomness is particularly pronounced at the extremely low levels of many crucial cellular components, where individual chemical events have large relative effects. Many experimental studies have measured the resulting variation, but the results are difficult to interpret because the conventional mathematical frameworks are poorly suited to cells. Using concepts from statistical physics, we will extend previous methods to create a more effective framework to analyze and interpret fluctuations. This will help explore the physical conditions in the cell, and better understand the basis of physiological disorders that result from an incapacity to correct perturbations.

Dedicated motherboard-level regulators increase the form factor of portable electronics.  This project is developing a novel paradigm in which power regulation circuitry is designed synergistically with the computational elements of system, thereby reducing or eliminating the need for off-chip regulation. The focal point of the research is the development of models, design methodologies, and management techniques that allow low power high-performance SoCs to be directly connected to an energy source, enabling the next step in system integration.<br/><br/>The project seeks to develop integrated, programmable, on-chip switching regulators that leverage novel packaging technology to provide noise free supply voltages at high-efficiency. In addition, on-chip regulation improves the feasibility of fine-grained voltage domains.  The project examines unique cross-boundary system optimizations spanning both software-level task management and regulation hardware design.  It is developing integrated operating system and hardware methods to limit peak current, improve slew rate demands, and reduce voltage ripples through balanced scheduling. In special cases, it may be possible to completely remove regulation circuitry and allow the operating system to adapt computation under deregulatedgradually declining battery voltages.<br/><br/>The removal of dedicated off-chip regulation from embedded systems has broad potential for commercial and social impact by enabling new generations of compact, reliable embedded devices, such as consumer electronics and medical devices. This project provides educational benefits through training of graduate students and incorporation of resulting advanced material in courses.<br/>

The next-generation Internet will require an infrastructure that gives more emphasis to self-monitoring and self-measurement from the beginning.  This research focuses on the value of providing a near-ubiquitous, flexible hashing infrastructure that allows approximation schemes for a variety of network measurement and monitoring tasks.  The focus is motivated by the great value of deploying hash-based structures, including their relative simplicity, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness.  <br/><br/>Broader Impact: The goal of such an infrastructure would not only be to handle issues that have already arisen in today's network, but also to provide a general framework for handling additional, currently unknown problems that may arise in the future.  It is anticipated that such an infrastructure will prove sufficiently valuable that it will be made part of the standard architecture for Internet devices.

With funding from the National Science Foundation, Drs. Cavanagh and Pepperberg are investigating visual processing in a Grey parrot named Alex, who can vocally answer many questions at the level of a 4- or 5-year-old human child. The investigators are examining visual attention beginning with basic studies of visual illusions, i.e., stimuli that appear to humans to vary in size but in reality do not. These experiments leverage Alex's ability to vocally report the color of the larger or smaller of two items or reply 'none' if no difference is seen. Such experiments are accompanied by attention tasks in which two targets must be detected in a rapid stream of items. The targets will be the digits 1 through 8 that Alex can recognize. For humans, the second target in such a stream is often lost if it follows the first too closely. This interference from the first target is called the 'attentional blink' and it is a measure of the speed with which attention can switch from one target to the next. Do parrots, which are prey species that must monitor for sequential predator movement and attack, have the same speed of attentional switching as humans? Or will this task reveal differences in cognition between birds and humans? Drs. Cavanagh and Pepperberg are investigating a broad range of visual tasks to determine which attention abilities share the same underlying mechanisms in birds (grey parrots) and humans and which do not. Similarities between these two species, with very different brain sizes, will allow us to understand which components of cognition can be implemented with smaller scale neural architecture. Differences will indicate the components that require greater brain size and/or complexity. The data will guide future comparisons with other species and providing insights into the structure and function of the human brain and for the design of artificial visual processors.

CARS microscopy provides image contrast based on molecular vibrational frequencies, which are intrinsic to small molecules, such as lipids.  CARS microscopy does not require the addition of fluorophores. To image small molecules in cells, higher sensitivity is needed. Higher sensitivity is to be achieved by developing frequency modulated CARS to remove the non-resonant background and increase the sensitivity by one or two orders of magnitude so that small molecules can be probed and mapped as vibrational oscillators at concentrations of approximately 10-100 mM in vivo.<br/><br/>CARS microscopy is a non-invasive technique for 3D imaging of living cells and tissues with chemical selectivity. The sensitivity of the CARS microscope will be increased 10- to 100-fold through the developments with this award.  The principal investigator runs annual CARS microscopy workshops to train new users from around the world.  This award is aimed at pushing the state-of-the-art of bioimaging with the ability to have a point-by-point chemical map in a living organism in noninvasive manner with no staining; and it will open exciting possibilities for biological research.

The instrumentation will support the research programs of faculty at EIU, and programs at Manhattan College, Oakland University, St. Joseph's University, University of Central Missouri, University of North Carolina at Wilmington, University of Tulsa, and Western Illinois University. The primary research that would be supported by the proposed diffractometer falls into four broad categories: i) constrained molecular frameworks, ii) functional materials, iii) supramolecular assemblies and iv) the investigation of synthetic processes.  <br/><br/>X-ray diffractometers are widely used to provide characterization of reaction products and materials.  Often characterization by other means is difficult or ambiguous.  X-ray diffraction patterns provide accurate measurements of the three-dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles, as well as the spatial arrangement of the molecule relative to the neighboring molecules.  The results of these studies contribute to a broad range of areas, including inorganic, organic, organometallic, biological, and materials chemistry.   Eastern Illinois University plans to establish an integrative applied crystallography center open to students and faculty in the greater academic community of small colleges and universities that are supporting undergraduate research activities.   <br/>

This theory deals with<br/>the properties of heterogeneous materials, which are of critical<br/>importance for modern technology.  Modeling of such materials<br/>raises fundamental mathematical questions, primarily in partial<br/>differential equations and Calculus of Variations.  The project<br/>focuses on two areas, with homogenization and multiscale analysis<br/>as their common themes. <br/> Area A.  Ginzburg-Landau models: homogenization, well-posedness,<br/>and near-boundary vortices.  Vortices of the minimizers of the<br/>Ginzburg-Landau energy functional capture essential features of<br/>superconductors and superfluids.  They have many common features<br/>with vortices in fluids, defects in liquid crystals, dislocations<br/>in solids, etc.  The investigator studies the homogenization and<br/>rise of a special type of near-boundary vortex for the<br/>Ginzburg-Landau functional in the class of maps with the degree<br/>(winding number) prescribed on the boundary of a<br/>multiply-connected domain.  In this problem, he establishes novel<br/>local minimizers that have near-boundary vortices with bounded<br/>energy. <br/> Area B.  Homogenization of an elasticity problem with many<br/>nonseparated scales and the Cauchy-Born rule.  Homogenization<br/>(upscaling) in the presence of many nonseparated spatial scales<br/>is far from understood from a mathematical standpoint and it<br/>arises in the study of turbulence, soils, biological tissues,<br/>etc.  The investigator studies such a problem for elasticity<br/>equations and constructs an approximate (upscaled) solution<br/>belonging to a finite-dimensional functional space.  The<br/>classical Cauchy-Born rule is a postulate that allows the passage<br/>from atomistic to continuum models in monoatomic crystals.  The<br/>investigator uses the above approximate solution to derive a<br/>generalized Cauchy-Born rule for strongly heterogeneous<br/>materials. <br/><br/>     The investigator focuses on the development of novel<br/>techniques of applied analysis to address the needs of modern<br/>technology.  The Ginzburg-Landau equations arose in modeling<br/>superconductivity but have wider implications.  In this project,<br/>the investigator's work on this topic has potential applications<br/>in the design of superconducting materials (which at certain<br/>temperatures conduct electric current with no resistance) and<br/>ferromagnetic materials.  Additionally it addresses the<br/>understanding of vortex behavior, which is one of the major<br/>challenges for the science of superconductivity and its<br/>technological applications.  For the second topic, homogenization<br/>of elasticity problems with nonseparated scales, he aims to<br/>develop novel, efficient computational tools suitable for<br/>modeling strongly heterogeneous (disordered) materials, both<br/>natural and man-made.  In particular, the issue of elastic<br/>cloaking, when a portion of a geological medium is shielded<br/>from elastic waves, is addressed.  Advances here could help in<br/>the design of earthquake-proofed buildings.
0653222	The UCNA Experiment: Measuring Angular Correlations in Neutron Decay using Ultracold Neutrons	PHY	NUCLEAR PRECISION MEASUREMENTS	08/15/2007	06/12/2009	Albert Young	NC	North Carolina State University	Continuing grant	Kyungseon Joo	12/31/2010	$630,000.00	Bernard Wehring, Ayman Hawari	albert_young@ncsu.edu	CAMPUS BOX 7514	RALEIGH	NC	276957514	9195152444	MPS	1234	0000, OTHR	$0.00	The UCNA experiment utilizes, for the first time, ultracold neutrons (UCN) to measure the angular correlation between the neutron spin and the electron momentum (the beta-asymmetry) in neutron beta-decay.  A beta-asymmetry measurement, together with a measurement of the lifetime for neutron decay and the lifetime for muon decay, provides enough information for a model-independent extraction of the parameters characterizing semi-leptonic charged current weak interactions in the first generation of quarks.  The proposed measurement can be used to determine Vud, the CKM matrix element important for nuclear beta-decay, and to provide various tests of the electroweak standard model.<br/><br/><br/>UCN are produced in a spallation-driven solid deuterium ultracold neutron source at Los Alamos, directed through a 7 Tesla polarizing magnet and spin-flipper, and then guided into a decay spectrometer.  The spectrometer consists of a decay cell mounted within a uniform,<br/>7 Tesla magnetic field.  Charged particles emitted during the decay spiral around the field lines to detectors, positioned outside the decay volume to intercept all particles emitted during the decay.  The utilization of ultracold neutrons for these measurements, instead of a more traditional cold neutron beam, has certain advantages: the neutrons can be polarized to essentially 100 percent, simply by passing them through a high field region, and backgrounds<br/>can be reduced to extremely low levels compared to those typically found at reactor-based experiments.  In the proposal period we seek to establish a measurement of the beta-asymmetry at the one percent level, and then begin pushing for the ultimate precision achievable with this technique.<br/><br/><br/>The broader impact of our measurement lies in part because of its interest to the physics community at large:  the UCNA experiment determines fundamental parameters in the electroweak standard model and provides a means to identify new physics below the weak interactions scale, a subject of general interest in physics.  We also are in the process of developing UCN technology, which may have applications in diverse other fields, including as<br/>a probe for surface properties relevant to solid state physics, materials science and biophysics.  Finally, our program will result in the training of undergraduate students, graduate students and post-doctoral associates in nuclear physics, neutronics and issues associated with neutron research in general.<br/><br/><br/>

The Principal Investigator at SUNY Fredonia (Michael S. Milligan, Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry) and the Co-Principal Investigator at SUNY Oswego (James J. Pagano, Department of Chemistry and the Environmental Research Center) have successfully collaborated in numerous funded and non-funded research projects over the past ten years that have led to many student co-authored publications and conference abstracts. Both the PI and the Co-PI supervise modern analytical laboratories dedicated to sample extraction, clean-up, and analysis of organic contaminants. Through the acquisition of three gas chromatographs: one with updated and modernized mass selective detection (including electron impact, positive ion chemical ionization, and negative ion chemical ionization sources) and two with electron capture detection capabilities, the PI and Co-PI will further enhance their expertise in the analysis of new and emerging chemical compounds of concern, endocrine system disrupting compounds such as chlorinated dioxins/furans (PCDD/Fs) and co-planar polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and legacy pollutants such as PCBs, polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and organochlorine pesticides found in atmospheric samples, Great Lakes fish, and other environmental media. <br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this project involves the development, advancement, and refinement of trace analytical techniques used for the detection and quantification of organic contaminants. These types of analytical challenges often demand sub-picogram and sub-part per billion (ppb) detection limits, and require sophisticated instrumentation for success. The PI and Co-PI each have over seventeen years of experience in the analysis of the organic species listed above, and are well qualified to advance this field of discovery. These chemical compounds have been designated as persistent bioaccumulative toxics (PBTs), and are believed to possess toxicological properties that are of significant concern to humans and other animal species. Many of these PBTs are hypothesized to be endocrine system <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>disrupting compounds, whose hormonemimicking effects can be manifested at alarmingly low concentrations. Other PBTs are likely present in the environment, but have yet to be identified. Accordingly, developing and perfecting modern analytical techniques to detect, identify, and measure the concentrations of these target compounds at such demanding levels in media such as air and fish tissue is of great importance.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of this project will serve to promote fundamental research and discovery, cross-campus collaborations, improvement of laboratory technology, education of university students, and training of aspiring scientists. Undergraduate and master's level research students will gain valuable field, laboratory, analytical, and interpretive experience while working under the supervision of the PI and Co-PI, leading to post-graduate positions in industry, governmental laboratories, and graduate school. These students will be exposed to state-of-the-art analytical techniques required for trace analytical procedures, and they will take the skills and lessons learned from these experiences with them as they advance in their careers. Students will prepare and present results at scientific conferences. Improved laboratory facilities for the PI and Co-PI will attract many prospective students for the future years, and allow these laboratories to remain competitive in pursuits for extramural funding.<br/><br/><br/>

Typical wireless sensor networks (WSNs) applications that require accurate localization include disaster recovery and independent assisted living applications. Nodal location awareness is clearly necessary because a sensed event should be reported along with where it happened.<br/>Since for the scenario of many WSNs application GPS is not a viable choice, localization protocols have been proposed that provide nodal positions. In particular, it has been observed that the concurrent deployment of inter-nodal range and the angle of arrival (AoA) of the radio signal can be effectively used for localizing nodes with remarkable accuracy. While techniques for measuring the inter-nodal range have been proposed that achieve accurate estimation, determining the AoA is still widely uncharted territory in WSNs. This research will investigate the design of a physically and electrically small, low-power multiple element antenna array that can provide unambiguous AoA for RF signals.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: WSN are an important and growing area, with countless applications most of which relay on accurate localization. Determining accurate AoA with RF techniques is still largely unexplored for WSNs. This research intends to provide results from multiple points of view: From antenna design, to extensive simulations to real-hardware experimentation.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: Providing sensor nodes with the ability to self-localize without relying on infrastructure will improve the response in disaster recovery and in assisted living applications.  The WSN community will also benefit by the investigation proposed here. A graduate student will be supported by this effort.

While techniques such as surface silicon micromachining and bulk silicon etch are used as practical methods for thin microstructures, processes such as LIGA (an acronym for the German words for lithography, electrodeposition, and molding) offer the capability to fabricate high aspect ratio microstructures (HARMs). A drawback of LIGA-based fabrication, however, is the need for repeated synchrotron exposure and development steps, which are both expensive and time-consuming. Commercial viability of the LIGA process requires economical replication technologies to eliminate the repetitive synchrotron exposure and development steps.<br/>INTELLECTUAL MERIT: Responding to the above-mentioned need, proposed is a collaborative investigation with Sandia National Laboratories on a new technique for rapid replication of electroforming micromolds with integral microscreens. The process is based on injection molding or hot embossing of plastic replicates with integral metallic screens onto a LIGA-fabricated master microtool, to produce sacrificial electroforming molds in which the metallic screen acts as the conducting base and the plastic features provide insulating sidewalls for electrodeposition of the desired metallic micropart. Since many plastic replicates of the electroforming molds could be produced rapidly from a single LIGA-fabricated microstamp base, the need for repetitive synchrotron exposure and development is obviated, thus resulting in an economical and commercial advantage. Proposed is a balanced computational and experimental study on the transport phenomena governing the fabrication process, to systematically investigate the effects of the various process, material, and geometric parameters. A comprehensive processing-to-part simulation capability will be developed, which will be used to investigate the competing effects of the phenomena governing the process and, in turn, to derive optimum process and material designs. Experimental studies will focus on (a) characterization of microscale polymer rheology of the materials considered to provide the needed fundamental information in the modeling; and (b) several systematic processing runs to validate the computational models and to demonstrate the optimum regimes identified from the modeling. The proposed program will have a significant technological impact in the MEMS industry through the development of capabilities for rapid and cost-effective fabrication of microparts.<br/>BROADER IMPACT: The program will have significant educational impact by training two graduate students in an important field of much technological relevance. The students will gain valuable experience through internships and close interactions with researchers at Sandia during the program. Efforts will be made to recruit one or both students who are either women or from other underrepresented groups, which will broaden the societal impact.<br/>

Seismometers measure these waves, and the science of building more and more sensitive seismometers extends back for many years.  Almost all seismometers consist of a mass suspended by a spring.  Usually an electronic circuit senses the displacement of the mass (with respect to the seismometer's frame) when a seismic wave produces a local vibration.  Under continuing funding from the National Science Foundation, we are developing a new seismometer which uses optics instead of electronics to sense mass motion.  New signal-processing electronics allow us to analyze laser light reflected from the seismometer mass and detect displacements as small as a trillionth of a meter.  A variety of advantages are afforded from this new technique, including a high dynamic range and wide bandwidth, a calibration based on the wavelength of laser light, a connection to the sensor via fiber optic cables rather than electrical ones, and elimination of electronics in the sensor package.  Our research over the next two years will include further noise-reduction efforts and independently monitored tests of our new seismometer at seismic observatories other than our own.

The primary goal of this project is to investigate the hypothesis that scientists who have dyslexia, when compared to those scientists without dyslexia, evidence context-dependent advantages and disadvantages when using and processing computer imaging displays. These predicted advantages include discerning image features that are dependent on making visual comparisons across a single figure and identifying or locating objects embedded in a distracting background, when the background is familiar.  The predicted disadvantages include identifying or locating objects embedded in an unfamiliar distracting background and making visual comparisons across multiple figures.  This project builds on the prior success of the PI's investigations that have been funded by the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (HSCA) to study the characteristics of scientists with dyslexia. <br/><br/>This team from the Smithsonian Institution Astrophysical Observatory (SIAO), which is lead by a researcher with dyslexia and who is an expert from the HSCA's science education department, is conducting a series of behavioral laboratory protocols with scientists to determine the presence or absence of dyslexia and the visual-spatial skills of the subjects.  The proposal includes a quasi-experimental design to compare the performance of 22 astrophysicists with dyslexia to a matched comparison cohort of 22 astrophysicists without dyslexia; subjects are being recruited from both the HSCA and the American Astronomical Society.<br/><br/>The project addresses a key need in the RDE community: To demonstrate the value added component of a disabling condition, that is, dyslexia, as part of the career success of researchers in science fields.  There is a formative and summative project evaluation plan which is being conducted by an external evaluator, Illona Holland, from the Harvard University's Graduate School of Education. Additional formative project input is provided by a team of expert advisors who include Kurt Fischer, the Director of the Harvard University's Mind Brain and Education Program; Marc Pomplun, the Director of the University of Massachusetts-Boston's Visual Attention Laboratory; Marisa Carrasco, the Chair of New York University's Psychology Department; and Susanna Martinez-Conde, Director of the Laboratory of Visual Neuroscience at the Barrow Neurological Institute.  There is also a dissemination plan which includes sharing information with the RDE community at the annual PI meeting, publishing in peer-reviewed professional journals, and presenting information to the Council of Chief State School Officers.

The research will be conducted among African-American and European-American adult populations in New York City; Japanese adult populations in Tokyo, Japan; and Hindu Indian adult populations in Baroda, India. The research is expected to identify cultural variation in rules of reciprocity and in the moral meanings of everyday social support exchange.  African-American, Japanese, and Indian respondents are predicted to give greater weight to generalized reciprocity than European-American respondents.  Generalized reciprocity is expected to be associated with greater comfort in accepting help than is balanced reciprocity. It is further predicted that a distinct moral outlook on social support will be evident in each community, with European-Americans giving greatest weight to personal discretion, African-Americans stressing the importance of ongoing affective bonds based on mutual reliance, Japanese emphasizing the need to promote smooth interpersonal relationships, and Indians according priority to role-based duty.  The hypotheses are to be tested in a series of naturalistic and experimental interview studies that assess rules of reciprocity, moral meanings, social assurance, as well as positive and negative implications for the self linked to cultural differences in social support.  Some of the long-term objectives of the project include: a) enhanced understanding of the processes contributing to cultural variation in the experience of social solidarity; b) an emphasis on the need to go beyond the individualism/collectivism dichotomy in understanding cultural outlooks; and c) uncovering mental health implications of the different culturally-based approaches to social support. The research will promote inter-cultural understanding by challenging stereotypic views held of collectivist and individualist cultures, as well as broaden knowledge of understudied populations. In addition, graduate students from each culture will participate in training activities during each project year.   <br/> <br/>

We consider multi-hop wireless networks were a large number of nodes are statically placed and only some of them can move. By using ILP techniques we want to show that routes and schedules for the mobile nodes can be found that optimize crucial network performance metrics, such as the network lifetime and the end-to-end data packet latency. Contributions of the proposed research are multifold. We expect to advance the state of the art in wireless networks where some nodes are mobile. Furthermore, we will test and push the current capabilities in ILP modeling and solution technology. Among the expected outcome of the proposed research we will define complex models of realistic (in size, parameters, etc.) network scenarios; we will develop and test heuristics to make the ILP formulations more scalable; we will determine provable performance bounds on metrics of interests for wireless network, and we will compare heuristic solutions to these bounds for rigorous benchmarking and protocol design and optimization.

Itsweire	09/30/2010	$255,938.00		cwinant@ucsd.edu	8602 La Jolla Shores Dr	LA JOLLA	CA	920930210	8585341293	GEO	1610	0000, OTHR	$0.00	Intellectual Merit<br/>Observations of circulation and related physical variables have been collected in Bahia Concepcion, on the Gulf of California side of the Baja California peninsula in Mexico. The first goal of the original study was to describe through observations how rotation affects the wind-driven circulation in a relatively deep, well-mixed, semi-enclosed bay. We are in the process of submitting those results for publication. The period of observations, originally planned to last only through the well-mixed winter season, was extended to the entire year, including the highly stratified summer season. The extended data set gives us the opportunity to describe the physics of the bay when the water column is stratified. This study focuses on three separate time scales: the seasonal cycle associated with the onset and demise of stratification, the internal tides, and the barotropic and baroclinic seiches. The second goal of the original study was to develop an analytical model to represent the circulation driven by tides and the effects of friction and rotation on the estuarine flow. Those tasks are now complete. Motivated by the results of the winter observations we propose here to develop analytical models of three-dimensional time-dependent wind-driven flow, including the effect of advection, and to extend the tidal modeling effort to include stratified basins.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/>The ecological and societal importance of small coastal basins (bays, estuaries, lagoons) is out<br/>of proportion with their size. Among many other important ecological functions, lagoons and estuaries serve as way stations for migrating birds, as nurseries for an immense variety of fauna and flora and as mating and calving grounds for marine mammals such as the Pacific gray whale. At the same time these water bodies have been deeply impacted by anthropogenic activities. Many, if not all, are used as pathways through which sewage and contaminated waters are introduced into the ocean. In the past three years we have developed contacts with and given talks to engineering consultants and lay groups who are stewards of several lagoons in San Diego county. We plan to further develop these associations by providing free advice and consultation. By way of mitigation, The So. Cal. Edison company is undertaking an eighty million dollar restoration of San Dieguito Lagoon, north of San Diego. Here we propose to work with Coastal Environments, the consultancy charged with the scientific management of the project at the same time as we advise the San Dieguito Lagoon conservancy and other advocate groups. This project will allow us to participate in summer hands-on activities with high school students, and continue our outreach efforts with Florida elementary schools. In addition, this study represents a collaboration between scientists from the USA, including a minority representative, and Mexican scientists. The study will continue to enhance the participation of minority groups in science. It will train one graduate student and one Post-Doc and expose many others, including minority undergraduates, to state-of-the-art data collection, analysis and the application of numerical models. It will facilitate international cooperation and capacity building in Mexico and will also greatly enhance the courses taught by the PIs at graduate and undergraduate levels.<br/>

The requested instrumentation consists of 128 dual-socket/dual-core nodes, a front-end node, upgraded storage servers, larger memory (16Gb) postprocessing servers and on-site spares.  The cluster, which will serve to update the existing Center for Observations, Modeling, and Prediction at Scripps (COMPAS) cluster, will help support regional to global scale ocean-atmosphere-land modeling, process-oriented modeling of small-scale ocean physics, and process-oriented ocean modeling and state estimation. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/>The existing and proposed instrumentation will provide post-docs, graduate students and undergraduates with hands-on computing skills to enable current and future research efforts.  Additionally, the PIs anticipate that the capabilities afforded by the requested instrumentation will be useful in attracting new faculty and supporting collaborative efforts, past examples of which are described in the proposal.  Additionally, collaboration with the San Diego Supercomputer Center allows for improvements to cluster management software to be distributed back to the wider cluster community.<br/><br/>

The instrument package consists of an upper command unit attached to a lance and ballast. It is deployed by free-fall from a ship and embeds the lance in the sediment. One or more ports on the lance are connected to a high resolution pressure transducer and the initial insertion pressure pulse, decay, and final equilibrium are recorded along with the bottom pressure. The difference between the equilibrium value and the hydrostatic gradient give the state of over- or underpressure and ultimately the state of stress and nature of fluid flow. The instrument can be left on the bottom for months or years for a continuous record of pressure or can be recovered after reaching equilibrium. An acoustic release mechanism separates the command unit from the lance and ballast and the command unit floats to the surface for recovery. <br/><br/>Pore pressure is a fundamental physical parameter for determining the current state of stress and the rate of transport of fluid and energy within the sediment. In spite of this, direct measurements of pore pressure by the marine hydrogeology community have been rare. This has primarily been due to the lack of instrumentation with adequate resolution and other important qualities. Recent advances in various technologies have made such measurements possible and there has been a resurgence of interest for such measurements within the international marine geoscience community. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/><br/>Development of the seafloor piezometer will require international collaboration as well as collaboration with industry. As the PIs point out, this instrument could become an integral part of a number of national and international programs (RIDGE, MARGINS, IODP, NEPTUNE), and could be used to address many of the questions that represent the stated goals of these programs. In addition, pore pressure data is valuable for researchers studying problems with societal relevance, such as earthquake responses, gas hydrate formation, and mass wasting events. The proposal includes support for a graduate student in instrument design. <br/>

If the intial flow is avortex, these perturbations take the form of toroidal or rib vortices. As they amplify, they begin to interact, forming dipoles that move out of the initially unstable region. In axisymmetric flows, the net effect of the motion and interaction of these vortices is homogenization of potential vorticity, forcing it to vanish in the instability region and beyond which then stabilizes the flow. Recently, scientists from Scripps Institute of Oceanography and the University of Hawaii have found that they can predict, with remarkable precision, the final state after this nonlinear process. They now plan to develop this theory for predicting the evolution of other kinds of vortices as well. Their work will involve numerical and theoretical research of three-dimensional flows and ill consider how this process competes with other instabilities. The results have implcations for the stabilization and maintenance of oceanic currents and eddies. In addition, the results will have an impact on the the development of models which can not resolve small scale processes. <br/><br/>

While a very strong case can be made for the former, in many cases an equally<br/>strong case can be made against the use of a worst case approach to performance, since it can lead to overly<br/>conservative systems. This proposal is motivated by the possibility (substantiated by the co PIs preliminary<br/>work) of addressing these issues through the use of a risk adjusted approach, where the designer is willing<br/>to trade off a preassigned risk of violating a performance specification in return for a reduction, often<br/>substantial, in both the complexity of the resulting controller and its conservatism. Advantages offered by<br/>the proposed framework over currently available techniques include the abilities to:<br/>a.- Systematically synthesize low complexity, practically implementable robust systems.<br/>b.- Lead to tractable problems, and in cases where the underlying problem is intrinsically hard, to<br/>provide for computationally tractable relaxations with risk adjusted certificates. Examples of these<br/>cases include model (in)validation under arbitrary uncertainty structures and fixer order controller<br/>synthesis, both beyond the ability of hitherto available methods.<br/>c.- Indicate the intrinsic limits of performance of the plant, making unavoidable design tradeoffs clear<br/>and allowing the control engineer to explicitly make these tradeoffs, without trial and error iterations,<br/>gracefully degrading performance when some of the requirements cannot be met.<br/>Broader Impact: In addition to advancing the current state of the art in control theory, the proposed research<br/>will bring closer to being practical several technologies currently at the proof of concept stage. Examples<br/>of these include active vision applications to aware environments and communication networks with improved<br/>robustness and quality of service characteristics. Arguably one of the critical factors preventing the<br/>deployment of these technologies beyond controlled lab environments is the lack of robustness of the resulting<br/>systems. Addressing this fragility is beyond the ability of currently available robust control techniques<br/>due to their poor computational and scaling properties.<br/>Educational Impact: In addition to benefiting graduate education, we plan to incorporate results from this<br/>research in an undergraduate introductory robust control course, that will expose students at an earlier stage<br/>to the issues of robustness and computational complexity. Typically this is done at the graduate level, and<br/>thus undergraduate students are unaware of these ideas, although it could be argued that they are some of<br/>most powerful and better developed assets that our community has, with a potential that extend beyond<br/>pure control. Risk adjusted ideas provide an ideal vehicle to accomplish this initial exposure, eliminating<br/>the need to wait until students build the background in functional analysis required to tackle graduate level<br/>robust control courses.

The consequences of these intensified interactions and the actions that society could take to affect their course remain largely unknown. To address this gap, the nature and types of behaviors that result when humans and landscapes closely interact will be investigated with an integrated program of numerical model development, model testing, individualized and classroom instruction and public outreach for two specific cases: barrier island resorts, such as on the US east coast, and mountainous urban-wildland interfaces, such as on the margins of Los Angeles. Numerical models will be developed that include representations of both the behavior of economic and management actors and the ways in which landscapes respond to natural processes and human influence. Significant effort will be devoted to communicating the results and implications to other researchers, students, policy managers and the general public.<br/><br/>Barrier islands are low-lying strips of sand that are parallel to and separated from the mainland coast by lagoons, cut by inlets, and topped by sand dunes; they are popular vacation destinations. Barrier islands are modeled by tracking changes to their shape and volume from: beach erosion and deposition owing to storms and waves. The economics of resorts are modeled using two markets: a hotel building/buying/selling market, which connects profit-maximizing developers and hotel owners; and a tourism market, which connects hotel owners with tourists seeking the best vacation experience for their money. Managers in the model widen the beach and build up dunes to protect against storms and enhance beach quality. The model will be tested against historical measurements from the US east coast and will be used to explore how barrier island resorts respond to rising sea level and increased storminess resulting from global climate change.<br/><br/>The margins of mountain catchments offer attractive residential attributes, but development is subject to an array of significant hazards. In the model being developed for the urban-wildland boundary zone, shrubland vegetation grows between fires; wildfires consume vegetation and residences and promote erosion; landslides, floods and sediment-laden debris flows damage or destroy residences; developers build housing developments whose size and location are based on projected profits; and residents buy houses based on projected appreciation and attributes such as view and commute distance. Managers in the model approve developments; mitigate fires with prescribed burns; mitigate landslides, floods and debris flows with slope stabilization, debris basins, reservoirs and channel stabilization and entrenchment; and suppress fires. Historical data on fires, floods and urban expansion in Los Angeles will be used to test the model, and the effect of urbanization on fire size and frequency and the long-term change through space and time of the urban-wildland boundary under differing management strategies will be investigated.<br/><br/>This research bears directly on societally relevant problems and policy decisions associated with human encroachment on the natural environment and disaster management. Its broader impact will include individualized and classroom instruction, meetings with coastal managers and public outreach. One graduate student and three undergraduates will be introduced to and trained in techniques to address this category of problems and a UCSD course entitled Urban Landscapes will be taught to educate a broader group of students. The results will be presented to scientists and the public in web pages, two radio programs that will be produced from this project, and as a poster and computer exhibit at the Assateague Island National Seashore Visitor Center.<br/><br/>

Baerwald	01/31/2009	$12,000.00		SHANSON@CLARKU.EDU	950 MAIN ST	WORCESTER	MA	016101400	5084213835	SBE	1352	1352, 9179, SMET	$0.00	In May 2007 Poland and seven other European countries joined the European Union and gained free access to the labor market in several EU countries.  As a result, about 700,000 people have left Poland to look for jobs in the United Kingdom.  This doctoral dissertation research project will explore how urban quality of life and characteristics of the local labor market shape motivations to migrate and are differently evaluated by men and women and how the migration of skilled professionals affects urban economies in Poland.  In the first part of the project, the doctoral candidate will investigate what characteristics of cities in Poland motivated young, educated professionals to emigrate.  Most current research that deals with motivations for migration focuses either on individual economic reasons or on disparities in economic development on the national level, but in this project, the student will focus specifically on the urban-level factors that encourage young people to migrate.  She also will investigate gender differences in migration motivations.  The second part of the project will focus on how the emigration of young professionals has affected the economy and social cohesion of select Polish cities.  Semi-structured interviews and focus-group discussions with migrants will provide information about how the urban environment motivates men and women to migrate to the UK.  The impact of emigration on the cities of origin will be investigated through interviews with key-informants in Polish municipal governments and through a survey of companies in the selected Polish cities.<br/><br/>The proposed research will increase understanding about the ongoing integration of European labor markets.  Because several countries have legislated incentives for professional migration, the mobility of young professionals is increasing across the European Union.  This study will provide new insights regarding the urban-level causes that underlie this migration and the consequences of migration for cities in the sending countries.  Cities all around the world are competing for skilled labor, so urban leaders need to understand how the negative characteristics of urban environments encourage emigration of skilled citizens.  Understanding the causes of emigration will provide guidelines for making cities more attractive for skilled, educated professionals.  The study also will address gaps in the literature with regard to the gendered experience of the urban environment and its impact on men's and women's migration decisions.  As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.<br/><br/>

This research asks: What are scientists doing with race since the mapping of the human genome? How do new institutional arrangements in the field of molecular genetics affect changes in the questions asked and the interpretations made? Do the producers of today''''s biological racial discourse share a certain set of values and conceptualizations that influence their work? The project examines all publications expressing views pertaining to the molecular debate over race. First, the concepts, terms, and arguments of this discourse will be coded and analyzed for patterns of confluence, variance, and consistency. Second, the institutional configuration of laboratories, regulatory bodies, funding agencies, pharmaceutical companies, science media, and DNA fingerprinting corporations will be analyzed for its capacity to shape this discourse on race. Finally, all participants in the debate - scientists, researchers and analysts who have authored relevant publications - will be interviewed. The interviews will draw out values and conceptualizations that scientists bring to the discourse and help us understand their own motivations for and perceptions of the work they do. <br/><br/>Molecular genetics is fast becoming a dominant paradigm of biological science; therefore, this research will illuminate highly pertinent discussions of race. Additionally, this research will promote future ties between sociology and the natural sciences.  Interviews will provide an opportunity for the co-PI to form relationships with the leading geneticists who are defining race today. These relationships will encourage dialogue and constructive critique between disciplines. The co-PI will report her findings to the National Human Genome Research Institute''''s Ethical, Legal and Social Implications (ELSI) Research Program in the hope that a critical discourse and lucid policy may be formulated.

The medium to large bubbles that persist for just a few seconds in the upper ocean during and immediately after wave breaking are thought to play a dominant role in the transport of carbon dioxide. Because it is difficult, for technological and logistical reasons, to make these measurements, there are very few data sets that characterize bubble distributions within whitecaps. <br/><br/>Scientists at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography will conduct an experiment whereby bubbles in a turbulent fluid of various sizes will be fragmented. As the bubbles fragment they emit an acoustic signal that will be recorded with hydrophones. In addition, two cameras will record the details of the bubble breakup. The ultimate goal of the research is to determine bubble creation rates at the ocean surface. Although noise is known to come from bubbles as they form, the mechanisms that determine the amount of energy associated with the acoustic oscillations is not yet known. If it were, this work could lead to the development of a tool that allows one to measure bubble creation rates based upon ambient noise measurements. The experiment and data analysis will include the participation of an undergraduate intern.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>

Ronald Eastman	MA	Clark University	Standard Grant	Thomas J. Baerwald	01/31/2009	$10,290.00		reastman@clarku.edu	950 MAIN ST	WORCESTER	MA	016101400	5084213835	SBE	1352	1352, 9179, 9278, SMET	$0.00	Spatially explicit land-cover change modeling and change projection are critical tools for environmental planning and biodiversity conservation.  In these models, proximity to roads is universally identified as a critical explanatory variable in land cover change.  Land-change projections therefore are severely limited unless the road infrastructure is similarly modeled and projected.  Few attempts have been made to model road development and all require the specification of critical parameters that are not empirically derived but set by trial and error.  This doctoral dissertation research project will develop an empirically parameterized road-extension model to project the development of a road network that preserves the existing spatial arrangement.  To pursue this objective, the doctoral candidate will answer the following questions:  (1) How can the spatial arrangement of a road network be quantitatively characterized?  (2)What is the relationship between the network''s spatial arrangement and regional characteristics?  (3)How can this relationship be incorporated into road extension simulation to replicate the network pattern?  (4)Does the model improve road extension simulation and land change projection, and if so, by how much?  The student will measure topological and geometric attributes of a road network to classify patterns.  Empirical relationships between the road network patterns and regional characteristics will be used to control the projection of road development through confining location of endpoints and routes of new roads.  The road model is expected to project the road extension by giving the location of individual roads while maintaining the pattern of the entire road network.  The new model to be developed in this project will be validated using data on the growth of the road network in lowland Bolivia from 1986 to 2000.<br/><br/>This project will simulate the road extension under the current or planned development strategies.  The model to be developed through this project will enhance predictions regarding the location and the intensity of future human land use and help to prioritize land for biodiversity conservation planning.  The project also will lay a foundation for theoretically and practically addressing the interplay between land use and road infrastructure development.  By embracing land-cover characteristics in modeling road extension, the project will acknowledge roads as an endogenous factor of land change.  A land-change model that dynamically integrates the road-extension model will incorporate the feedback between the road and land systems.  The results of the research will be incorporated into a future release of the Land Change Modeler for Ecological Sustainability as part of the IDRISI GIS and Image Processing System.  Because IDRISI is a non-profit system intended to serve related research, education, and government fields at low cost, the road-extension model thus will be made available to thousands of users in these communities.  As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.

However, the architectural design of modern microprocessors has mainly concentrated on improving the average-case performance by using techniques such as cache memory, branch prediction, and speculative execution, which can significantly compromise the time predictability of computing and make the accurate worst-case execution time (WCET) analysis extremely difficult.  This project is designing a highly time-predictable VLIW architecture while keeping the advantages of VLIW architectures in terms of high performance and hardware simplicity. The project also studies novel compiler techniques to support the time-predictable VLIW architecture, including scheduling-aware scratch-pad memory management, full and partial if-conversion with implicit path enumeration (IPE), compiler-directed nop insertion to remove pipeline timing effects, and WCET-oriented compiler optimizations. The success of this project is expected to accelerate the design, implementation, and deployment of time-predictable VLIW processors for a wide range of hard real-time applications, which can benefit both the embedded processor industry and the society. The developed software packages are made publicly available through the PI's research website.

An important yet poorly understood process with strong implications for understanding and predicting long-term North American drought is how the coupled ocean-atmosphere system maintains persistent cool conditions in the equatorial Pacific Ocean.<br/><br/>This project will make an initial attempt to answer four questions:  (1) how are persistent cool episodes in the equatorial Pacific Ocean represented in state-of-the-art coupled climate models, (2) through what physical mechanisms do such conditions lead to persistent North American drought, (3) how can an understanding of such questions serve to extend the predictive lead time for long-term North American drought, and (4) how do the mechanisms and prospects for predictability depend on the essence of a climate in transition?<br/><br/>A two-pronged approach will be taken:  first, a selection of coupled models as determined from the details of their ocean component will be used to characterize and explain the representation of persistent cool equatorial Pacific conditions; secondly, long-term North American drought variability (in terms of the Palmer drought severity index - PDSI) and its relationships with the equatorial Pacific, including how that appears to depend on anthropogenic forcing, will be analyzed in the full suite of  Climate Model Intercomparison Project 3 (CMIP3) climate models.  The problem of predictability at extended lead times will be explored by ascertaining how the remote forcing field itself (i.e., low-frequency evolution of equatorial Pacific SST) is modulated, and the coherence between that signal and the PDSI.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of these are in its potential contribution to improved prediction of North American drought at extended leads and in supporting the principal investigator, who is a graduate student.<br/>

The project uses the theory of planned behavior to examine the interactive effects of attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived control to predict interests and behavioral intentions of participating in math fields. In addition, the project examines an understudied effect among adolescents, namely the role of stereotype threat in affecting attitudes toward and performance in math. The project proposes that stereotype threat should be examined as a mediating factor impeding girls? and minorities? performance and interest in math. <br/><br/>The main hypotheses are that a modified theory of planned behavior will account for gender differences in math performance and behavioral intentions regarding math participation. Specifically, attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived control will predict behavioral intentions, but will be mediated by experiences with math-based stereotype threat. In addition, the effect of stereotype threat on performance will be moderated by personality traits such as dispositional tendencies toward gender-based threat. Students experiencing stereotype threat will have lower behavioral intentions and performance than students not experiencing stereotype threat. Greater experience of stereotype threat will lead to disengagement and avoidance of math, which will lead to lower behavioral intentions for math related activities. <br/><br/>A mixed methods approach is taken to examine multi-level variables influencing behavioral intentions. The targeted population is 600 middle school students (6th, 7th, and 8th grades) in a diverse school district in Los Angeles County, Azusa Unified School District. The project has three phases consisting of questionnaires and in-depth interviews with math teachers, counselors, students, and parents and an experimental induction of stereotype threat in math classes. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts-The project integrates teaching, learning, and research by directly involving students in all phases of the project. Educational infrastructure is enhanced by providing research opportunities and training to undergraduate students in psychology and sociology research. The existing networks between the university and local community and education system are further strengthened. The outcomes of the project are more in-depth knowledge of multi-level barriers and how they interact to affect math participation and performance among girls, ethnic minorities, and students with lower socioeconomic status. An executive summary of the findings will be distributed to participating schools? principals, counselors, teachers, and parents. In addition, top level district administrators will be briefed on the findings in a report and presentation. In the reports and summaries, the investigators make recommendations for educational practices and interventions based on the outcomes of the study. The results will be presented at national and regional conferences as well as at campus events for K-12 teacher-training, thus educating future researchers and teachers about the barriers to girls? and minorities? STEM participation. Finally, the results will be published in leading social science journals so that other researchers can adopt the successful aspects of the methodology and theoretical framework of the project.

Recently, there has been increasing interest in the circumstances under which stimuli presented in one sensory modality influence sensations in a different modality. For instance, the sound of a mosquito buzzing seemingly enhances sensitivity to touch (tactile stimulation) on our skin; seeing an insect crawling on someone else's arm seems to affect our own tactile perception. Despite several recent studies examining the influence of audition and vision on touch, the brain mechanisms responsible for these interactions are poorly understood.  An NSF-funded collaborative effort of Tony Ro (Rice University) and Michael Beauchamp (University of Texas Health Science Center, Houston) will use a combination of converging methods to examine tactile processing in isolation and the influence of vision and audition on touch in the human brain. Psychophysical studies will be conducted to determine the optimal stimulus parameters that demonstrate an influence of vision and audition on tactile perception. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and magnetoencephalography (MEG) will be used to localize the brain regions involved with integrating multisensory information.  While most of these experiments will be conducted using normal controls, an additional series of experiments will be conducted in a unique patient who acquired auditory-tactile synesthesia following a stroke.  Tactile sensitivity on the patient's left hand and arm was impaired, but he now feels tactile sensations in that area in response to sounds. Psychophysical and imaging experiment will be completed on this patient to determine the neural mechanisms responsible for the synesthesia, especially whether plastic neural changes have reconstituted the patient's somatosensory cortex so that it is now responds to sounds.<br/><br/>These studies will not only better our understanding of multisensory integration, but will provide a deeper appreciation of general information processing mechanisms of the human brain.  Such knowledge will contribute towards the development of better rehabilitative tools for patients with congenital or acquired sensory deficits to one or more of the sensory systems.  Additionally, this research will provide a better understanding of the mechanisms of natural and brain-damaged induced changes that take place in the adult human brain.  The funding will be used to support research training opportunities for undergraduate, graduate, and post-doctoral trainees in cognitive neuroscience and brain imaging in the Houston area.  In addition to training the next generation of brain scientists, the findings of this research will be disseminated through scientific and lay publications, as well as other media outlets, allowing for a deeper understanding and appreciation of the human brain in society.<br/>

Whitmire of Rice University to explore molecular routes to a variety of nanoscale materials with interesting magnetic properties composed of main group elements (E) and transition metals (M).   Cluster molecules with well-defined shape and size will be converted into E-M materials by suitable thermal, chemical or photochemical treatment in order to define the factors that will permit control of the stoichiometry and properties of the resulting materials.  In some cases nanoparticles arise directly upon mixing molecular precursors, and attempts will be made to isolate and characterize discrete molecular species that are intermediates on the pathway to particle growth in order to understand how the nanoparticles develop. Structures of these intermediates will be compared to the final materials for insight into the growth mechanism. One particular series that will be targeted is the iron/manganese pnictide system.  A number of discrete cluster compounds having the correct E-M stoichiometry for conversion to known MxEy (M = Fe, Mn; E = pnictogen) phases are available. The conditions that are required to achieve these conversions as well as the effect of ancillary ligands and bound-organic functions will be examined in order to tailor the decompositions to optimize conditions and product properties. This system is particularly flexible because isostructural cluster compounds with different E or M constituents can be prepared and used to introduce dopants into the final materials. In conjunction with these fundamental studies, conditions for production of the cluster products will be optimized in order to make use of these compounds viable. <br/><br/>The synthesis of magnetic materials as nanoparticles of well-defined composition and properties will contribute to the fundamental knowledge and understanding of the chemistry involved in the production of important materials that may be employed in the electronics and related industries. This project will also train students for the workforce that is necessary to support the electronics industry.  <br/>

This vision will be realized and test-driven via a deployed experimental wireless mesh network in an under-resourced Houston community with experimental mobile devices distributed to community residents.  Residents of the community will be engaged with ethnographically-driven qualitative inquiry and analysis to better understand their needs, usage, and user-perceived performance of the wireless infrastructure.  This project presents an unprecedented opportunity to holistically study all components of a wireless system, from the end user to the mesh backhaul.<br/><br/>With a multi-disciplinary approach spanning wireless networking, mobile computing, and ethnographic techniques, this project will make fundamental contributions in (i) theory and development of predictable and resilient mesh network services, (ii) design and deployment of usable and energy-efficient mobile access, and (iii) ethnographic evaluation of user impact in under-resourced urban communities.<br/><br/>This project will produce new technologies for optimizing wireless mobile computing and understanding the technological needs of under-resourced urban communities.  The experimental deployment in an under-resourced and primarily Hispanic Houston community will provide low-cost access to IT for its residents.  Its success will demonstrate the possibility to achieve affordable, economically-sustainable, wireless broadband access for all.  The project will offer opportunities for minority students in the universities and the served neighborhoods.  Our extensive collaboration with community leaders, equipment manufacturers, and health-care providers will help transfer technologies and lessons for future IT deployments.<br/>

The simulations will be done using the latest version of the Rice Convection Model (RCM).  The motivations are twofold: 1) understand better the central importance of the transfer of depleted plasma sheet flux tubes into the inner magnetosphere; and 2) incorporate this improved understanding into the computational machinery of the RCM in order to enhance and evaluate its use as a practical tool for representing space weather. In addition, the proposed research will serve as a thorough validation of recent significant modifications to the RCM, including but not necessarily limited to the inclusion of magnetic flux tube interchange effects, dipole tilt and the ability to operate with a much broader range of magnetic field configurations.  The recent improvements to the RCM also include a simple data assimilation scheme for operational use that ensures model electron fluxes are consistent with available geosynchronous spacecraft data. <br/><br/>At the end of the project, the fully validated RCM will be made available to the space science community, either through the Community Coordinated Modeling Center or through Rice University.  The project also includes an educational impact through the support of a postdoctoral researcher and a graduate student.<br/>

They decompose the feedstock gas to dissolve the released carbon atoms, which then rapidly diffuse to feed the growth of a carbon stem, a nanotube. The robustness of this process, its yield and the particular physical type of the emerging tubule-its diameter and chiral symmetry-are all determined by the drama of atomic dynamics and chemical interactions within this few cubic nanometers. In spite of great technological importance and decade-long progress in nanotube synthesis and theoretical modeling, the fundamental understanding of the processes guiding nanotube nucleation and growth is lacking. Based on previous experience, we propose a systematic study to advance the science of nanotube growth. Among several important aspects, we focus mainly on the (i) structure and state of the catalyst particle and its interface with the nanotube edge, (ii) the mechanisms of catalyst poisoning and how it can be delayed or prevented, and (iii) the defect annealing in the course of tube growth; the latter will further be connected with finding possible mechanisms defining the chirality of the emerging tube and how it can possibly be controlled. <br/><br/>The intellectual merit of the proposed research lies in advancing the understanding of the intimate atomic mechanisms of carbon nanotube growth. In particular, it should reveal the interatomic physico-chemical interactions inside and at the surface of the catalyst particle. We plan to connect three scales of study (ab initio, atomistic-classical MD, and continuum phenomenological model), which has additional merit from the multiscale modeling viewpoint. The main intellectual value of course will lie in revealing the catalyst poisoning mechanism and how to reduce it, the structure of catalyst particle-nanotube interface, and the exact mechanisms of atomic accretion of carbon and the annealing of the structural defects in the body of the growing tube, in order to maintain its perfection. Based on accumulated knowledge we hope to suggest possible paths to achieving controlled chirality (and diameter) specific growth of nanotubes-a holy grail of materials chemists and especially carbon nanotube researchers and technology users. Beyond carbon nanotubes, the effort should provide more general insights into catalytic growth of other nearly-one-dimensional structures. General features established for carbon tubules may apply to boron-nitride tubes, and yet broader class of nanowires (silicon, boron, and other important inorganic compositions). <br/><br/>Elements of educational activities are seamlessly integrated in this three-year project. An undergraduate and a graduate student will interact closely with the PI and Co-PI (as well as with nearly a dozen of other students and postdocs presently in the PI's group). The cross-disciplinary nature of the project, involving elements of computational quantum chemistry, molecular dynamics, nanomechanics, and dislocation theory, encourages training of truly interdisciplinary scientists. Elements of the research will be eventually incorporated into the already-offered (by PI) course MSCI614 Principles of Nanoscale Materials. The graduate student will gain some teaching experience through offering (later in the project) a few lectures within the course, on the topics related to this project. Rice has been working very aggressively at increasing the participation of underrepresented groups through targeted recruiting efforts. In this case, within the project we anticipate to engage Rice undergraduates and students from Mexico (who have previously spent the summer in the PI's group). We will work closely with DOD Air Force Research Laboratory (Materials Directorate) specifically interested in novel CNT-based materials, and with DOE ORNL colleagues interested in carbon nanostructure synthetic routs and improvements. <br/>

Examples include remote surgery, physical manipulation of nano-structures, autonomous (ground and air) vehicular travel, and space and terrestrial exploration.  Because such applications interact directly with the physical world, it is imperative their physical safety be assured.  This project is developing a comprehensive formal framework for producing controllers for cyber-physical systems, with machine checkable proofs of their physical safety.  The project brings together ideas from control theory, language design, program verification, program generation, software engineering, and real-time and embedded systems to build a framework that can be applied to challenging applications.  The framework promotes an efficient, rigorous engineering process for producing embedded controllers, incorporating explicit models not only of the controller itself, but also of the physical context in which it operates, the required stability conditions, the platform on which it will run, and the associated real-time constraints.  The results of the project are being demonstrated and evaluated in the context of a tele-surgery application.  This application is currently being developed at the Mechatronics and Haptic Interfaces Lab in the Mechanical Engineering Department at Rice University.

Cochran of William Marsh Rice University in Houston Texas. The broad goal of the project is to find applications of methods of noncommutative algebra to problems in topology and group theory. Over the last ten years the PI and collaborators have developed a vast theory of so-called higher-order Alexander modules, linking forms and signatures. These can be associated to knots, links, 3-manifolds, spaces, groups or even surface homeomorphisms. The PI and Shelly Harvey have many new results on how homology constrains these invariants of the fundamental group.  The project will apply these techniques to important open problems in topology and group theory. Specific goals are:  to find a refinement of Heegard Floer Knot Homology that better reflects the noncommutativity of the fundamental group of the knot exterior; to use higher-order signatures to construct quasi-homomorphisms of subgroups of mapping class groups and to construct homology classes for such subgroups; to further investigate the knot concordance group, both topological and smooth; to apply these techniques to study algebraic curves in complex 2-space;  to continue to find further relationships between homology equivalence and fundamental group and  apply these results to the virtual betti number problem in 3-manifolds.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>This project studies mathematical aspects of the shape, or topology, of 3-dimensional objects. Shape is very important in the study of networks, search algorithms, in the design of drugs, satellite recognition of objects, the medical imaging and modeling of human organs and in the function of cellular DNA. Even though all common objects are 3-dimensional in nature, such shapes can be quite complicated. For example, the shape of a tangled piece of string is quite complex. Moreover much is unknown: the shapes of most proteins, for example. How can an imaging device distinguish a tank from a house given only partial data? How can one usefully quantify the shape of a brain given that all brains are different? The scientific study of shape requires mathematical ideas that can accurately quantify the complex non-linear behavior of such objects. Grade-school mathematics is very linear: 2 times 3 equals 3 times two. In college one learns that noncommutative algebra, such as matrices where AB is not necessarily BA, is necessary to model simple real-life situations. This project will develop new tools in noncommutative mathematics and apply these to specific problems concerning the shape of 3-dimensional objects.

This research project addresses this question by analyzing how electoral incentives and party politics shape agenda control in the Mexican state legislatures.   Over the past twenty years, the concurrent rise of electoral competition and fiscal decentralization has encouraged the state legislatures to assert their autonomy across a range of policy domains. No longer are deputies automatically deferring to the governor's office; they have instead become active participants of the political press and thus merit greater attention.  This growth in electoral competition has not proceeded evenly throughout the country.  Whereas some states enjoy vibrant political climates, there are many others where authoritarian enclaves still thrive. This situation provides an excellent opportunity to learn more about partisan agenda control, particularly about the extent to which it varies with economic and electoral competition by holding a variety of factors relatively constant.  This research project employs four main data sources to evaluate the variation in partisan agenda control across 30 of the 31 state legislatures. The first are elite interviews, in which former and current legislators discuss the relationship between legislator and party. The second are the agenda-setting rules governing each state legislature. The third are roll call voting records, the analysis of which can identify partisan affects on agenda control. The fourth is an in-depth case study of the agenda setting process in the state legislature of Nuevo Leon.  This research project contributes to our understanding of the effect electoral incentives have on partisan agenda control by addressing the primary limitation of the Mexican state politics literature: its reliance on single state case studies. By integrating the four data sources, this research project can systematically compare agenda control in the Mexican state legislatures across two legislative terms rather than simply limit itself to a few cases at particular points in time.  In short, the project will yield results that not only enjoy a high level of internal validity but can also inform us of contexts elsewhere in the world.<br/>

Bruce<br/>University of Massachusetts Amherst<br/>III-COR Searching Archives of Community Knowledge<br/><br/>The problem of recognizing or finding questions has received little attention, but is an important problem that is conceptually different than typical document search. The use of text transformation models learned from the Q&A archives has the potential of considerably advancing our knowledge of how models that have been very successful in machine translation applications can be applied to improve the effectiveness of search. This project will use two large archives of questions and answers to develop, test, and compare algorithms for more effective retrieval of questions that are semantically similar to the question posed by a current user and look to retrieve answers with a high probability of relevance. One aspect of addressing this challenge will be to apply text transformation techniques developed to support machine translation to the Q&A archives in order to learn probabilities to associate with word substitution in identifying semantically similar queries. The techniques will be evaluated for both English and Korean (since one of the Q&A archives is in Korean). Over a dozen alternative approaches to developing similarity measures will be tried and compared using a variety of performance metrics, primarily metrics that focus on the precision/relevance of results returned at the top of a ranked list. Development of successful approaches to the problem of retrieval of appropriate answers from archives of questions and answers will benefit many application areas

Typically, one simulates network hardware and software in software using, for example, the widely used ns-2 simulator. Experimentation proceeds by simulating the use of the network by a given population of users using applications such as ftp or web browsers. Synthetic workload generators are used to inject data into the network according to a model of how the applications or users behave.<br/><br/>In order to perform realistic network simulations, one needs a traffic generator that is capable of generating realistic synthetic traffic in a closed-loop fashion that ?looks like? traffic found on an actual network. Unfortunately, the networking community suffers from a lack of validated tools and models suitable for synthetic traffic generation. As a result, all too often, networking technology is evaluated using ad hoc workloads with an unknown relationship to traffic seen on real links and hence begs the question of how believable the results of the evaluation are.<br/><br/>This project is a collaborative effort to develop a synthetic traffic generation resource for the experimental networking research community. The resource consists of (1) synthetic traffic generators for the ns-2, ns-3, and GTNets software simulators, and Linux and BSD-based testbeds, (2) a repository of datasets to be used by the traffic generators to generate traffic that is statistically equivalent to traffic found on a variety of network links including campus networks, wide-area backbone networks, corporate intranets, wireless networks, etc, and (3) a set of traffic analysis tools to enable researchers to generate empirical models of traffic on network links of interest and to use these models to drive the synthetic traffic generation process.

The project is built on a conceptual framework that uses physical science and physics to strengthen students' concepts in pre-algebra, algebra, algebra 2 and geometry. Investigative Science Learning Environment (ISLE), an introductory physics curriculum that builds on advances in cognition, is modified to engage students in representing processes and knowledge in multiple ways using real world contexts for students to learn mathematics and physics. The physics Active Learning Guide (ALG) is included as a learning tool. The ultimate goal of the project is to use physics as the context to develop mathematics literacy, particularly with students from underrepresented populations and special needs students. The research component of this R&D project analyzes the effects of the PuM curriculum on students' learning using laboratory exercises, videos and unique experiments and associated equipment while simultaneously investigating teachers' pedagogy content knowledge in a variety of forms. During the period of funding, the project will: (1) develop a middle school and high school curriculum called PhysicsUnionMath (PuM) by adapting the already established curricula from ISLE and ALG for grades 6-12; (2) develop, pilot, and assess five middle school and high school Physics First PuM modules; (3) pilot and assess one full year of the proposed PuM curriculum with honors physics students; (4) design and implement a professional development plan for teachers to learn the program; and (5) study the implementation of this curriculum with the targeted populations.

The causes and consequences of this diversity remain unexplored, but the staggering degree of morphological variation suggests structure-function relationships between mechanosensor properties and their sensory roles. Using copepods as a model system, this work will address the relationship between the shape of mechanosensory structures and their movement under non steady-state fluid conditions. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to quantify the relationship between fluid motion and sensory morphology. Scanning electron microscopic measurements of the size and width of different setae and transmission electron microscopic measurements of cuticular thickness and the extent of the dendritic penetration up the shaft of individual mechanoreceptors will be made for three species of copepods. The force required to bend the seta and the physiological response of individual hairs to the well described flows created in the lab will be quantified with respect to the physical characteristics of the receptor. The empirical data will be used to build two interacting models: Finite Element Method (FEM) and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). The FEM will be used to model the motion of individual seta with known morphology and bending characteristics while the CFD will be used to calculate the hydrodynamic force and torque applied to each region of the seta and the influence of the seta on the surrounding flow. These data are fundamental to understanding how these small, neurologically simple organisms can distinguish from the myriad of biologically and physically induced fluid movements. <br/><br/>The project includes several self-contained sub-projects that will provide exceptional opportunities for motivated undergraduate students to receive hands-on research experience learning sophisticated culturing techniques, the fundamentals of optics, microvideography, neurophysiology and the power of numerical simulations. High school students will also be invited into the lab to maintain cultures and help the undergraduate students with their projects. The PI will also work with the COSEE program (designed to bring ocean science to rural areas) and the ''Keller Bloom'' project which provides a week long science immersion course to gifted high school students from rural Maine. Results of the project will also contribute to the development of other BLOS educational and outreach programs, most notably the Phytopia project http://www.bigelow.org/phytopia/) and a weekly summer seminar series open to the public.

While much attention is being focused on disturbances like fire and floods, eruptive bark beetle species have had equal or greater impact on western forest communities. Like all insects, bark beetles are highly sensitive to slight shifts in temperature, and recent warming trends may have resulted in increased outbreak frequency and range expansion into environments that were previously unoccupied by the beetles, such as high-elevation and high-latitude forests. Mountain pine beetle outbreaks are more common in lower elevation lodgepole pine forests but are thought to be relatively rare events in whitebark pine ecosystems. Outbreaks of mountain pine beetle in whitebark pine may be somewhat novel, with only a few documented outbreaks over the twentieth century. In recent years, however, mountain pine beetle outbreaks appear to be occurring more frequently in whitebark pine forests. The recent widespread appearance of mountain pine beetle in whitebark pine forests may be the result of changes to the life-cycle characteristics of mountain pine beetle or host susceptibility brought about by a warming climate. The long-term dynamics of mountain pine beetles in forests and the potential role of climate variability remains little understood because outbreaks are infrequent and historical records rarely extend beyond the twentieth century. This limits the number of events that can be examined and hinders the search for potential mechanisms producing outbreaks. This collaborative research project will increase the record of mountain pine beetle outbreaks in two watersheds using paleoecological reconstruction methods. The investigators will calibrate the historical record of mountain pine beetle outbreaks in common (e.g. lodgepole pine) and potentially novel (e.g. whitebark pine) forest ecosystems to extend outbreak histories further back in time by integrating dendrochronological techniques with lake sediment analyses. The use of these two paleoecological reconstruction methodologies takes advantage of the main strengths of each -- the annual resolution afforded by tree rings and the extraordinary depth of time that can be gleaned from lake sediments, which often exceed several thousand years. The investigators will develop detailed records of forest successional patterns following the most recent mountain pine beetle outbreaks using tree rings for comparison with longer records of vegetation and disturbance history available from pollen and insect remains found in lake sediments. Annually resolved reconstructions of summer temperature will be developed using tree-ring records from temperature sensitive trees to assess the role of climatic patterns related to bark beetle outbreaks. Records of successional patterns, climate variability, and beetle activity developed from tree rings will be compared with lake sediment records where the proxies overlap temporally to calibrate the sediment record and improve interpretations further into the past.<br/><br/>The results of this project will be relevant to management efforts in the forests where the study is conducted, and they will provide a number of longer-term benefits. First, the project will investigate the potential use of proxy records to reconstruct past mountain pine beetle outbreaks. Second, the project will provide a new method of pollen analysis that includes comparisons between instrumental and dendrochronological reconstructions of climate. The calibration of relationships between pollen and reconstructed climate from tree rings for approximately the last 1,000 years will strengthen inferences of climate conditions for periods of time for which instrumental and dendrochronological data are not available. Third, the results will be used to analyze forest successional dynamics following mountain pine beetle outbreaks and provide information regarding how vegetation composition may shift as a result of mountain pine beetle infestations. In addition to contributing to the science of beetle outbreaks, forest succession and climate controls, there will be direct management applications as a result of the research. The study will identify the linkages between mountain pine beetle outbreaks and summer climate conditions that can be used to better inform management personnel charged with developing plans for forest sustainability in the face of a changing climate. Whitebark pine is a keystone species in these ecosystems and is currently facing a number of threats including potential increases in mountain pine beetle activity. Understanding how climate, vegetation, and mountain pine beetles interact at long time scales will provide managers with critical information to develop management plans that could mitigate the deleterious impacts of a changing climate. The investigators will make the results accessible by working closely with resource managers throughout the study so that the managers are aware of the research as it progresses and can use significant findings in a timely manner.

Actually, highly available data storage for high end computing is becoming increasingly more critical as high-end computing systems scale up in size. To achieve high availability storage systems, a challenging issue is to characterize the availability metric in addition to performance of these systems.<br/><br/>This research investigates high-availability data and I/O services and benchmarking. The investigators take an organized approach to developing a benchmarking framework to measure the storage performance in consideration of availability under various faulty conditions. The research involves four tasks: 1) develop faults/errors model and design fault injection schemes for storage systems; 2) develop an innovative benchmarking framework for high availability distributed storage systems under different faulty conditions; 3) implement an Availability and Performance Evaluation Toolset (APET) to integrate the fault injection and stress testing libraries and capture raw performance of storage systems at block level under various faults; 4) validate the benchmarking framework using APET for block-level storage systems.<br/><br/>This research has direct contributions to understanding highly available data and I/O services for HEC systems, establishing a general benchmarking framework for characterizing storage systems under faulty conditions, and thus benefiting the society by guiding develop high-availability oriented distributed storage systems which are crucial to many applications.

High power lasers with short pulses and broad spectral bandwidths were developed for use studying atomic and molecular dynamics and continuous lasers with very narrow bandwidths were developed and used in high-resolution spectroscopy. The frequency comb technique - invented by Hall and Hansch and recognized by the 2005 Physics Nobel prize - brought the paths back together and opened new opportunities for precision spectroscopy and dynamics experiments, the theme of this project. The frequency-comb technique allows production of laser pulses that consist of only a few optical cycles with the phase being precisely controlled, or equivalently a set of closely spaced colors with precisely defined frequency. The technique enables control of the temporal evolution of the laser field with sub-cycle precision thus giving access to the attosecond time domain. The attosecond (a billionth of a billionth of a second) time domain is the natural time scale of electron motion in atoms and molecules. Therefore, attosecond illumination makes it possible to take snapshots of electron dynamics, e.g. in chemical reactions. Only very recently has it become possible to generate attosecond laser pulses, a development of fundamental importance for atomic and molecular physics, for chemistry and for biology.<br/><br/>This project will develop a versatile phase-coherent laser system that will enable research and education in attosecond laser physics at Texas A&M University. The core of this system will consist of a high-power chirped-pulse optical parametric amplifier capable of generating phase-stabilized few-cycle pulses in the infrared (IR) spectral region. Such pulses will serve as probes in strong-field laser physics experiments. Furthermore, they will allow production of isolated attosecond pulses of extreme ultraviolet (XUV) radiation which are perfectly synchronized with the driving optical field. Simultaneous availability of phase-stabilized few-cycle IR pulses and synchronized XUV pulses will provide capabilities for exploring the attosecond dynamics of molecular dissociation and molecular alignment. In addition, various ideas exploiting unique properties of molecules vibrating and rotating in lockstep will be tested. The system will serve as a valuable resource to a large number of Texas A&M science and engineering faculty and students.<br/><br/>The project will offer excellent training opportunities to graduate and undergraduate students, and will train the workforce necessary for the countless applications of phase-coherent laser systems, XUV technology, and ultra-fast optics in general. The planned collaborations with leading scientists in the US and Europe will provide the students with valuable international experience. The results of this project will be disseminated through scientific publications, colloquia, and conference presentations by faculty and students. Outreach activities such as summer schools, lecture series, science-themed days will be used to promote the project, attract the best students, and inform the interested public.
0707691	The Role in Interstellar Dust Production by Type II Supernovae and Red Supergiants	AST	STELLAR ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSC	08/01/2007	08/02/2007	Geoffrey Clayton	LA	Louisiana State University & Agricultural and Mechanical College	Standard Grant	Maria Womack	07/31/2011	$289,917.00		gclayton@fenway.phys.lsu.edu	202 Himes Hall	Baton Rouge	LA	708032701	2255782760	MPS	1215	0000, 1206, 1207, 9150, OTHR	$0.00	Observations of primordial (redshift greater than five) galaxies have shown that they contain large amounts of dust. The stars in these galaxies are young (ages less than one billion years), so the dust cannot be attributed to asymptotic giant branch stars or Type Ia supernovae, both of which take longer to develop/evolve to dust producing stages. However, dust produced by massive stars (red supergiants and Type II supernovae) may explain the high dust content of these galaxies. Yet very little is known about dust formation in these objects. This three-year project will attempt to characterize the dust produced by massive stars in the local universe and, in particular, address the key question as to whether the Type II supernovae and red supergiant stars alone could produce the amount of dust seen in primordial galaxies.<br/><br/>Here, moderate resolution spectra of large samples of red supergiants in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds with near- and mid-infrared photometry will be modeled to reveal their underlying spectral energy distribution and wavelength dependent reddening. A significant sample of late-time observations (spectra and photometry) of type II supernovae will also be compiled and the amount and nature of the dust production by these objects will be determined. The composition, size distribution, extinction, and re-emission properties of this dust will be studied using Monte Carlo radiative transfer codes, maximum entropy, and multilayer sphere methods. These results are expected to advance our knowledge of the role supernovae and red supergiants play, via dust production and distribution, in the formation and evolution of the first galaxies formed after the big bang. <br/><br/>As these results will have a broad impact in the wider astronomical community, the data and models will be made publicly available on a website. This program will be useful in planning observations for future instruments such as The Atacama Large Millimeter Array and the James Webb Space Telescope. Among the high priority science goals of these telescopes is the detailed study of high-redshift galaxies and their dust content. Both a postdoctoral researcher and a graduate student will be trained through this project. Discussion of this research on dust will also be included in Dr. Clayton''s team-taught astronomy/science fiction course at the LSU Learning Community.

There are many concerns related to privacy in this scenario because people and their activities will be monitored all the time. For example, data collected for temperature monitoring in an office should not be used to imply the presence of a person, which is a private information; unauthorized person should not be allowed to access the sensed data that is privacy-sensitive. To make the sensor network deployment more realistic in our daily life, it is imperative to consider the privacy concerns in sensor networks. <br/><br/>This project aims to build a privacy-preserving infrastructure for sensor networks. It considers the privacy breaches due to the information leakage to (1) untrusted sensor networks, (2) untrusted users, and (3) outside observers. In the context of the three adversary models, this project focuses on the most important operations in sensor networks: data query, data sharing, and data routing. Specifically, the problems addressed in the project include how to store data or aggregate data so that data query can be responded in a privacy-preserving fashion, how to provide security primitives to prevent unauthorized users from accessing collected data, and how to design routing algorithms to preserve location privacy. <br/><br/>The research conducted in this project is expected to deepen our understanding in building a privacy preserving sensor network, and provide a realistic implementation suite for security and privacy support for sensor networks.

The array will be deployed on the James Clerk Maxwell telescope and the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory, and would eventually be deployed on the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment telescope in Chile in 2008. The project will involve several undergraduate and graduate students, and involves collaborations with other institutions and with industry and national research centers.

This technique is particularly useful in the investigation of such species because basic molecular properties can be directly extracted from the spectra. The molecules of interest are almost entirely free radicals and molecular ions, and fall into four classes: (1) metal monomethyl neutral and cationic species including the metals nickel, manganese, and iron, (2) early 3d metal cyanides/isocyanides where the metal is titanium, vanadium, or scandium, (3) metal monocarbonyl radicals and associated ions, and (4) metal oxide clusters, such as the cations of FeO and MnO. These molecules are of fundamental interest for catalysis, C-H/C-C bond activation reactions, and biochemical systems.<br/><br/>Transition metals play a wide and varied role in modern chemistry, including organic and inorganic synthesis, industrial catalysis, materials science, and in biomedical sciences. Despite their ubiquitous presence in both industrial and academic sectors, the chemistry of transition metals is far from understood. This research project will lead to new knowledge about transition metals and molecules that could impact numerous applications such as catalyst design. Students who work on this project are being educated in experimental techniques in physical chemistry, and being prepared for challenging technical careers.

Combustion control systems can be based on non-intrusive in-situ measurement using passive optical probes that measure spectrally-resolved radiation from specific molecular products (H2O, CO, and CO2) in the hot flow field. Concentrations and temperatures can be directly determined from the observed spectral structure. The critical innovation in this proposal is the experimental determination of the functional relationship using spectral sensor technology and tomographic reconstruction techniques. Flow field characterization is achieved using a large number of measurements over multiple lines of sight through the flow. <br/><br/>The proposed Phase II research lays the scientific ground work for active control systems for a range of multi-burner combustors, including turbine engines, boilers, and process burners. These applications represent more than 50% of the global fossil energy usage; thus improvements in efficiency can have a major economic and societal impact. The proposed innovation is just one of the component technologies required for the development of active control systems, but it is an enabling component, with potential application in all industrial combustion markets

Because it can be argued that calcifying fauna are particularly vulnerable to these changes in ocean chemistry, coral reef ecosystems have received much recent scrutiny in this regard. It may, however, be equally important to similarly study high-latitude ecosystems because the low temperatures of those regions negatively affect calcification and enhance the uptake of atmospheric CO2. Thus, attempts to understand the effects of CO2 increase and ocean acidification on marine faunas would reasonably target both tropical reef and shallow-water, high-latitude taxa. <br/><br/>One way to determine the response of such marine fauna to elevated pCO2 is to perform experiments where the carbonate system is manipulated and monitored while other environmental parameters are held constant. The overall goal of this project is to determine through such experimentation if the predicted increase in surface ocean pCO2, associated with observed and predicted increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide, will be lethal to benthic foraminifera. This protistan taxon is selected mainly because it includes calcifying and noncalcifying forms and is ubiquitous at all latitudes. To address regional effects of ocean acidification, experimentation will include foraminiferal species from high latitude, temperate, and tropical shallow benthic environments; the sites include a Swedish fjord, a sediment-focus area on the continental slope off Cape Cod, and a Florida coral reef. <br/><br/>The broader impacts include developing integrated studies to assess regional responses to elevated pCO2 and ocean acidification useful for predictions of future ecosystem dynamics. In addition, this project, which includes investigators from WHOI, the University of South Florida, and Gˆteborg University (Sweden), has multiple avenues for education to graduate and undergraduate students, as well as local high school students.

However, little is known about using this data effectively and efficiently within their decision-making processes, which can often be modeled as multi-stage stochastic optimization problems. In many application domains, such as supply chain management and revenue management, these give rise to complex problems, where the decision in each stage must be made under uncertainty about the future evolution of an underlying stochastic process. Traditional approaches to these problems assume that the uncertainty is defined through explicitly specified probability distributions that are known a priori; the knowledge of these distributions is crucial to the development of the corresponding optimization algorithms. However, in most practical situations the exact distributions are not known, and only historical data is available. This research project aims to develop a general-purpose sampling-based algorithmic framework for these models that, unlike traditional approaches, uses the raw historical data as the source of samples. First, we plan to develop sampling-based algorithmic approaches to approximately solve complex stochastic dynamic programming formulations, the dominant paradigm used for these problems. Second, we focus on sampling-based algorithms for models that combine optimization and learning simultaneously. A common theme between these two research thrusts, and a central feature of our research project, is the development of explicit quantitative analysis of the performance of our algorithms that provide guarantees on the sample-size needed to assure a specified error bound with respect to optimal solution for the true underlying probability distribution.<br/><br/>Consider a firm like Amazon that provides millions of different items to customers throughout the US. Clearly, it is important for the company to have the inventory that its customers want, since if an item is out of stock, then the customer is likely to purchase the item from elsewhere. On the other hand, maintaining extra inventory for undesired items has the disadvantage of tying up capital in obtaining them, using significant resources in warehousing this supply, which is further compounded by the risk of perishability and obsolesce. If one had a crystal ball with which one could predict the future, then the company could know how many requests there will be, day by day, for each of the items it sells, and therefore know how much of what should be on hand in each of its warehouses. Instead, one can model the future probabilistically (similar to what a weather forecaster does when saying that there is a 40% chance of showers tomorrow), and then one can cast the problem of making the optimal decisions for these inventory levels as a problem of maximizing the average profit that can be obtained (or minimizing the average costs incurred), where the notion of average is with respect to the randomness used to model our inability to exactly predict the future. This project has the goal of using past historical data as a means for modeling the predictions for future data, and then designing algorithms that produce provably near-optimal decisions based on this approximation. This type of decision-making in the face of uncertainty arises in a wide range of application domains, from selling different classes of airline<br/>tickets for a portfolio of flight legs to manufacturing a suite of products that rely on overlapping sets of components. This project focuses on settings in which there are multiple stages of decision-making that must be made in the face of an evolving view of the predictions of future<br/>requirements. The aim is to provide tools to automate such decision-making with algorithms that are guaranteed to quickly produce reliable solutions.
0720935	Doctoral Dissertation Research: A Theory and Experimental Test of Collective Action Participation	SES	SOCIOLOGY	08/01/2007	08/10/2007	Shane Thye	SC	University South Carolina Research Foundation	Standard Grant	Patricia White	07/31/2008	$5,009.00		srthye@sc.edu	1600 Hampton Street	COLUMBIA	SC	292080001	8037777093	SBE	1331	9179, SMET	$0.00	SES-0720935<br/>Shane Thye<br/>Christine Witkowski<br/>University of South Carolina<br/><br/>Collective problems are pervasive features of social life that compromise health and well-being on many levels. Familiar examples include HIV/AIDs, terrorism, collapsing fisheries, avian flu, rainforest destruction, and global climate change. Unfortunately, motivating people to get involved in collective problem solving, otherwise known as collective action (CA), can be difficult. Despite efforts by scholars to shed light on when and why an individual will decide to participate in collective problem solving, the scientific community still lacks sufficient knowledge about when cognitive support for CA leads to actual participation in that CA. Building on earlier theories and capitalizing upon foundational social psychological insights, this study addresses this issue by offering a new theory that answers the question why do some individuals respond to a call to action that seeks to involve them in collective problem solving while others do not? Data will be collected through a laboratory experiment at the University of South Carolina Laboratory for Sociological Research. <br/><br/>The centerpiece of the PIs' theory asserts that an appeal for CA that is consistent with an individual's existing beliefs is more likely to be perceived as credible, is more likely to be supported intellectually and emotionally, and is more likely to lead to actual participation. The investigators incorporate these ideas into a single theoretical framework and propose new research to test core ideas of this theory. Specifically, a new laboratory experiment is designed to determine whether consistency between a CA appeal and an individual's preexisting beliefs is a necessary condition for message credibility, cognitive support, and actual participation in the CA. In the experiment, the PIs first evaluate the subjects' beliefs then administer a CA appeal that is either consistent or inconsistent with those beliefs. Subjects then evaluate the credibility of the message, indicate their level of cognitive support for the CA, and decide whether or not to actually participate in the CA. This work combines a number of existing ideas about CA participation into a succinct theoretical framework that can be tested, thus allowing the investigators to fill a gap in the social scientific understanding of how people are compelled to become engaged in collective problem solving. <br/><br/>This project will deepen our understanding of when and why people choose to participate in CA. A key theoretical contribution is the bridging of the gap between existing explanations of CA with an eye toward a broader and more integrative model. Additionally, the investigators will train and provide research experience to female and minority students (both graduate and undergraduate) in the Laboratory for Sociological Research. An understanding of when and why people choose to become involved in CA would benefit scientists and practitioners alike. The former include students of sociology, social psychology, social marketing, persuasion and communication; the latter include organizers and policy makers working for NGOs, government organizations, and corporations striving to mobilize CA. Participation in collective problem solving is needed to disentangle world-wide problems such as the HIV/AIDs epidemic, widespread ecological devastation, global climate change, and the growth of malicious political regimes or terrorist organizations that threaten public health, safety, and security.

A nerve cell growth conduit fashioned from FDA approved, biodegradable poly(caprolactone) (PCL) will be modified on the inner surface with various peptides to test the hypothesis that the incorporation of a polypeptide that has shown preferential Schwann cell adhesion over fibroblast adhesion in vitro may improve nerve regeneration in vivo. Schwann cells play important roles in peripheral nerve regeneration, including delivery of cytokines and growth factors, whereas fibroblasts may induce scarring and inhibit nerve growth. The inner surface of the guide will be coated with synthetic peptides, i.e., laminin-derived arg-gly-asp (RGD) and poly(L-lysine) (PLL) known to promote Schwann cell adhesion. The effectiveness of the surface-modified guides will be assessed in vivo using a 1.5 cm sciatic nerve defect in a Lewis rat model.<br/><br/>BROADER IMPACTS: An improved guide for nerve cell regeneration could have important consequences for the 200,000 cases per year in the US where interventions for peripheral nerve injuries are required. In too many cases today the regeneration is so slow that the target muscle has atrophied before the nerve is reconnected. The PI will continue her practice of involving women and under represented minority graduate and undergraduate students in her research group. She will also continue to run the Research Opportunities for High School Students program (ROHSS), which she initiated in 2003 and which is geared toward female high school students. It is proposed now to enhance this program and extend it to an 8-week summer session. The PI involves her graduate students in this effort in order to encourage them to give back to the community as they pursue their own independent careers. The PI has also formed the Pittsburgh Biomaterials Group which is sponsored by the McGowan Institute for Regenerative Medicine. This group includes over 50 of the biomaterials researchers in the area. It meets monthly, and the ROHSS participants are invited to these meetings.

The investigators, as well as others, have observed these waves of Ca2+ release in neuronal dendrites experimentally, and these detailed cellular models will be used to replicate the waves, investigate their function, and make predictions for future experiments. The key novel aspect of this work is linking the nonlinear dynamics of the intracellular signaling pathways to the electrical behavior of the neuron. This represents a fundamental shift because changes related to intracellular signaling have largely been implemented as static parameter changes in past neurocomputational models. Detailed biophysical models will enable the investigators to test whether the internal neuronal biochemistry can function to alter integration properties of cortical neurons and whether these intracellular processes can affect the behavior of networks of neurons.<br/><br/>The problem of intracellular Ca2+ signaling in neurons has immediate relevance for understanding mechanisms of plasticity and for understanding disease processes that are known to involve malfunctions of intracellular signaling pathways. Reusable tools will be crafted for the NEURON general-purpose simulator that will allow others to extend widely different neural models with intracellular signaling mechanisms and explore a variety of related problems. In terms of broader impact, the project will bring together the fields of computational neuroscience and computational cell biology - communities that do not currently overlap a great deal - in order to start to investigate the many aspects the function of neurons not currently addressed by theoretical neuroscience.

There has never been a large-scale meeting of the world's experts to discuss the questions, evidence, and methods for deducing their phylogeny (evolutionary relationships) or their relationships to other crustacean groups. This project will support a meeting to address this oversight by assembling a large and diverse gathering of specialists. The meeting stems from a previously-awarded NSF Tree of Life grant and is part of the Society of Integrative and Comparative Biology annual meeting (2008. San Antonio). <br/><br/>Because of the diversity of the decapods, their ecological and economic significance, and their popularity with the public, this meeting and workshop will have an impact far greater than elucidating relationships among the many groups of crabs, shrimps, and lobsters. It will be widely attended by students, some of whom will be co-authoring presentations. Invited specialists include females and minorities representing 12 nations. The resulting publication will be a major source of information for future students of crustaceans and will be of great value to marine biologists, resource managers, teachers, and anyone with an interest in marine biology in general and arthropod relationships in particular.
0726806	Doctoral Dissertation Research: Magnitude and Spatial-Temporal Variability of Methane Sinks in a Seasonally Stratified, Eutrophic Northern Temperate Lake	BCS	GEOGRAPHY AND SPATIAL SCIENCES	08/01/2007	08/09/2007	Harold Hemond	MA	Massachusetts Institute of Technology	Standard Grant	Thomas J.

Methane also is an important component of the carbon cycle in the earth's water bodies. The goal of this doctoral dissertation research project is to measure the magnitude, rate, and spatial distribution of methane that is lost to the atmosphere as opposed to that lost to oxidation by micoorganisms in a freshwater lake. Quantifying methane processes in natural waters is difficult because of the patchy and transient nature of production, emission, and consumption. One hypothesis to be tested during this project is that bubbling -- a spatially and temporally heterogenous process -- is the major mode of methane release to the atmosphere from the bottom of the lake. The doctoral candidate will use modern sensor technology to obtain continuous measurements of methane bubbling. Custom-made conical chambers will be used to capture the bubbles and will be deployed at various locations in the lake. The chambers will be equipped with pressure sensors and infra-red based sensors to continuously measure the volume of gas that is collected and the average concentration of methane present in the bubbles. Software will be developed to analyze the data to detect and record major ebullition events. In addition, water samples will be collected via a syringe-based sampling device, and the methane present in the samples will be analyzed using gas chromatography. The samples also will be used to test the extent of methane oxidation at various lake depths through incubation experiments. In order to provide a context for the above measurements, ancillary data such as water quality parameters (e.g. water temperature, dissolved oxygen), atmospheric conditions (e.g. air temperature, air pressure) and major ions (e.g. sulfate, nitrate) will also be collected. The primary field site for this project is the methane-rich Upper Mystic Lake in Woburn, Massachusetts.<br/><br/>The release of methane to the atmosphere not only affects the planetary radiation budget; it also represents a loss of carbon, reducing power, and energy from aquatic ecosystems. The amount of methane currently emitted from water bodies, and freshwater lakes in particular, is thought to be greatly underestimated due to the lack of continuity in measurement techniques used in prior methane studies. The results of this research will help bridge existing gaps in the methane-driven component of global warming. Such knowledge is essential in formulating public policies on climate change mitigation that appropriately prioritize management efforts. Because methane in lakes could represent a locally useful alternate source of fuel; an enhanced comprehension of methane processes would help determine the feasibility of harvesting this fuel as a benign source of power for surrounding areas. As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.

Princeton	NJ	085442020	6092583090	CSE	7354	7354, 9218, HPCC	$0.00	Emerging nanodevices, such as carbon nanotubes, have been recognized as very promising for future technology scaling. A recent innovation has enabled the fabrication of nanotube-based non-volatile random-access memory (NRAM) that has the promise to become a universal memory. NRAMs are suitable for both standalone and embedded memory applications and are fabricated using traditional lithography-compatible manufacturing processes. An NRAM is considerably faster and denser than DRAM, has much lower power consumption than DRAM or flash, has similar speed to SRAM and is highly resistant to environmental forces (temperature, magnetism).<br/><br/>The aim of this project is to explore an NRAM-based class of programmable computer architectures, known as a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) family. Initial work in the PI's group on such FPGAs has shown the feasibility of increasing the logic density by over an order of magnitude compared to traditional FPGAs, using the novel concept of fine-grain temporal logic folding, which makes cycle-by-cycle dynamic reconfiguration feasible.<br/><br/>The objectives of this project include design space exploration of the NRAM-based FPGA space using a parameterized technology mapping and temporal logic folding tool that takes a mixed register-transfer/gate level description of a circuit and maps it to an NRAM-based FPGA family instance. The research will also explore the applicability of such FPGAs to computation-unit integrated memories for memory-intensive multimedia applications.<br/><br/>The proposed work will make a well-characterized and highly versatile family of NRAM-based FPGAs and associated mapper/folder available to industry. The material will be included in a new senior-level course on Design with Nanotechnologies. Undergraduate students are expected to participate in this research. Female and minority students will be attracted to this research through Princeton's Presidential Fellowship Program.

In this project, researchers at the University of Alaska at Fairbanks will be funded to participate in the May-June 2008 and in the June 2009 GEOTRACES intercalibration cruises in the Sargasso Sea and the North Pacific. During the May-June 2008 cruise, this principal investigator and his colleagues intend to compare their custom-built ATE/Vane iron sampler to the GEOTRACES sampling system and other water samplers for the contamination-free sampling of dissolved, colloidal and particulate trace metals. During the June 2009 cruise, this project will investigate sample storage procedures for Fe-binding organic ligands that minimize storage artifacts by providing on-board measurements of unfrozen freshly collected seawater samples and time series measurements of preserved samples. The sampler comparison studies will help establish ?default? sampling procedures for the US GEOTRACES program. The sample storage method studies will provide confidence to carry out a global survey of trace element speciation during the GEOTRACES program. These proposed works are critical for the success of the GEOTRACES intercalibration cruises and comply with the major goals of GEOTRACES project. <br/><br/>The proposed is expected to have broader impacts that extend beyond the international GEOTRACES program. It should provide important new insights for a variety of research activities that endeavor to understand the roles of oceanic trace element geochemical cycling in regulating marine ecosystem and the oceanic carbon cycle. Such understanding will help predict changes in natural oceanic environments and global climate due to human activities, and will help in the proper management of current and future marine resources. In addition, the proposed studies of sampler comparison and sample storage procedures, during the intercalibration cruises, will help develop proper methods for large scale trace elements sampling in the global ocean which will advance the field of oceanography in general.

Trauma is the leading cause of death for Americans under the age of 45. Traumatic pelvic injuries can be fatal due to severe hemorrhage, and care givers treating these injuries need to consider several types of data, including biomedical signals, images, trauma scores, laboratory results, diagnosis/treatment, injury specifics, and demographics during the decision making process. Integrating simple types of data such as lab results and demographics is not easy, but the decision-making process shows its true complexity when trying to integrate more complex types of patient data such as biomedical signals and images. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit<br/>The project is challenging in the following aspects: <br/>o It constructs a traumatic pelvic injury database that includes all relevant biomedical signals/images, trauma scores, lab results, diagnosis, treatment, demographics, and injury specifics for each patient. This database will have two significant advantages over existing databases: 1) it will contain not only patient demographics and trauma scores but also time-series (signals) of physiological measures and images; and 2) in the new database, instead of including only raw data, patient information is processed and transformed into a set of features that can be directly used for decision making. <br/>o A variety of novel biomedical signal and image processing methods will be formed to extract relevant features. These computational methods will include both the improved versions of computational methods in signal and image processing (e.g., segmentation techniques for CT images), and feature extraction methods for specific signals and images (e.g., defining the total area of the pelvic ring captured from CT as a feature). <br/>o The project constructs a rule database where all derived features for patients in the feature database are analyzed with outcomes, resulting in a set of rules to describe logical relationships among the input features and resulting outcomes/recommendations, using non-linear classification and regression tree. The project is novel in its rule validation; besides using typical statistical methods such as cross-validation and measures of sensitivity and specificity used in existing systems, a new statistical framework based on computational learning theory will be used to allow a more comprehensive comparison of the new system with other methods such as neural networks and Bayesian classifiers.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/>This project brings together computer scientists with trauma experts and will produce a system that can be replicated at other hospital systems. This methodology can be used for other types of trauma cases, such as brain injuries. Educationally, project results will be included in regular seminars to teach healthcare providers across the spectrum of the trauma care the latest techniques used in trauma care. The PI will align the research project with undergraduate and graduate research and outreach activities managed by the University of North Carolina at Charlotte''s Diversity in IT Institute, whose mission is to increase enrollment and retention of women and underrepresented groups within IT with a focus on facilitating graduate and undergraduate interdisciplinary programs, and two NSF-funded programs housed within the institute: 1) The Students & Technology in Academia, Research, and Service Alliance: A Southeastern Partnership for Broadening Participation in Computing, and 2) Computing Research for Undergraduates.

However, the distinct communication capabilities of these technologies present significant barriers for interoperability and migration between different network infrastructures. Network assimilation is necessary to bridge the gap between the infrastructure networks and the diversity of end-user communication devices. This research investigates a software-defined radio (SDR) solution to support concurrent execution of multiple communication systems on a single SDR platform, which functions as the base station, through hardware and software reconfiguration. The research challenges to be addressed at the physical layer and the networking layer of the SDR platforms include: (i) reconfigurable and adaptive architectures based on field programmable gate array (FPGA) technology to change the communication capabilities of the SDR platform; (ii) concurrent and time-shared execution of multiple communication systems on a single SDR platform; and (iii) mobility context definition and transfer to support seamless mobility. The project contributes to the state-of-the-art of SDR architecture, proposes new mechanisms for dynamic reconfiguration of SDR platforms, advances the protocol engineering research for wireless mesh networks with reconfigurable SDRs, and provides new approaches to supporting seamless mobility in mobile networks.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: The reconfigurable base stations have potential application to civil disaster situations and the investigators will seek collaborations with industry and related research to increase impact. Aspects of the research involving hardware devices and software packages for running tests on SDR systems provide an opportunity for students to conduct experiments and learn about the next generation of wireless network technologies. Results will also be incorporated into a new project-oriented graduate course on adaptive wireless communication and architecture.
0733612	Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant: Estimating Midewiwin Antiquity with AMS Radiocarbon Dates from Canadian Shield Rock Paintings	BCS	ARCHAEOLOGY	08/01/2007	08/07/2009	Christopher Carr	AZ	Arizona State University	Standard Grant	John E. Yellen	07/31/2010	$15,000.00		christopher.carr@asu.edu	ORSPA	TEMPE	AZ	852816011	4809655479	SBE	1391	1391, 9179, SMET	$0.00	Under the supervision of Dr. Christopher Carr, William R. Weeks will examine the origins of the Midewiwin. The Midewiwin is the traditional medicine society of the Anishinaabeg?the good-hearted native people of northeastern North America. According to Anishinaabeg traditions, the Midewiwin is an ancient ancestral institution that continues to ensure the well-being of the people to this day. However, the prevalent anthropological view, derived largely from ethnohistory, maintains that the Midewiwin originated during the colonial period as a revitalization movement. <br/><br/>The antiquity of the Midewiwin is uncertain from an archaeological perspective. Archaeologists have discovered prehistoric artifacts and features around the Great Lakes that share similarities with the historic Midewiwin, but most are rare and ambiguous in that they may be attributed to widespread forms of Algonquian ceremonialism. Methodologically novel to Mr. Weeks's research is the systematic identification of images that are diagnostic of the Midewiwin. These signs have been used to identify 37 rock painting sites in the Canadian Shield where Midewiwin ceremonies were likely performed. These sites are not yet dated, although most are assumed to be late prehistoric in age. This project will estimate the age of five key Midewiwin rock painting sites with AMS radiocarbon dates derived from small samples of organic material in the paint or associated, bracketing mineral deposits. The organic materials will be extracted from the paints using plasma-chemical oxidation or from the deposits employing micro-excavation.<br/><br/>Archaeological research on Midewiwin origins holds strong promise for making substantial contributions to anthropological knowledge, method, and theory. This project, as the first major effort to radiocarbon date Midewiwin rock paintings, offers the opportunity to explore whether the institution had early, pre-contact origins, and how the Anishinaabeg may have altered it socially, politically, and religiously over time in response to colonial challenges. Through this detailed case study, general models of how cultural contact, change, and revitalization unfold can be contextualized, scrutinized, and elaborated. In addition, the dating of Midewiwin rock paintings will allow investigation of the history of migration of the Anishinaabeg as told by their ancestral oral and graphic traditions, and thereby encourage professional anthropologists, archaeologists, and scientists alike in their sensitivity to native bodies of knowledge.<br/><br/>Central to the broad impacts of this research for professional anthropology are the integration and participation of native North American peoples who are underrepresented in academic institutions, particularly in the practice of archaeology. Mr. Weeks is Cherokee and this award will assist in his graduate training. Further, this project involves cooperative work with Anishinaabeg communities in the U.S. and Canada, including the conducting of archaeological fieldwork, interpreting results, developing educational workshops for native youths, and presenting findings at professional conferences. One of the major goals of this research is to inspire future native students to become professional archaeologists, who will enhance educational institutions with their culturally diverse insights.

Brown	08/31/2008	$100,000.00		douglas.hanes@gmail.com	Clinical Research & Technology C	Portland	OR	972322003	5034132362	SBE	7252	0000, OTHR	$0.00	As a person walks on a sidewalk or drives down a street, he or she detects optic flow that informs of the speed and direction of movement, as well as the distances of objects in the environment. Unlike a viewer looking down from above, who would see the person as moving through a fixed environment, the moving person sees objects in the visual field expand as they are approached, or move off to the side as they are passed. Using this flow to sense and control one's own movement might appear to be a difficult computational problem, and yet people still do it all the time. The visual system does have help, though; in particular, the vestibular system, with its acceleration sensors in the inner ear, detects the directions of rotations and translations of the head independently of vision. Having some redundancy between the two types of sensors is a good thing, because both are subject to errors, and because the two are effective at sensing different types of movements. A major issue is to understand how the visual and vestibular senses work together in sensing and controlling the body's motion through the environment. While each sense has been heavily studied on its own, how they fit together has received relatively little attention, at least for translational movement through a natural environment.<br/><br/>With funding from the National Science Foundation, Dr. Douglas Hanes will begin to address the processes by which visual and vestibular signals together inform about self-motion. The focus of his work will be on mathematically modeling the optimal integration of visual and vestibular information in the central nervous system. It is known that visual signals associated with a rotation of the head?the global flow on the retina in a direction opposite to head or eye rotations?converge with vestibular signals for the same head rotation in movement centers of the brain. Understanding a similar convergence for translational motion is harder, because the visual flow that results is much more complex, and successful modeling of this convergence will require the use of more sophisticated mathematical techniques. By elucidating the ways in which these senses complement one another, and by proposing a specific model of integration, the research will help bring together knowledge from independent research carried out on the visual and vestibular systems. The results should shed light on vexing questions about how humans can estimate distances traveled or trajectories of motion with only one sense or the other, or what happens when the two senses conflict. The results of this work will not only help us better understand multi-sensory function, but will have implications about how problems may arise in the perception and control of self motion while flying or driving.

The proposed research extends previous theory and research in several important ways. Study 1 will experimentally test the specificity of the self-conscious emotion/cortisol association by priming specific emotions (self-conscious emotion and comparison negative emotions) prior to a social-evaluative stressor task. In Study 2, responses to social-evaluative stressors will be assessed both inside and outside of the laboratory (using a standardized social-evaluative stressor in the lab and daily dairy methodology in the field). This will test whether naturally-occurring social-evaluative, rejecting situations elicit self-conscious emotional and cortisol responses (mirroring the laboratory findings). Taken together, the studies will enable us to better understand the specific social contexts capable of eliciting cortisol reactivity (in naturally-occurring situations and in the laboratory), and further elucidate the emotional underpinnings of these physiological changes. Importantly, because consistent, chronic activation of the cortisol system is thought to lead to negative effects on health, repeated activation of the cortisol system ? as may be experienced under chronic social-evaluative threat ? could leave individuals vulnerable to these detrimental health outcomes. It may be that individuals who appraise their social world as rejecting or are particularly sensitive to social rejection could be especially likely to show these negative health effects. Those who experience chronic social-evaluative threat could also demonstrate these health vulnerabilities. The proposed research is important and will highlight important factors (e.g., social-evaluative threat), emotions (e.g., shame and related states), and individuals (i.e., those chronically experiencing social-evaluative situations) to target when designing interventions for stress-related disease.

Temporal and spatial monitoring of the plume concentrations are needed to assess risk, make decisions and take remedial action. Current underground contaminant plume monitoring technologies are inefficient, expensive and ineffective. Wireless sensor technologies have the potential to dramatically improve this process. <br/>A closed-loop system integrating wireless sensor network based monitoring with numerical models for plume tracking is being developed, in which sensor data continuously calibrates and validates the system identification and prediction models, while the output from these models direct the sensor network operation to optimize constraints such as accuracy and power consumption. The system is based on a novel virtual sensor network architecture with broader applicability beyond plume tracking. Algorithms and protocols being developed support the formation, usage, adaptation and maintenance of dynamic subsets of collaborating sensors, named Virtual Sensor Networks (VSNs). VSN protocols for collaboration among groups of sensors will greatly ease the task of deploying sensor networks, especially in environments where multiple geographically overlapping applications are deployed. A proof-of-concept laboratory test bed that captures the complex subsurface processes is used for integration and evaluation of VSN protocols. This interdisciplinary project will significantly advance the state-of-the art in subsurface plume tracking and sensor networking technologies. It will stimulate a unique partnership of electrical engineers, computer scientists and environmental researchers, and demonstrate closed-loop operation of computer models and sensor networks to solve complex environmental problems.

Schaffner	07/31/2008	$11,008.00		eringqui@indiana.edu	509 E 3RD ST	Bloomington	IN	474013654	8128550516	SBE	1371	9179, SMET	$0.00	There is broad consensus that delegating power to supranational organizations increases effectiveness, but diminishes democracy. Operating with delegated power, supranational institutions are bureaucratic in character and potentially unresponsive to citizen preferences. This project examines if it is possible to increase democratic responsiveness within policy making institutions at the transnational level and draws on the experience of the European Union as the most advanced model of transnational governance. In 1994, the EU created the Committee of the Regions, consisting of officials with electoral mandates at local or regional levels to advise the appointed European Commission, to enhance democratic representation. This research tests the effectiveness of this design by examining how much this representative body influences the legislative output of the Commission. Specifically, two linked questions are addressed: 1) how often are public preferences expressed in the Committee's opinions acted upon through incorporation into EU legislation? and 2) what are the conditions that maximize the likelihood of incorporation? The project utilizes an original dataset based on a stratified random sample of 60 legislative proposals. <br/><br/>The Committee of the Regions offers an excellent case for studying the potential to facilitate democratic representation while maintaining technocratic effectiveness. The fact that all its members are elected makes the Committee of the Regions responsive to voters' preferences. The formal legislative procedure mandates that the Commission consult the Committee of the Regions on all legislative proposals that have effects at the regional or local level. Upon obtaining the Committee opinion, the Commission issues a final proposal that goes for approval to the two-house legislature consisting of European Council and European Parliament. Given the way the legislative process works, the final Commission proposals, in practice, become European law. To assess whether public preferences influence the legislative process in the EU, this research measures the changes between initial and final proposals of the European Commission and compares these changes with the comments in the Committee opinion. <br/><br/>The broader impact of this work lies in its focus on fundamental questions of democracy and bureaucratic responsiveness. By examining if it is possible to inject responsiveness into administrative decision making in supranational organizations, this research develops a set of expectations to guide both scholars and citizens on how to achieve effective and more responsive administration. The findings, therefore, have implications not only for the EU, but they should have implications for all forms of supranational governance.

Enabling Very Long Baseline Interferometry at higher frequencies would provide for greater angular resolution, which in turn would provide for observations of unprecedented detail of various important science targets, including the center of the Milky Way Galaxy. The technology can be deployed at worldwide sites used for Very Long Baseline Interferometry, and could be deployed at future large millimeter wave telescopes, including the Atacama Large Millimeter Array.

The instrument will be capable of depositing a variety of materials, including organic semiconductors, functionalized proteins, and polymeric materials. The work will build on a recent discovery that by directing the crystallization of thin film materials laterally across the surface of a substrate, crystalline domain sizes larger than one millimeter can be obtained for a variety of organic semiconductor materials. The large grain sizes represent a several order-of-magnitude improvement over commonly used techniques. Single crystal films have much lower defect densities than polycrystalline films, and exhibit improved electronic and mechanical properties. Thus, the goal of several research projects that will use this new instrument will be to correlate structural ordering of new materials with electrical, optical, and mechanical properties. The materials to be studied initially have applications in the areas of organic electronics, organic photovoltaics, synthetic collagen, and biocompatible materials that could be used for stents. The capability to easily fabricate highly ordered thin films of new materials will enable rapid progress in both fundamental studies of materials and the development of new materials for applications in the areas mentioned above.<br/><br/>Non-technical abstract<br/>This project is to develop a system that implements a new inexpensive method for writing patterns of carbon-based soft materials with a high degree of alignment of the molecules making up the material. The ordering arrangement of molecules has a large influence on the properties of the materials and hence the suitability for practical applications. The new instrument will allow research on how certain types of molecular ordering influence properties of materials that might make them suitable for forming electronic switches, or to generate electricity from light. The instrument will produce a much higher degree of ordering than conventional methods, and will therefore assist in the development of materials for bright inexpensive displays, as well as for highly efficient carbon-based solar cells as a source of electricity. Other materials that will be investigated have applications as synthetic strands of the material that give skin its elastic properties, and as bio-compatible materials that can be used for hold blocked arteries open to allow blood to flow freely. The crucial capability to easily fabricate highly ordered thin films of a broad range of materials will enable rapid progress in both fundamental studies and advanced applications in the areas mentioned above.

Typical examples of identities include your name and your social-security number, or your fingerprint/iris-scan, or your address, or your (non-revoked) Public-Key coming from some trusted public-key infrastructure. In many situations, however, where you are defines your identity. For example, we know the role of a bank-teller behind a bullet-proof bank window not because he or she shows us her<br/>credentials but by merely knowing her location. In this proposal, we ask the following question: is it possible to have the geographical position of a party take part in defining the set of credentials<br/>she has? What are the new possibilities in terms of what we can achieve in this setting?<br/><br/>First, we propose to consider the central task in this setting, i.e.,<br/>securely verifying the position of a device. Despite much work in this area, we have preliminary results that show that in the vanilla (i.e., standard) model, the above task (i.e., of secure<br/>positioning) is impossible to achieve.<br/><br/>We propose to study the proof of position in the bounded storage model (i.e. where we assume some bound on the total memory of the adversary).<br/>In this setting, we wish to achieve two tasks: secure positioning, and position-based key exchange. While the question of secure positioning has been asked in the past, no satisfactory answers exist. <br/><br/>The second question (of position-based key exchange) has not been asked in the past. We also ask a broader question: whether position-based Secure Multi-Party Computation can be achieved in this setting.

In recent years, the idea of the model-based design paradigm is to develop design models and subject them to early analysis, testing, and validation prior to their implementation. Simulation-based testing ensures that a finite number of user-defined system trajectories meet the desired specification. Even though computationally inexpensive simulation is ubiquitous in system design, it suffers from incompleteness, as it is impossible or impractical to test all system trajectories. On the other hand, verification methods enjoy completeness by showing that all system trajectories satisfy the desired property. For embedded hybrid systems with an infinite number of possible behaviors, exhaustive verification seems to be very hard, and simulation-based testing seems to provide no confidence in our system design. In addition to the gap between testing and verification for embedded systems, there is even a more fundamental, and largely unaddressed, challenge. Uncertainty in the environment, errors in physical devices make overall system robustness one of most critical yet least understood challenges in embedded systems. There is a clear intellectual opportunity for laying the scientific foundations and developing methods and algorithms for analyzing and testing the robustness and safety of embedded hybrid systems. This project brings together leading experts in embedded control, hybrid systems, and software monitoring and testing to develop the foundations of a modern framework for testing the robustness of embedded hybrid systems. The central idea that this proposal is centered around is the notion of a robust test, where the robustness of nominal test can be computed and used to infer that a tube of trajectories around the nominal test will yield the same qualitative behavior. By computing the robustness margins of tests, this project explores how to infer how robust each test is, guide subsequent tests, estimate the robustness for the system, as well provide well-defined coverage metrics using finite number of tests. In addition, this project emphasizes cross-cutting, multi-departmental education of graduate students and emphasizes testing and robustness for embedded hybrid systems in relevant electrical engineering and computer science courses. The educational agenda is to expose computer science students to notions of robustness, and control students to software testing algorithms.

Thus the geometry of knot complements ought to be a useful tool in the study of knots. However, what is not known in general is how to relate diagrams of knots to their geometric structure, particularly hyperbolic knots. In the last few years, the PI has found bounds on certain geometric information of a knot complement based on a diagram, including bounds on cusp shapes and volumes for classes of knots. <br/>In this project, the PI will apply techniques in 3-manifold theory developed in the last few years to knot complements, to further our understanding of their geometric properties.<br/><br/>A closed loop lying in space may be knotted or unknotted. In mathematics, such a loop is called a knot. One goal of knot theory is to determine, based on a snapshot of that knot (a diagram), whether it can be unknotted without breaking the loop. A method of studying knots is to consider not the knot itself, but the 3-dimensional space obtained by removing the knot from the 3-sphere, called the knot complement. The PI will use recent advances in the study of 3-dimensional spaces, or 3-manifold theory, to study knots. This research has applications to such areas as string theory and the knotting of DNA.

This grant will fund a high performance computational cluster to serve the research needs of a variety of faculty at Smith College. A project in symbolic computation and algebra will use high powered computation to prove conjectures about exceptional Weyl Groups which require significant computation as well as working toward developing a new specialized computer algebra package for Weyl Groups and symmetric spaces. A researcher in computational geometry will use the cluster to search for special configurations of protein backbone polygonal chains, and to generate random geometric objects, in both R2 and R3. A graph theorist will use parallel computing to determine algebraic, geometric, and combinatorial parameters of graphs in order to find examples that show that particular bounds are sharp. A project in dynamical systems and mathematical biology involves intricate image processing for data collecting, computationally costly exploration of high dimensional dynamical systems, as well as optimization of the fit of these models to large data sets. A statistician will use high powered computation to develop likelihood methods for incomplete data in regression models. A project in computational geometry, rigidity and motion simulation will take advantage of parallel processing in an interdisciplinary project with bio-physicists and computational chemists for experimenting with and developing new tools for molecular simulations.<br/><br/><br/>This grant will provide computing power for research projects that span a broad spectrum of mathematics including graph theory, statistics, computational geometry, and symbolic computation. They are both theoretical and applied. Several of the projects involve interdisciplinary work with biologist, physicists, chemists and computer scientists. The possibility of using high-powered computer systems allows us to ask different questions and devise different techniques, thus inherently changing the course of our research. Improving the computational capabilities at Smith College creates a better research environment for the faculty. This is a College known for its ability to engage undergraduate women in research and to send them to graduate school in the mathematical sciences. Thus this grant will enable projects that are sophisticated, highly computational and yet accessible for student work. This will enable Smith undergraduate students (all women), and students at the new Center for Women in Mathematics at Smith to participate in a significant way in a serious research projects in collaboration with Smith faculty.

Drake and Melissa Ziegler<br/><br/>Title: Doctoral Dissertation Research: State-Society Networks and State Capacity in Latin America<br/><br/>0719843<br/><br/>Abstract<br/><br/>The fate of democracy in Latin America depends greatly on state capacity, particularly on the ability of states to collect and redistribute resources to meet citizens' demands.  The means of governments to do so varies quite widely, with important consequences for governance and quality of life for citizens in the region.  This dissertation seeks to explain these differences in state capacity, shown through the variance in the amount, type and incidence of tax collection, as a result of relationships between citizens and the governments.  Building on network theory, the interactions between state and societal actors are shown to provide information to governments that enhance the state's ability to perform its functions and promote citizen support for government action.  States with strong or abundant links to society are predicted to be able to extract more resources and do so more efficiently than those weakly connected.  In particular, the provinces of Argentina will be compared for their connections to citizens, including to whom and how public services are distributed, the geographical spread of infrastructure, and the extent of government involvement in financial transactions.  This work will add a large cross-sectional and time series database of revenue, infrastructure, financial and public services variables for the national, provincial and some municipal governments of Argentina.  Additionally, the project will incorporate data and research from other countries of Latin America, promoting understanding of other countries in the region.  This research incorporates two methodological tools, network theory and GIS, that are underutilized in political science and has already involved policymakers and scholars from the fields of economics, computing, and political science from the United States, Argentina and Brazil.  The resultant data, publications and analyses will be broadly disseminated to interested scholars and policymakers.<br/>

The structures of ribosomes from all living organisms are fundamentally related, indicating that all ribosomes use the same basic mechanisms in protein synthesis. A major question facing molecular biologists is to understand the molecular basis of translation, and how the ribosome works. There is increasing evidence that the ribosome is a dynamic molecular machine, with moving parts that are largely composed of RNA. It is possible that understanding translation at this level may contribute to knowledge of the origins of life, as well as shedding light on the question as to why RNA stands at the center of so many fundamental cellular processes. This project is based on the structural knowledge provided in recent years by x-ray crystal structures and cryo-EM reconstructions of ribosomes and ribosomal complexes. These structures are essential for an atomic level understanding of the mechanism of action of ribosomes, but are not in themselves sufficient. Structures suggest possible mechanisms, but are unable to prove their existence. Accordingly, molecular genetics approaches will be used to directly test models that have been proposed for several basic ribosomal mechanisms, particularly ones that implicate movement of parts of the ribosome structure. These studies will make use of recently implemented methodologies, including the use of specialized ribosomes and affinity-tagging of rRNA that make possible direct read-out of in vivo protein synthesis activity of mutant ribosomes, and isolation of pure populations of mutant ribosomes for in vitro studies. Dr. Noller has trained a large number of graduate and postdoctoral students, many of whom have gone on to independent positions and have developeed productive and successful research programs of their own. He has consistently made strains, mutants and clones developed in his laboratory available to othr researchers throughout the world. Both these elements of broader impact will continue as a result of this project.

In addition, the project is enhancing student support services and restructuring the first-year experience so that students obtain better foundational training and better training in teaching and communication skills. The scholarships and support mechanisms are designed to increase retention by partially freeing at-risk students from teaching obligations so that can focus more on their studies during the first two critical years.<br/><br/>The project's intellectual merit lies in the enhanced experience for graduate students in the first years of their studies, allowing more time and more support to master the crucial mathematics essential for research in the field and to make the transition to skilled educator and communicator of sophisticated mathematics.<br/><br/>The broader impact of this project is that it is reducing attrition and providing more opportunity for underrepresented and financially disadvantaged students to pursue advanced training in the mathematical sciences, thereby leading to an increase in the supply of highly trained mathematical scientists in the workforce.

Such approaches are unable to generalize and essentially<br/>rely on memorizing the translations of words and phrases that are<br/>observed in training data.<br/><br/>This project aims to improve the quality of SMT through the<br/>introduction of more sophisticated models which represent phrases<br/>using multiple levels of information. This can include basic<br/>linguistic information such as part of speech, lemmas, and agreement<br/>information (case, number, person), as well as more sophisticated<br/>linguistic detail including semantic classes, argument structure,<br/>co-reference, phrase boundaries, and information propagated from<br/>syntactic heads.<br/><br/>By annotating all data with this information and extending models<br/>appropriately, there is the potential to learn much more from<br/>training than was possible under previous approaches. There is now<br/>the potential to learn translations of unseen words if other forms of<br/>the words occur; it is now possible to learn general facts about a language's<br/>word order; it is now feasible to use linguistic context to generate<br/>grammatical output. Such generalization has the potential to result<br/>in much higher quality translation, especially for languages that<br/>only have small amounts of training data. It therefore represents a<br/>significant advance over previous approaches to SMT.<br/><br/>Multi-level models have the potential for wide-ranging impact on<br/>all language technologies. Simultaneous modeling of different<br/>levels of representation is an extremely useful and natural way of<br/>describing language. This project is developing a general framework<br/>for the creation of multi-level probabilistic models of language and<br/>translation, and exploring its application to tasks beyond<br/>translation including generation, paraphrasing, and the automatic<br/>evaluation of natural language technologies.

The investigators propose a general approach called the integral transform approach to facilitating dimension reduction. The key idea of this approach is to use integral transform and response transformation to change the domain where dimension reduction is <br/>performed. Due to the availability of a wide range of transformations and integral transforms, this approach leads to a flexible and effective framework for addressing and resolving challenges raised by high dimensionality. Through a series of well-defined research problems, the investigators study this framework and develop specific dimension reduction methods for many important regression applications. The success of this project not only provides effective practical tools for high-dimensional data analysis but also represents an advance in the theory and methodology of semiparametric inference.<br/><br/>High-dimensional data that involve a large amount of variables are nowadays routinely generated and collected in areas such as scientific research, government, business, etc. It is well-known that high dimensionality causes difficulties in processing and analyzing these data. This is commonly referred to as the curse of dimensionality. There is an urgent demand of statistical tools that are able to mitigate the curse of dimensionality through dimension reduction. This project represents an answer to this demand and is particularly aimed at achieving dimension reduction in regression. The results from this project can be widely applied in areas where regression involving a large number of variables is required. Gene expression and protein sequence data analysis is one such example. Therefore, this project can help enhance scientific research and discovery and benefit a variety of social and economical activities.

Species differences in behavior, however, have made development of clear mechanistic models difficult. This project investigates the complexity of behavioral mechanisms using a combination of field experiments and computational models. Field studies address important emerging questions on neuropeptide modulation of female affiliative behaviors. Synthetic experiments with agent-based models allow exploration of conditions impractical or impossible in empirical tests. The models are expected to propose new mechanisms for neuropeptide control of behavior. This project thus implements a tight experiment-model-experiment loop and develops a new paradigm for a systems biology approach to understanding social behavior. Neuropeptides can alter a variety of vertebrate social behaviors, including parental, aggressive, and reproductive behaviors. Specifically, this project will determine the effects of vasotocin on female phonotaxis in gray treefrogs and subsequently a computational model for phonotaxis that can make predictions as to how neuropeptides influence social behavior will be developed. This model will then be tested under natural conditions for verification. Results from these studies will significantly advance our understanding of the effect of neuropeptides on female behavioral plasticity. This project also includes a significant training component, with involvement of an undergraduate field biology class (populated with 30% under-represented minorities) and training of a post-doctoral fellow and graduate student in a unique inter-disciplinary environment. In addition, a new course on modeling approaches to behavioral sciences will be developed.

Building upon previous work that discovered an anisotropic, photoinduced decrease in thin films consisting of Prussian blue analog materials, hetero-layered films and nanoparticles will be generated and studied. The new materials are expected to possess new magneto-optical functionality above 77 Kelvin. Frustration in two-dimensional triangular lattices possessing two magnetic exchange parameters will be studied by low temperature thermodynamic measurements, and the ratio of the couplings will be tuned by pressure and deuteration. The results will test the rich and diverse phase diagram that has been predicted and will investigate magnetic interactions mediated by hydrogen bonds. The research is interdisciplinary and international, involving physics-chemistry collaborations and coworkers at Safarik University, Kosice, Slovakia. The work is expected to require studies at national laboratories, including the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory in Tallahassee and the Spallation Neutron Source at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Junior researchers, including high school, undergraduate, and graduate students, will participate in the research and will be trained to explore and model new magnetic phenomena possessing potential applications in magneto-optical recording devices and switches.<br/><br/>Non-technical:<br/>This project studies the magnetism of new two-dimensional and nanoscopic systems. Due to the increase of competition between the microscopic magnetic spins embedded in the new structures, the dynamics of the magnetism is expected to evolve in ways not usually observed in larger magnets. These fundamental studies will provide a roadmap for the design and fabrication of new materials possessing magneto-optical functionality in a range of temperatures that makes them technologically useful. A blend of microscopic and macroscopic probes are used to explore the foundations of the magnetism, and national facilities, like the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory in Tallahassee and the Spallation Neutron Source at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, provide specialized resources needed for the investigations. The interdisciplary research involves a long-standing and productive physics-chemistry team and consists of an international collaboration with researchers at Safarik University, Kosice, Slovakia. High school, undergraduate, and graduate students participate and drive the efforts while receiving training on how to model and explore magnetic phenomena down to nanoscopic length scales. The research is expected to provide a roadmap for new technological developments of magneto-optical recording devices and switches.

A high-power, picosecond-pulsed laser will be configured for multi-user access with data acquisition hardware that includes: (1) a time correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) PC card; (2) a stage, interface, and software for fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM); (3) a fluorescence lifetime spectrometer; (4) electronics and software for time-gated optical and electrical detection of single ion channels in large lipid bilayer membranes. The specific research contributions facilitated by this instrumentation request include: (1) the development of a novel time-gated detection scheme that will expand the detection area for single molecules in the far-field by ~100-fold over the existing state-of-the-art technique; (2) a comparison of the dynamics and structure of alpha hemolysin and Anthrax toxins in lipid membranes; (3) a study of electron transfer and solvation dynamics in polyelectrolyte multilayer (PEM) thin films; (4) the development of new time-resolved fluorescence assays for structure/function studies of cGMP-dependent protein kinase.<br/><br/>Fluorescence instrumentation provides an excellent means for fostering interdisciplinary scientific investigation because fluorescence applications are replete throughout chemistry, biology, and physics. Fluorescence measurements record the emission of radiation after being probed with a laser or light source. They are inherently sensitive, enabling trace amounts of material to be probed. Once established, the techniques are relatively simple and robust, which facilitates multi-user accessibility. The equipment will be used by undergraduates in research and laboratory instruction.

BOX 400195	CHARLOTTESVILLE	VA	229044195	4349244270	BIO	7714	9179, 9183, BIOT, 1096, 1228	$0.00	The scope of this project is to understand how physiological changes induced by emotionally arousing events improve the degree to which affective experiences are stored into long term memory. This research is driven by the hypothesis that the vagus nerve and brainstem neurons that they synapse upon serve as an interface between autonomic arousal, produced by hormone secretion in the periphery, and accompanying changes in neurotransmitter release in the brain that then accelerates memory storage processing. The project will obtain electrophysiological recordings from the vagus nerve to assess how fluctuations in visceral signals regulate the release of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine in brain areas where affective and contextual components of newly learned events are encoded. Other experiments will use behavioral, neurochemical and immunocytochemical endpoints to identify how experiences of an emotional nature increase central noradrenergic transmission. They will also identify how potentiated norepineprhine initiates intracellular signaling cascades that convert novel experiences from labile traces into more permanent long term memory. The overall project is expected to reveal neural and molecular systems that permit arousal-induced changes in peripheral autonomic activity to regulate the strength in which new events are encoded into memory. This project will also provide extensive research training for undergraduate students majoring in Psychology, Cognitive Science and Neuroscience as well as provide an avenue for undergraduates to develop independent thesis projects prior to graduation. These types of opportunities have proven beneficial in not only training the next generation of behavioral neuroscientists, but also in ensuring their entry into productive graduate psychology or neuroscience graduate programs.

0742211	SGER: A Virtual Community of Construction Scholars and Practitioners	CMMI	CIVIL INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS	10/01/2007	08/15/2007	Eddy Rojas	WA	University of Washington	Standard Grant	Dennis Wenger	09/30/2008	$40,001.00	Russell Walters, Lucio Soibelman, William O'Brien	erojas1@udayton.edu	4333 Brooklyn Ave NE	Seattle	WA	981950001	2065434043	ENG	1631	029E, 036E, 1057, 9102, 9237, CVIS	$0.00	This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) proposes to enhance the infrastructure for construction research and education though the development of virtual networks and partnerships. This virtual community concept allows construction scholars to share their expertise with other academics and to create a greater synergy to advance construction research and education. The Construction Institute has expressed an interest in including practitioners as part of the community. By including practitioners, the reach of the community will increase significantly. More practitioners will visit the web site and interact with academics. Moreover, academics will also be able to find and contact practitioners who may be working or who have extensive experience in areas related to their research projects. This interaction may lead to collaborative research projects and a greater appreciation for research in our industry.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit <br/>The construction industry, by its nature, is fragmented due to the large numbers of subcontractors, material suppliers, insurance agents, design firms, lending institutions, owner organizations, and construction researchers. Any effort to provide greater synergy among these groups will have a significant impact on advancing knowledge and promoting best practices to the construction industry. Construction researchers have produced a significant body of knowledge that needs to be shared with others in the industry. This project is the first of its kind in terms of the scope and level of collaboration with industry and government to create such an information source for the construction industry. The principal investigator and co-principal investigators are well suited to develop and maintain such a website because of their varied backgrounds in information technologies, membership within the Construction Research Council, and interest in promoting and sharing research knowledge and expertise with other academics and industry practitioners. To ensure the success of this project, the research team will work with the Construction Institute (CI) to provide the most useful product for the industry. It is anticipated that development efforts will include valuable input from the CI Board of Directors and other CI practitioner members. <br/><br/>Broader Impact <br/>Some academics have correctly argued that the construction community in the United States has been evolving over the last decade and that many construction programs are now operating outside of the traditional engineering colleges, where most CRC members belong to. In the last few years many of these programs are also focusing on graduate education and are beginning to incorporate research as an intrinsic part of their mission. Most non-engineering construction programs are part of the Associated Schools of Construction (ASC). By including members of ASC as part of our community, the Virtual Community of Construction Scholars and Practitioners would become the first organization to bring together CRC and ASC members for the benefit of our construction academic community. Interaction between CRC and ASC members would have the potential to further encourage current ASC research efforts. Some academics have also correctly argued that in an era of globalization, an on-line virtual construction community should not be limited to U.S. membership. By including international members, the Virtual Community of Construction Scholars and Practitioners would bring together construction scholars from around the world for the benefit of our construction academic community. Interaction between domestic and foreign scholars would have the potential to further encourage international research efforts and to develop a better understanding of the major challenges faced in international construction efforts. Finally, in a recent NSF-sponsored workshop between the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and construction academics, a suggestion was made to create a database of test-beds in construction engineering and management to facilitate validation of construction research efforts. Several organizations such as NIST, as well as academic institutions, have physical laboratories and digital infrastructure (databases, software, simulations) that could be used to validate construction research. By creating a test-bed database within the Virtual Community of Construction Scholars and Practitioners, scholars will gain knowledge about the existence of these test-beds and potentially enhance the validity of their research findings in ways not possible today.

Glinert	09/30/2011	$392,268.00		swan@cse.msstate.edu	PO Box 6156	MISSISSIPPI STATE	MS	397629662	6623257404	CSE	7367	7367, 9150, 9215, HPCC	$0.00	Augmented reality (AR) is a technology where computer displays add (superimpose) computer-generated, graphical objects to a user's view of the physical (real) world. AR is distinguished from the better-known virtual reality (VR), wherein an observer sees an entirely computer-generated graphical scene. AR makes possible visualization techniques that have no real-world equivalent; one such technique is x-ray vision, where AR users perceive objects which are located behind solid, opaque surfaces. In this project the PI will empirically study how egocentric depth perception (the distance from an observer to an object) operates in AR. The PI will conduct a series of experiments, in which observers judge the depth of AR-presented virtual objects. These experiments will use two different categories of dependent measures: visually directed actions, and application-based tasks.<br/><br/>A commonly used visually directed action is blind walking, where observers view a target, cover their eyes, and then walk to the target location without sight. There are good theoretical arguments that visually directed actions measure a relatively pure percept of egocentric distance, uncontaminated by observers' cognitive knowledge. Furthermore, there is a substantial body of empirical data that describes visually directed action distance judgments of both real-world objects, and virtual objects viewed with VR display devices. These data indicate that, under full-cue conditions, real-world objects are judged without systematic error up to ~20 meters, while the distance of VR objects is systematically underestimated (a phenomenon which has been studied extensively but not yet fully explained).<br/><br/>The application-based tasks are motivated by compelling applications of AR technology. One such task is perceptual matching, where the depth of a virtual and a real object are matched; this task is an important component of AR applications in medicine and image-assisted surgery, AR situation awareness in urban settings and buildings, and others. Another such task is forced choice, where the depth of a virtual object is placed into one of a small number of categories relative to other objects. This task is motivated by applications such as an AR airport control tower and an AR urban situation awareness system, where observers must make decisions based on the gross spatial arrangement of virtual and real objects.<br/><br/>Although the egocentric depth perception of real-world objects and VR-presented virtual objects has been widely studied, currently there exists very little empirical data on the issue, an absence this research will correct. Furthermore, because the present studies will use two complimentary categories of dependent measures, they will allow measuring the degree to which phenomena such as the VR underestimation effect, which has been found by visually directed action tasks, is also present in qualitatively different dependent measures. This will help resolve controversial questions regarding the degree to which such phenomena arise from the choice of dependent measure versus deeper perceptual mechanisms.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: In an applied context, a better understanding of how AR depth perception operates is necessary for many compelling AR applications to be realized, and the empirical data gathered through this activity will hasten AR application development. In addition, through this activity a series of students will receive a blend of experience in both computer graphics and human-subject empirical methods; upon graduation these students will be well-positioned to contribute to the important emerging research area of applied perception in computer graphics.

However, some important estuarine chemical fluxes and processes amongst them the flux of material from shelf bottom waters up into brackish surface waters and the flux of regenerated material off-shelf in bottom waters remain poorly understood. <br/><br/>Scientists from the University of Southern Mississippi, the University of South Alabama, and the University of South Florida would determine the distributions of nutrients, trace elements, radium isotopes and other tracers in the outflow of the Mississippi River to (1) to constrain water, nutrient and trace element fluxes; (2) to compare chemical distributions in different distributary mixing zones of an estuarine system to see how physiographic differences affect chemical fluxes; (3) to examine physical-chemical speciation of trace elements in a river plume/estuary mixing zone to see how sources and sinks of the trace elements are reflected in the speciation; and (4) to further develop and apply radium tracer methodology to these problems. Results of the field work would be incorporated into mass balance models of the Mississippi River outflow system to provide a more quantitative and systematic estimate of material fluxes. <br/><br/>As regards broader impacts, this study would further our understanding of transport and cycling of nutrients and trace elements in river-dominated coastal systems. Understanding the fluxes of these elements in coastal and estuarine systems would allow for the development of management models and scenarios to predict the effect of management policies on the chemical and biological health of the coastal zone. This study would help foster new inter-institutional collaborations with two new investigators. Two graduate students from the University of Southern Mississippi, one graduate student from the University of South Alabama, and one graduate student and two undergraduate students from the University of South Florida would be supported and trained as part of this project.

Despite this wide use, the exact mechanisms for the resolution of analytical solutes are not clearly known. The predictive capabilities of HPLC models are therefore severely limited. Prof. Parcher's research centers on the investigation and elucidation of the strong molecular interactions observed in both the stationary and mobile phases, addressing the observed complexity of the stationary phase and the experimental and theoretical problems involved in delineating or even defining the mobile and stationary phases within an RP-HPLC column.<br/><br/>The research will facilitate the design and development of improved materials, instruments, and experimental techniques for the separation and identification of a wide range of analytical samples. It involves the application of novel experimental techniques to the investigation of a long-standing problem, viz., the exact role of the stationary phase in RP-HPLC. Even small improvements in our understanding of the fundamental parameters controlling a technology used so extensively in a wide variety of laboratories could have a wide-spread impact in science. A potential peripheral benefit would be a reduction of the empiricism and Edisonian approach to methods development presently practiced in many analytical laboratories. Students participating in this work will receive excellent professional preparation in critically important research at the interface between physical and separations chemistry.

This is done by exploiting many kinds of redundancies peculiar to feedback controllers but that are not exploited by any current processing architecture. The work is in collaboration with on-site micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) researchers to develop practical solutions for software control in that environment. The broader impact of this work also includes the development of better architectural design metrics applicable to control system design as well as opening new engineering areas to the benefits of low-power digital control. Since much of this work can be tested in FPGA emulation, we plan to include the participation of undergraduates in the construction of multi-threaded controller software to test these ideas using tools developed for this work.

Angiosperms literally makeup the fabric of our modern society by providing food, medicines, as well as furnishing essential ecological services that define global biogeochemical function. Paradoxically, the flowering plants are also the youngest major group of land-based life, which raises the question: How did angiosperms achieve such high diversity and nearly complete worldwide dominance of plant communities over a relatively brief time in plant evolution? The goal of the research is to understand early ecology flowering plants from a mechanistic ecophysiological perspective. The research integrates recent advances in living ?basal? angiosperm phylogenetics with fine-scale physiological analyses to trace the early evolutionary diversification of physiological mechanisms in angiosperms. Specific physiological approaches include the stomatal regulation and leaf gas exchange, optical transport inside leaves and photosynthetic capacity, and leaf water-use performance. By attaching fine-scale ecophysiological mechanisms to explicit leaf anatomical traits observed in the earliest known angiosperm fossil leaves, the research will uncover the habitat contexts and the selective pressures bearing on early angiosperms and how early angiosperms responded ecologically to Cretaceous global environmental change. <br/><br/>In broader impact, the research will make the resources available in the PI''s laboratory at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville for the education, mentoring, and training for undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral researchers in research, oral presentation, critical thinking as well as knowledge of botany, ecophysiology, and evolution. This work will also create unique training and educational experiences for US students working in partnership with Latin American and Papuan undergraduates participating in supported field research in Peru and Papua New Guinea, respectively.

One of the most noticeable and important differences among participants in such networks is their status rank or relative prestige within the group. The goal of this research project is to understand how group decisions are made in these kinds of settings. The investigators propose to do so by integrating two highly successful, formal-mathematical theories of social influence in sociology: status characteristics theory (SCT) and social influence network theory (SINT). Each theory alone does not address our research question. One the one hand, SCT provides a precise way of quantifying the status rankings of task group members, but it lacks a model of the social process by which (dis)agreements unfold and opinions form. On the other hand, while SINT does offer a mathematical model of the process by which opinions form in groups, it does not in its current form account for the status rankings of task group members. However, the formal-mathematical structure of each theory facilitates their integration in a way that provides a solution to the research problem we raise. <br/><br/>The researchers plan to conduct a laboratory experiment examining the impact of status differentiation on opinion formation in 30 two-person groups, 30 three-person groups, and 30 four-person groups. The goal is to make precise point predictions about group members' final opinions starting with only two knowns: group members' initial opinions and the distribution of status within the group. In terms of the broader impacts of our work, the investigators concentrate on the longstanding general question of how social order is achieved in complexly differentiated groups and social systems. In the modern world, decisions bearing on the orderly maintenance of various aspects of daily life are predominantly achieved through non-coercive mechanisms involving social influence. School board members, for example, must decide how to ration limited tax dollars. Organizations must decide how to translate the requirements of legislation into their daily operations. And teams of hospital administrators must come up with and implement quality standards and best practices to improve patient safety. This work will shed light on the social process by which such important decisions are made.

This approach will introduce rather radical and unconventional approaches. In fact, the work is inspired by the work that is done, almost entirely, outside of the networking community. Specifically, they plan to leverage a number of algorithmic breakthroughs in the fields of learning theory, combinatorial optimization, distributed computing, and online algorithms that provide a different perspective for designing many components of a new Internet architecture.<br/><br/>Since the topologies, traffic patterns, and application requirements on future clean-slate networks are highly uncertain at the moment, this suggests creating a technology-independent architecture of the future Internet, with the emphasis on solving basic intellectual challenges in a rigorous analytical way. The researchers will thus pursue a systematic study of technology-independent, theoretically-validated, and model-independent components of the future Internet architecture.<br/><br/>In this proposal, the researchers will focus on the basic architectural components, such as maintaining the Routing Metric and designing proper flow control mechanisms. These components must be capable of supporting heterogeneous resources allocation, including the wireless periphery. Additional important consideration is security: protecting the routing structure against Denial-of-Service (DoS) and potentially even Byzantine attacks. They issues are closely related to each other. For example flow control must ensure stability of distributed load sensitive re-routing which is essential for security.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: As a result of this work, the future Internet will be much more robust, both in terms of security and in terms of ability to support applications with quality of service guarantees. Many applications, e.g., medical teleconferencing, virtual classrooms, military applications and others will be enabled by new Internet architecture. These new applications will have broad impacts on society as a whole.

In recent years, more research has been directed to high levels of planning and management, cooperative control and information fusion among multiple autonomous vehicles, and vision-aided intelligence. The goal of this project is to develop an unmanned vehicle test-bed wherein various unmanned vehicles will be developed and tested so that research work on autonomous technology can be conducted. Not only will the test-bed proposed in this project serve as a unique platform for various advanced research topics, but also the development process itself provides unique opportunities for our faculty and students to work interactively. Overall, the on-going research activities of the faculty and the students will benefit from the development phase of the system immediately and from the test-bed system after being developed. <br/><br/>Broader Impact: CSUN is a Primarily Undergraduate Institution and has a strong commitment to research that involves and provides training to both undergraduate and graduate students. The campus is a federally designated Minority Serving Institution and Hispanic Serving Institution, and is regularly ranked in the top 20 institutions for the number of Bachelor degrees awarded to minority students. National Science Foundation has ranked the College of Engineering and Computer Science as one of the top five master's institutions in the nation for producing undergraduates who go on to obtain doctoral degrees in science and engineering. Furthermore, nearly 72% of the College's undergraduate enrollment and 64% of its graduate students are ethnic minorities. Therefore, the proposed project will directly impact underrepresented students in the engineering and technologies.

Fichthorn<br/><br/>University/Institution: Pennsylvania State Univ.<br/><br/>Title: Multi-Scale Simulation of Droplets on Solid Surfaces:<br/>Super-hydrophobicity and Super-spreading<br/><br/><br/>This project consists of an investigation of the spreading of liquid drops on solid substrates using molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations and hybrid MD and continuum computations. These studies address three major challenges in understanding spreading and capillary flows: (1) Understanding mechanisms of surfactant-mediated spreading; (2) Elucidating mechanisms of Super-hydrophobicity on rough and patterned surfaces and; (3) Developing a simulation methodology that incorporates the vast temporal and spatial scales involved in spreading, ranging from molecular-level kinetic mechanisms operating at the contact line to macroscopic hydrodynamic mechanisms. The MD simulations will be beneficial in unlocking important molecular details, while the hybrid model will allow insight into the interplay between molecular and hydrodynamic mechanisms that drive spreading.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: Droplet spreading on solid surfaces plays an important role in numerous industrial applications, such as coating, painting, spraying, molding, fiber manufacturing, and Micro-fluidics, as well as in biological applications, such as surfactant replacement therapy. Most theoretical studies in this area have employed continuum models that lack microscopic details at the moving contact line. The MD simulations will furnish molecular-level details important for understanding surfactant-mediated spreading and super-hydrophobicity. These details are important in the choice or design of surfactant molecules and the effective creation of hydrophobic surfaces. The proposed research also addresses a clear challenge in this area: The development of a simulation methodology that incorporates the vast temporal and spatial scales, ranging from large-scale convection to molecular <br/><br/><br/><br/>details at the contact line. Development of a multi-scale simulation method will allow us to fully capture the intricate interplay between microscopic processes and macroscopic events in spreading and other surface involving moving three-phase contact lines.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: In addition to graduate student and postdoctoral training and the involvement of undergraduate students in computational research, aspects of the proposed research will be incorporated into a graduate course on interfacial transport phenomena. Professors Borhan and Fichthorn will team-teach a graduate course on computational methods to introduce students to multi-scale modeling and the hybrid MD-continuum method. Finally, the PIs will advance the state of the art in multi-scale modeling and understanding of interfacial transport by organizing a symposium on wetting and capillary phenomena at the 6th International Conference on Interdisciplinary Transport Phenomena.

A disaster-tolerant communication network must work despite interference among users as arises when first responders converge at a disaster site. Conventional interference avoidance methods offer diminishing capacity per user as the user density increases. Cooperative communication can solve the problem by taking advantage of the interference, thus saving total network transmit power. However, the performance of existing cooperative communication algorithms vary significantly with the channel statistics for which they are designed and, also, waste received mutual information when the channel is better than the transmission rate or suffer an outage when the channel cannot support the transmission rate. This research explores the design of a cooperative communication system, composed of single or multiple antenna nodes, that works across varying channel conditions in the sense that outage is eliminated and received mutual information is not wasted. The goal of the project is to take an information theoretic solution all the way to a single-chip implementation to advance communication and coding, as well as system-on-chip (SoC) implementation. The project tackles research problems that are at the intersection of three areas: (i) communication theory, (ii) very large-scale integration (VLSI) signal processing, and (iii) system-on-chip architecture and design.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: The project advances interdisciplinary communication system research and design. The system-on-chip realization has the potential for application in future fixed or mobile ad-hoc wireless networks with the capability to work under strong interference as required by first responders, potentially strengthening national security and emergency preparedness. The proposed project provides an educational opportunity to expose students to the diverse aspects of communication system theory and practice. It will also involve undergraduate students and students from underrepresented groups through an integrated research and education program.

He will compare his 2002 reconstructions for the period 1915-1999 (where he used Mt. Wilson (MTW) and Sacramento Peak Ca K images), with results now emerging from UCLA's NSF-funded re-digitization of MTW data for the period 1915-1984, as well as with those from manual reduction and digitization of data for the period 1907-1995 from the Kodaikanal (India) Ca K archive. In order to expedite this data comparison, the PI will organize an open international workshop in the US for wide community participation. <br/><br/>The PI will also use the white light facular record, compiled by the Royal Greenwich Observatory (RGO) in the United Kingdom between 1874 and 1976, to extend his irradiance reconstruction backward in time by a further 50%. The ratio of facular and sunspot areas early in a sunspot cycle has been shown to be a good predictor of sunspot cycle amplitude during the RGO observation period. The PI will measure this ratio on white light images obtained after the end of the RGO record in 1976, to test (and potentially extend) the utility of this sunspot activity predictor.<br/><br/>This research is important to climate studies and to the interpretation of global warming observations. This project presents a plan for reconstructing, physically describing, and ultimately predicting solar radiative input variations to the Earth. The PI has published copiously on this subject and has been active in public outreach activities. He founded the East Point Solar Observatory in 1995 in Nahant, Massachusetts, and has organized a local NASA-sponsored children's summer astronomy program.

Spengler	07/31/2011	$396,760.00		clancy@cs.berkeley.edu	Sponsored Projects Office	BERKELEY	CA	947045940	5106428109	CSE	1640, 7640	7218, 7640, 9218, HPCC, 7233	$0.00	Lab-centric instruction is a substantial extension to the widely advocated use of supervised closed labs as a required part of the course. In lab-centric courses, lecture and recitation time is traded wholly or in large part for supervised, structured labs that become the primary resource for student learning. Berkeley has offered lab-centric instruction in CS1 and CS2, and instructors have observed numerous benefits over and above those claimed for lab-augmented instruction. The vision is to significantly expand the use of lab-centric instruction into all CS courses (especially upper division) and academic settings. We propose a three-year project with the following goals. 1. Assemble a diverse team of leaders in communities related to lab-centric instruction: CS curriculum, pedagogy, teacher education, digital repositories, and educational technology. 2. Evaluate the state of lab usage and barriers to adoption of lab-centric formats in courses across the range of higher-educational instructional contexts. 3. Create an online space to support the growth and functioning of the lab-centric community. 4. Recruit instructors to develop and refine a small number of lab-centric segments for inclusion in upper-division CS courses, and to evaluate the effectiveness of the supporting tools and materials for this development and wider community interaction. 5. Provide outreach for the lab-centric community and the online center and dissemination of the project results through a variety of educational forums. The Berkeley lab-centric courses appeared particularly to benefit students traditionally underrepresented in CS courses. Extension of these results to other institutions through the efforts of the proposed community would have a significant impact on CS education. Lab-centric materials should be readily sharable, and therefore contribute greatly to educational infrastructure. We will provide broad outreach and dissemination to instructors, and encourage leaders to pursue new, related avenues of research. The benefits of lab-centric instruction should be extensible to lab instruction in other science and engineering disciplines, encouraging collaboration and cross-fertilization between community members and educators in these outside disciplines.

One particularly unique example involves interactions between a migrating cell and those that are in its path. Avoiding inappropriate interactions is essential for a navigating cell to reach its intended target. In humans, disruption in this process results in polyspermy and neuronal defects. In plants, cell avoidance is exceptionally important during reproduction when pollen tubes avoid egg-bearing ovule structures that have already been fertilized. However, since pollen tube repulsion occurs within opaque floral structures, the dynamic nature of these interactions and the signals that mediate them remain poorly characterized. Recently, a simple biological assay was developed to directly observe pollen tube-ovule interactions. This assay revealed that a short-range repulsion signaling is initiated from an ovule soon after a pollen tube enters it. Capitalizing on this finding, a variety of cell biological, molecular, genetic, biochemical and computational approaches are proposed to conduct a thorough characterization of pollen tube repulsion in the model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana. Insights gained on avoidance of spurious fertilization events could ultimately help in developing genetically modified pollen that cannot fertilize native species, which is an impediment breeders must overcome while developing transgenic crop varieties. This study will generate novel image analysis algorithms that will benefit other migratory cell models such as neurons and dictyostelium, and an open-access educational website on plant reproduction that can be freely used by educators, students, and the public. Biology faculty from Pima Community College, a non-Ph.D. granting institution, and undergraduates, especially those from under represented Native American, African-American and Hispanic communities, will carry out parts of this project. Exposure to biology and hands-on training in research will motivate them to choose a career in science.

There is an urgent need to integrate, index and model multimodal data across a large population in order to discover a more detailed understanding about process interaction in this very complex biological system. Current state-of-the-art computational and software technologies fall short in multimodality data integration and modeling, and integrated analysis of diverse neuroimaging datasets across human subjects. The overall aim of this proposal is to develop a novel, rigorous framework for integrated modeling and analysis of multimodality neuroimaging data based on Riemannian geometry, multivariate simplex splines, and statistical learning. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merits<br/>This interdisciplinary research team will design a fundamental framework for advanced and integrated analysis of brain imaging data. All research activities will address the following major themes and objectives: (1) To explore new theoretic tools based on Riemannian geometry of 3-manifolds for the development of a novel Canonical Volumetric Model (CVM) which provides volumetric mapping of individual brain to a solid unit sphere with accurate matching across subjects; (2) To design hierarchical spherical trivariate simplex splines for compact representation, integration, indexing and visualization of multimodality heterogeneous imaging data with high efficiency and accuracy, which can further refine the intersubject registration through level-of-detail matching in a higher dimensional physical space based on the integration of the hierarchical spline volume with Lagrangian dynamics; (3) To design new statistical learning and mining methods to analyze simultaneously the variety of data across the broad range of spatial and temporal scales and human subjects in order to infer the dynamics of brain functions in neurological disease studies. <br/><br/>Broad Impacts<br/>This research will contribute to the data-intensive brain study by offering an accurate, robust, and innovative scientific approach for analytic integration, statistical modeling, and quantitative analysis of a variety of brain imaging data. The proposed computational framework has the potential to be applied across multiple areas of brain research as well as in clinical diagnosis. It is likely that this work will impact a large number of patients with neurological diseases and will provide a commonly accepted standard infrastructure for use by many other researchers. The PIs'' research endeavors will be tightly integrated with a complementary set of educational objectives, including: (1) the development of new strategies for truly multi-disciplinary science education; (2) the enhancement of the existing curricula; (3) the doctoral training of graduate researchers; (4) the implementation of mentoring activities for students from underrepresented groups.

The project would create a model for how universities can become engaged in local youth communities broadening the impact of work done by their own researchers. The project brings together a unique set of partnerships including a research university (MIT), city-sponsored youth programs (Cambridge, MA); a local public school system; a national radio network; an established youth radio organization; a nationally-broadcast science news/talk radio program (Science Friday); a web-based organization specializing in the distribution of independent radio programming, and experienced evaluators of informal-learning programs (Goodman Research Group). Guidance in understanding complex environmental issues will be provided by faculty, staff and students of the pre-existing MIT Terrascope program. Participants will see their work distributed nationally, both on air and as podcasts delivered via the Science Friday media site.

It makes a lot of sense for the agents collectively to avoid making the same mistakes multiple times, rather than just individually. Clearly, leveraging trust or shared taste enables a community of users to be more productive, as it allows them to repeat each other's good decisions while avoiding unnecessary repetition of mistakes. In this case, the job of exploring different options can be ``distributed'' among cooperative users. The question is whether it is possible to design an algorithmic tool for learning from the experience of others while minimizing repeating their mistakes. This is certainly possible if all the agents that can cooperate and trust one another, namely consider the same actions to be mistakes, know about each other.<br/><br/><br/>However, in general, the above assumptions may be problematic, since reliable agents in the system must be able to divide the job of exploring different options, and the cost of mistakes associated with such exploration, among themselves, without knowing in advance whose advice can be trusted. This appears to be ``mission impossible'' if adversaries are in a majority; yet this is exactly what we will accomplish in this research effort. Notice that with adversarial majority, any attempt to use classic tools in distributed computing such as Byzantine agreement is hopeless. The main idea is that we only strive to optimize the overall performance, rather than perfectly reconstruct the preferences or discover the coalitions of honest users. Informally, this can be stated via the notion of ``regret'': one can analyze their decision in hindsight, determine the best dynamic prescient strategy that they wish they had followed, and estimate the performance gap versus this strategy.

However, to date their impact<br/>has fallen short of this potential. This is not surprising; wireless sensor<br/>networks are difficult to design and program. Experts in application domains<br/>such as biology and civil engineering have neither the training in embedded<br/>system programming and design required to develop adequate wireless sensor<br/>networks, nor the time or inclination to become embedded systems designers.<br/>For wireless sensor networks to live up to their potential, they must be easy<br/>for application experts to design and program instead of requiring embedded<br/>systems design expertise.<br/><br/>This project seeks to put wireless sensor network design and deployment within<br/>the reach of applications experts. This project will identify a small set of<br/>application archetypes, described in terms meaningful to application<br/>developers, that capture the most common application structures. Each<br/>archetype will be backed by a compilable specification written in a simple<br/>high-level archetype-specific language. After customization, a specification<br/>will be passed to a synthesis algorithm to produce a working hardware-software<br/>system. Synthesis of efficient wireless sensor networks would be intractable<br/>without an appropriate hardware-software platform. Therefore, this project<br/>will also determine the particular types of hardware and software components<br/>necessary to enable support for wide range of archetypes. A configurable<br/>hardware-software platform will be developed based on these findings.

Two avenues of study will be pursued. First, single molecule fluorescence energy transfer will be used to measure the distances between chromophores on the DNA strand, providing structural information. Second, the influence of crowding on the energetics of the hairpins will be measured. Through absorption spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), the effects of crowding on the free energy, enthalpy, entropy, and heat capacity changes for denaturation will be measured. Outcomes are expected to enable new understandings of the effect of DNA sequence and the cellular environment on the types of structures that form from repeated sequences. <br/><br/>This project will teach science through research to undergraduates at Furman University. The students will learn to organize and disseminate the outcomes of their research activities through presentations at professional meetings and through publication in the primary literature. The new instruments and experiments will be integrated into laboratory classes, and as well a postdoctoral associate will be mentored for a future faculty career at an undergraduate-focused institution.

Smith-Doerr	07/31/2008	$6,000.00		dr289@columbia.edu	2960 Broadway	NEW YORK	NY	100276902	2128546851	SBE	7915	9179, SMET	$0.00	This dissertation improvement project, funded by the Science and Society Program, explores the history of the molecule bisphenol A as a means for examining the political, economic and scientific changes that shaped society and science in the last five decades in the United States. Used in plastics production and known to mimic the natural hormone estrogen, bisphenol A is an economically vital and scientifically controversial chemical that by the 1990s was ubiquitous in the environment. This research traces the rise of bisphenol A's economic success and scientific controversy from the late 1950s up to the present. It discusses how the plastics industry association, federal agencies, research institutions and environmental advocacy organizations shaped chemical policies, markets and scientific knowledge, and how the often contentious relationship among these individuals and institutions informed understandings of risk, toxicity and safety. The methods employed in this research include document analysis of archival collections, oral history and interviews. The archive collections for this research include the following: the papers of the Society of the Plastics Industry at Hagley Library and Museum, a private collection of the papers of Theo Colborn, and the papers of the Manufacturing Chemists Association. An oral history with Theo Colborn and interviews with researchers studying bisphenol A provide contemporary insight into the development of knowledge about the chemical's toxicity and mechanisms of action over the past fifteen years. In addition, this research includes document review of published scientific papers, trade journals, newspapers, government reports and Congressional hearings. This research proposes to advance knowledge in the history of science and society through its unique focus on a specific chemical as it entered markets, shaped scientific knowledge, informed regulations, and transformed the molecular environment in which we live. This history makes visible the molecular environment and ties its narrative to the broader political, economic and environmental changes during the period after the establishment of chemical regulations, the rise of a globalized economy and a shift towards free market economics and deregulation. As such, this work contributes to a broader intellectual inquiry into the implications and affects of the post-war chemical revolution on society and science. Central to the scientific debates about bisphenol A's toxicity is the battle to claim authority over scientific knowledge. In order to untangle the competing claims of truth and scientific legitimacy, this historical study explains to a scientific and lay audience alike, how knowledge developed over time within a specific political and economic context. With possible legislation for a ban of bisphenol A in California, and several relevant archival collections closing to the public, this research is incredibly timely. Research findings will be disseminated in multiple forms including the dissertation, a series of brownbag discussions with advocacy groups concerned about bisphenol A, and participation in an interdisciplinary roundtable discussion about the impacts of ubiquitous chemicals like bisphenol A on the political, social, environmental and economic development of the United States.

Kaup<br/>University of Wisconsin-Madison<br/><br/>Natural resource extraction in an era of neoliberal globalization presents a paradox. As firms seek to establish global sourcing regimes, the fact that raw materials are found in naturally pre-determined forms and places constrains the choices such firms have in determining the locations of their extraction activities. Therefore, these firms are, of necessity, forced to face the natural, social, and political difficulties of place that their global strategies attempt to avoid. <br/>Examining the case of natural gas extraction in Bolivia, this research will refine sociological theories about neoliberal globalization, natural resource extraction, and social movements by engaging three primary research questions: 1) How have neoliberal economic reforms influenced the opportunities and constraints of the actors within Bolivia's natural gas sector and how have these reforms affected Bolivia's recent hydrocarbon nationalization? 2) How do place-specific social relations affect natural gas extraction and, in turn, how does natural gas extraction affect place-specific social relations? 3) How do the material characteristics of natural gas affect changing political and economic environments? Twelve months of ethnographic fieldwork will be conducted. Data will be collected through interviews, primary documentary sources, and participant observation. Interviews will be conducted with approximately seventy individuals, including government officials involved in the hydrocarbon sector, representatives of extraction firms, and members of social movements engaged in the struggles over Bolivia's gas, and community members in sites of extraction<br/><br/>The particular natural resource and geographic location under study, natural gas in Bolivia, is of great political, economic, and social importance today. In addition to contributing to sociological theories of resource extraction and neoliberalism, an analysis of the complex dynamics unfolding within Bolivia's natural gas sector will inform public policy in Bolivia and will help traditionally underrepresented communities and indigenous groups identify points of leverage through which to negotiate with transnational corporations for mutually beneficial investments.

Akkara	07/31/2010	$379,000.00		sjiang@u.washington.edu	4333 Brooklyn Ave NE	Seattle	WA	981950001	2065434043	MPS	7623	7237, 7573, 9161, 9178, 9251, AMPP, SMET	$0.00	This award to University of Washington by the Biomaterials program in the Division of Materials Research is to develop a dual-functional zwitterionic biomaterial based on carboxybetaine (CB) as an alternative to poly(ethylene glycol) for targeted drug delivery. CB is a dual-functional material, which is not only highly resistant to nonspecific protein adsorption, but also has abundant functional groups convenient for ligand immobilization. The availability of abundant functional groups in a non-fouling background is essential to the success of targeted drug delivery in complex environments. Abundant functional groups will allow one to prepare conjugates containing cocktail drugs for better drug efficiency, to introduce multiple functional groups for multiple-step drug delivery, and to immobilize small ligands for improved drug delivery kinetics. Furthermore, carboxybetaine is a smart material responsive to changes in ionic strengths and pH values, which are desirable for drug controlled release. Due to a zwitterionic nature similar to proteins, CB-coated nanoparticles (NPs) are sterically very stable under physiological conditions. Carboxybetaine is similar to glycine-betaine in structure and is thus biomimetic. The objective of this work is to demonstrate the uniqueness (i.e., dual-functional and zwitterionic characteristics) of CB-coated nanoparticles as targeted drug delivery carriers. NPs of 50-150nm will be coated with CB. The chain lengths and densities of the CB-based polymer and the number of carbon atoms between the two charged groups of the CB monomer will be varied. CB-coated NPs will be evaluated for their physicochemical properties, their steric stability under physiological conditions, and their resistance to nonspecific protein adsorption from blood plasma. CB-coated NPs will be functionalized with targeting groups for cancer cells via carbodimide chemistry and evaluated for their cell association and uptake. Ligand densities will be varied to study their effects on targeted delivery. The circulation time of these modified NPs will be evaluated. Results will be compared with those from poly(ethylene glycol)-modified NPs with or without the targeting groups. <br/><br/>The ability of drug carriers to target specific cell types is critical for effective drug delivery. While PEG has been widely used to improve the efficacy of drug delivery carriers, there are a very limited number of functional groups available to immobilize target-specific ligands. The dual-functional zwitterionic biomaterial proposed in this work is well suited for this purpose. The success of this work will open a new direction to build better drug delivery systems. Although CB-based materials used for drug delivery carriers will be demonstrated in this work, they have a very broad range of applications in tissue engineering, coatings for medical devices, and biomedical diagnostics. Graduate and undergraduate students will be involved in this project, particularly those from underrepresented groups. Undergraduate researchers will be recruited through well-established outreach programs at local research centers, in which the PI has been actively involved. In addition, the knowledge will be disseminated through various courses taught or under development by the PI. The proposed work will also involve international collaborations.

The Sanov group will specifically investigate (1) the time-resolved dynamics and interference effects in bond-dissociation reactions of molecular and cluster anions, (2) the structure and photodetachment dynamics of molecular and cluster anions and (3) the solvent-enabled and solvent-controlled reactivity in molecular cluster anions. These studies will be carried out in the gas phase in the collision-free conditions of the group's negative-ion beam source, coupled with pulsed laser excitation and photoelectron imaging. <br/><br/>Photoelectron imaging provides a powerful new tool with which to study chemical reactions in exquisite detail. In addition, the photoelectron images can be used a quantum photographs which provide deep insights into the fundamental details of chemical bonding. The images themselves are used to illustrate quantum aspects of chemical bonding in undergraduate and graduate teaching. Besides the broader scientific and educational impacts of the imaging techniques being pioneered in Sanov's laboratory, Sanov will continue to train a new generation of scientists working at the intersection of chemistry and physics.

This colonization will be understood using DNA data to build evolutionary-trees and assign dates to branching events (past speciation). Results will be viewed against the backdrop of past climate change. Cicadas are excellent models for this type of study because they occur worldwide, their courtship songs make them easy to collect and identify, and their sedentary life histories generally result in clear boundaries between species. This research will aid in the establishment of a better taxonomy of cicada species and help catalog and understand the earth?s rapidly disappearing biodiversity.<br/><br/>Because this project involves researchers in the US, China, Australia, New Zealand, Slovenia, France, the Netherlands, and South Africa, it will promote the international exchange of ideas and technology as well as specimens. This research will address a broad range of important questions, such as how climate change affects speciation and the application of information on mechanisms of molecular change over time to molecular tree-building. Species new to science will certainly be discovered. This research will contribute to the training of undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral researchers including under-represented groups. The results of this research will be made available through our website and will include an electronic field guide with distributions of collected cicada species and photographs and songs of many species. The website will also provide an updated list of world cicada workers, status of world cicada taxonomy research, links to other cicada sites, three large web-searchable databases (Magicicada, NZ cicadas and World Cicadas), lists of locations of types, maps, phylogenetic trees, locality guides, and more.

To understand the evolutionary processes that led to key human features such as upright walking, a large brain, tool manufacture and use, and behavioral flexibility, it is necessary to develop a context for these innovations. What were the environmental forces that shaped and directed human evolution? Human evolution is a consequence of the interactions of early hominids with their physical and biological surroundings and there is a need to specifically reconstruct these parameters in association with discoveries of hominids. Documenting paleoenvironments at a relevant scale in the terrestrial record and developing causal links between evolution and environmental change, however, remains difficult. As a result, aspects of human evolution have been interpreted in the context of environmental data from the marine record, which provide a detailed record of large scale climatic change. This approach is valid only if links between global or regional phenomena and specific shifts in local hominid ecosystems can be demonstrated.<br/>This proposal seeks to address directly these issues by examining a series of environmental indicators to develop a high-resolution paleoenvironmental framework for a hominid-bearing sequence in the East African Rift Valley.  This can then be linked to global climate changes. The work has at its focus a 2-3 million year old sedimentary sequence exposed in the Tugen Hills, a fault block within the rift valley near Lake Baringo in Kenya. This sequence exhibits abrupt and repeated cycling of major freshwater lake systems reflecting fluctuating climatic conditions. In recent research, this project has established a clear link between these short term oscillations (every 23 thousand yrs) and Milankovitch cycles that result from variations in the solar radiation received at the top of the atmosphere, controlled by variations in the geometry of the earth''s orbit. These changes represent the major driving force in the earth climate system through time, including glacial-interglacial cycles. Thirty-six vertebrate fossil localities, including three hominid sites, can be linked directly to this sequence, providing an opportunity to establish patterns of response by animals and vegetation to these short term shifts. <br/>This research represents the first attempt to develop multiple environmental and ecological indicators that can be linked directly to Milankovitch cycling in a terrestrial rift valley context. These data will be used to generate insights into the evolutionary response of hominid ecosystems to these pervasive climatic oscillations over the last six million years in Africa. While these data relate directly to fossil hominids and their vertebrate communities in the Baringo Basin, linking local ecological shifts with orbitally-forced patterns of insolation affords the prospect of extrapolating the affects of climatic oscillations on terrestrial ecosystems regionally in the past. With these data, we can begin to formulate high-resolution models for interpreting correlations between climate and human evolution, and elucidate the role of environmental change as a potential driving force in mammalian evolution in general and human evolution in particular. This research will foster highly interdisciplinary and collaborative studies, essential in developing perspectives of the multi-dimensional links between evolution and ecology. The project outlined here represents an ideal forum in which to generate and integrate research ideas cutting across traditionally disparate academic disciplines. The study will broaden opportunities and enable the participation of graduate students as well as research personnel from the National Museums of Kenya. <br/>

First, the Principal Investigator will implement a set of unified prognostic parameterizations that simulate moist convective and cloud microphysics processes, from cloud resolving to low resolution regional modeling scales. Second, a series of numerical experiments will be run with decreasing horizontal resolutions with the aim to define the spatial scale at which parameterized convection and fractional cloudiness are both needed. The numerical experiments will be run over the Continental United States for which observations and small-scale forecasts are abundant and readily available. <br/><br/>The research aims at quantifying the impact of horizontal resolution on the simulations of cloud systems in WRF, using parameterizations of moist processes which interact between each other in a consistent manner. Using a high resolution numerical experiment as a reference, the research addresses the questions 1) What is the horizontal resolution at which parameterized convection becomes needed, and how to best simulate interactions between convection and cloud microphysics processes?; and 2) What is the horizontal resolution at which parameterized fractional cloudiness becomes needed, and how to best simulate the cloud amount as a function of cloud microphysics sources and sinks?  <br/><br/>Broader Impacts:  The research addresses the need of the WRF Users' community by providing a set of parameterizations of moist processes that were consistently developed, and can be used at different horizontal scales.   <br/>
0717934	Doctoral Dissertation Research: The Microdynamics of Participation in Civil War	SES	POLITICAL SCIENCE	09/01/2007	08/05/2007	Michael Gilligan	NY	New York University	Standard Grant	Brian D. Humes	08/31/2008	$12,000.00		michael.gilligan@nyu.edu	70 WASHINGTON SQUARE S	NEW YORK	NY	100121019	2129982121	SBE	1371	9179, SMET	$0.00	This research focuses on the motivations for popular participation in civil war. Considerable research has already explored what sorts of countries tend to engage in civil war, but little has been done to investigate why individual citizens, formerly peaceful, decide to take up arms. This work seeks to determine 1) what needs, desires, and events are most likely to drive people to the battlefront and 2) what sorts of individual characteristics are associated with civil war participation.<br/> These questions are best addressed through surveys of civilians and former fighters. Survey research is becoming the technique of choice in studying civil war, given the gaps in our current understanding of conflict dynamics. Prior to the introduction of survey research into the field, political science relied heavily on cross-national studies and qualitative accounts. Cross-national quantitative studies had suggested an abundance of primary commodity exportables and significant ethnic heterogeneity are strongly associated with war outbreaks, but these findings have failed to withstand scrutiny. Qualitative studies have offered intuition and several hypotheses, but most have yet to be rigorously tested on a large scale. Surveys allow for the statistical test of hypotheses about motivations for participation using data from a broad sample of average citizens who found themselves in an extraordinary situation. <br/> A survey will be conducted of nearly 2000 former fighters and civilians in Burundi. This data, combined with narratives from former fighters, will help explain participation Burundi''s revolution. In addition, a sister survey will be conducted in Liberia, where the dynamics, objectives and outcome of the war were very different. Liberia serves as a contrasting case in many important ways: participation in Liberia was often coerced while in Burundi it was largely voluntary; Liberia''s natural resources are abundant while Burundi''s are scarce; and Liberia has sixteen ethnic groups living within its borders, while Burundi, with twice the population, has only three. By varying the social environments in which people make their participation decisions, which motivations are most important will be tested across different cultures and conflicts. <br/> This research agenda can make an important contribution to policymaking as well as academia. While civil wars are initiated by individuals with the resources, power and motivation to begin an insurgency, they are perpetuated through the support and participation of normal citizens. Understanding under what conditions individuals fight can help interested parties predict not just which countries might break into conflict, but which citizens will participate in it. This knowledge can make efforts at prevention targeted towards specific classes of people and social conditions, thus making conflict prevention more effective.

This piece of equipment will become the state-of-the-art centerpiece of a Provostial SCAN (Social, Cognitive, and Affective Neuroscience) Center at SBU. The scientific focus of the SCAN Center is on the neural bases of social, cognitive, and affective human behavior. Until recently, psychological models were based solely on behavioral data in the absence of neural data to constrain these models. Now, with the advent of non-invasive neuroimaging methods, it has become feasible to explore the neural correlates of complex human behavior, leading to an explosion of articles and two SCAN-related journal launches in 2006 alone. The scanner will support research and education in the context of projects centered on three themes: (1) interpersonal social relations, (2) cognitive processes, (3) emotional processes. In addition, the proposed scanner will support (4) relevant technology development. <br/><br/>The SCAN Center will integrate research and education by promoting teaching, training, and learning through MRI-related courses, seminars, hands-on training and experimentation, and mentored instruction in experimental design and analysis. The Center will promote diversity by broadening the participation of underrepresented groups in research and teaching. For example, some participating departments (Psychology, Biomedical Engineering) have graduate populations of 50% female and 10% minorities. SBU's undergraduate population is even more diverse: 50% female; 10% African American, 22% Asian American or Pacific Islander, 9% Hispanic American. Highly successful undergraduate programs include WISE (Women in Science and Engineering), a program initially funded by NSF that provides support to female students interested in scientific careers, and MARC (Minority Access to Research Careers), an NIH-funded fellowship program for minorities to work in laboratories. The proposed equipment would substantially enhance the infrastructure for research and education for SBU and BNL faculty and students. SBU and BNL are fortunate to already have a strong cadre of researchers with interests in the SCAN area, with a total of more than 200 peer-reviewed neuroimaging publications among them, but these researchers currently have no local access to a research-dedicated, modern human neuroimaging facility. The Center will bring these researchers together to produce exciting collaborations and enable SBU to attract other outstanding SCAN scientists in the future. There will also be broader impact on SBU's technology-development opportunities: SBU has well-recognized strengths in biomedical engineering, physics, computer science and other disciplines that will contribute to the impact of the center. The Center in turn will stimulate exciting interactions among these disciplines and with the SCAN researchers. With time, SBU's Research and Development Park adjacent to the main campus will provide even more exciting opportunities for scientific collaboration and for technology development. Thus, the establishment of the SCAN Center for will provide significant immediate benefits for a diverse group of investigators and for the University's research enterprise. Finally, there will be broader impact on Long Island's community: through publications, public lectures, and SBU's press office, results from the SCAN Center will be widely distributed to the public. The SCAN Center will also feature displays of the brain and ongoing research projects, and be open for tours by local K-12 schools and other groups interested in learning about neuroscience.

Although it is commonly assumed that a free press promotes democratic ideals of openness, accountability, and public-mindedness, recent lessons of democratization reveal a more tangled skein. On one hand, private media outlets can privilege certain voices, protect the interests of the propertied classes, and monopolize the means of cultural production; on the other hand, government regulations can create their own exclusions, privileges, and monopolies. Such is the paradox of the press in Venezuela, where the field of journalism is polarized along political lines.<br/><br/>The researcher will investigate the current disjuncture between the ideal of journalism as a force for democracy and the actual institutions of the press in Venezuela through intensive participant observation at three Caracas-based newspapers, chosen to represent different sectors of print journalism. He will work alongside journalists on a day-to-day basis to observe journalism politics and practices as well as to develop rapport needed for successful interviews. To provide context for the ethnographic case studies, he also will conduct semi-structured interviews with the representatives of the full range of Venezuelan journalism, including broadcast journalists, foreign correspondents, and journalism professors, as well as journalists representing a wide variety of Venezuelan newspapers. Finally, he will do content analyses of newspaper articles and legal documents. <br/><br/>Social scientists increasingly have become interested in what makes democracy succeed or fail. However, most research has been conducted at the national level and is therefore unable to answer questions about the daily practices that bring about those successes and failures. This research is important because it will be one of the first social science studies that will employ the tools of ethnography to investigate closely the actual practices that comprise the relationship between journalism and democracy. The research also will contribute to the education of a social scientist.

The Wireless Knowledge Infrastructure (WiKI) project develops an extensible general-purpose system layer based on new ideas for applying concepts from programming languages and database systems - the use of declarative languages and composable views of router, network and host state - to allow monitoring, event detection and triggering based on extant network conditions and policies. Declarative routing algorithms take into account application, session and network state information to set up adaptive routes among mobile devices and wired infrastructure nodes. Cross-layer and cross-domain integrated views of data streams expose and abstract data from different subsystems and layers, providing a step towards a Knowledge Plane for networks. WiKI takes an exploratory approach, namely building a small-scale software infrastructure using 802.11 to understand the wireless challenges of heavily populated urban areas in Philadelphia, and to develop prototype services based on a WiKI model. WiKI services are incrementally refined as the research progresses. <br/><br/>Broader Impact: The end goal is incorporation of WiKI platforms, software and services into the Wireless Philadelphia municipal WiFI effort, notable for its integral Digital Inclusion program which attempts to reach economically disadvantaged households in our city.

Instead, the existing solutions are utilized and updated with new data. By detecting more data in training without compromising data privacy, the algorithms are designed to increase the detection capability. The work addresses the following challenging aspects of machine learning based methods for network anomaly detection:<br/>. Development of Adaptive Machine Learning Algorithms,<br/>. Hierarchical Dimension Reduction and Clustering, and<br/>. Privacy Preserving Distributed Data Mining for Effective Utilization of Private Intrusion Detection Data Sets.<br/>The former, responding to the change of data over time, designs/creates efficient algorithms to delete the influence of old data and incorporate the new data, without recomputing the solution. The second, addressing the fact that typically data sets are intrinsically unbalanced when the problem is considered as a binary problem, generalizes further the cluster preserving dimension reduction methods to reflect the hierarchical cluster structure in dimension reduction. The latter, responding to data privacy, designs machine learning based anomaly detection algorithms by integrating locally generated results into one integrated solution without revealing the critical information in each local data set, thereby preserving privacy.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The research produces methods that are likely to have great impact on a broad range of applications in very high-dimensional spaces. Their adaptability allows significant reduction in the computational complexity substantially improving the possibility of detailed study of data which has been prohibitively expensive. Involving an HBCU institution in the area, this female faculty PI leads an effort to engage more women and minority students.

They plan to study the Effective Reduction of Industrial GHG Emissions via Energy Integration and Biomass Utilization. Green house gases (GHGs) pose some of the most profound impact on the environment and climate change. The largest anthropogenic sources of GHG emissions are power plants and industrial processes. Two of the most viable alternatives for reducing GHGs from industrial facilities are the cogeneration and the utilization of biomass in conjunction with combined heat and power (CHP) in the process industries. The project is aimed at addressing the problem of GHG emissions from industrial facilities in Egypt and the United States. In particular, the following important strategies will be employed . Process Cogeneration: resulting in significant reduction in energy and emissions of GHGs . Biomass Utilization for Energy: leading to carbon sequestration during crop growth . Techno-Economic-Environmental Analysis and Policy Recommendations. The project will develop systematic and generally-applicable procedures to enable the foregoing three strategies and to answer various questions including the following: . How to incorporate biomass utilization in co-firing and energy production within an existing process? . How to reconcile thermal demands with cogeneration opportunities through integration? . What are the economic and policy factors to insure technical feasibility? . What is the impact on GHG emissions and what are the necessary GHG offsets/subsidies? Several industries in the US and Egypt will actively participate in the project and will serve on an Industrial Advisory Committee for the project. In addition to refereed publications and conference presentations, the research findings will be documented through software which will be developed and disseminated to industry to enable applications. Finally, a workshop will be organized at the end of the project to formalize the recommendations for policymaking to reduce GHG emissions. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: This program is based on a novel framework that involves a holistic approach to optimizing process performance while minimizing environmental wastes. A combination of simulation, process synthesis, integration, and optimization models will be developed, integrated, and solved. The models will provide a new platform that can systematically provide a complete strategy for reduction in energy consumption and emission of atmospheric pollutants. These new techniques will lay the foundations for fundamental research in the emerging area of environmental biocomplexity and will result in institutionalizing an unprecedented environmental and systems research program. <br/>Broader Impact: The project will result in the creation of an active, broad-based program to address these complex environmental and processing issues in unique, fundamental, and integrated ways. The potential environmental benefits include reduction of environmental discharges, conservation of natural resources, and abatement of pollution. The work can also impact growth policies by providing cost-effective process design and operation policies. The solutions will describe the role of the various entities in solving the problem and provide a cost-benefit analysis for the proposed strategies. The developed approach is generic enough to be adapted and evolved to study pollution prevention for a wide variety of industries. This project is being supported under the US-Egypt Joint Fund Program, which provides grants to scientists and engineers in both countries to carry out these cooperative activities.

Because excluded volume entropic effects in highly confined domains become significant, they can contribute strongly to the thermodynamics governing the formation of organized nanostructures in amphiphilic systems. The project proposes hypothesize that entropic contributions from these excluded volume effects as well as long-range interactions with bounding surfaces can produce a range of equilibrium morphologies in confined situations that are not present in bulk systems. The proposed experiments follow recent results in our laboratory, where we have observed that for a CTAB/HDBS model catanionic system, three-dimensional confinement produced by polystyrene latex spheres dramatically reduces the size of vesicles formed in the void spaces between the packed beads. These results show near quantitative agreement with a simple thermodynamic model that accounts for both enthalpic and free volume entropic contributions to the change in Gibbs free energy. In the proposed research, a range of model amphiphilic systems and confinement surfaces are deliberately chosen to vary from essentially non-absorbing to strongly absorbing for the surfactant molecules. Small Angle Neutron Scattering (SANS), Cryogenic Transmission Electron Microscopy (cryo-TEM), and dynamic light scattering to evaluate and understand nanostructure morphology will be used. They will exploit the high specific surface area available in confined systems as well as the small length scale between boundaries for active control of nanostructures. These experiments will provide important new understanding of microstructure evolution in amphiphilic systems under<br/>conditions of three- and two-dimensional confinement.<br/><br/>Broader Impact This research will help provide a fundamental basis for the development of several technologies where soft colloidal materials are passed through highly constrained domains, including the fate of drug delivery vehicles in blood vessels and in the skin, recovery of oil from shale using surfactant flooding, detergency and micellar enhanced ultrafiltration. The work provides an opportunity for graduate students to gain experience in SANS and cryo-TEM, a combination that is unusual. Undergraduates will get experience with cryo-TEM. Contents from this research will be incorporated directly into a 'Advances in Interfacial and Colloidal Phenomena' course taught regularly by the PI for students and industry participants. In order to expose more students to electron microscopy, the new TEM arriving on our campus will be internet-enabled. The internet electron microscope will be offered to local high school students and science teachers through an outreach program being developed at URI. In addition, the PI will host a minority high school student in his laboratory over the summer, to work on an independent sub-project. The faculty mentorship provided through this program, already funded through private donations, has been successful in encouraging high school students to think about careers in science and technology. They will work closely with our NSF-funded Northeast Alliance for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (NEAGEP) program to recruit an underrepresented student for this project. URI is a member of NEAGEP and has a program in place on campus to proactively address the shortage of underrepresented minority students receiving Ph.D.s in the sciences, mathematics and engineering (SME). URI has a staffed administrative SME Recruitment and Retention Unit within the Graduate.

Porter of Vanderbilt University. This research will involve investigation of how fats and oils, particularly the polyunsaturated fatty acids, the so-called omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids, undergo a reaction with molecular oxygen known as lipid peroxidation. The research is intended to provide an understanding of this important chemical reaction at the fundamental level. Among the questions that the research addresses are the following: What are the products of reaction? What biological activities do these products exhibit? (some of the products are known to be pro-inflammatory, others anti-inflammatory) What is the reactivity of different lipids towards this reaction? How can antioxidants stop these harmful reactions? <br/><br/>In terms of the broader impacts, this research is quite important since there is evidence implicating increased dietary intake of the omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty esters present in fish oil in the prevention and treatment of a number of diseases in which environmental and lifestyle factors play a role. These include atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes and cancer, among others. Understanding the chemistry involved could lead to ways to prevent these diseases. In addition, the research will involve students in a broadly interdisciplinary program, with studies on fundamental mechanistic chemistry problems relevant to biological problems. The research will involve women and minority students and there is a student volunteer science outreach programs at Vanderbilt that some of the students will be involved with. There will also be collaborative studies with investigators at the Vanderbilt University Medical School.

Our hypotheses are that: (1) as a result of aggregation, nZVI particles can be transported only to limited distances in subsurface; and (2) enhancement strategies such as use of dispersants and pressurized system have potential to enhance transport of nZVI particles in subsurface. The research will include conducting (1) bench-scale column (1-D) experiments to determine transport of nZVI particles in different gradation soils without and with enhancement strategies, and (2) bench-scale tank (3-D) experiments to determine transport of nZVI particles in homogeneous and heterogeneous soils under the optimal conditions determined from the column experiments. Different soil types and commercial nZVI particles will be characterized and used for the experiments. Enhanced treatments will be achieved through the use of novel dispersants, pressurized system, and the simultaneous use of dispersant-pressurized systems. The commercial nZVI particles possess magnetic properties; therefore, a real-time transport of the nZVI particles in porous media will be monitored using an electromagnetic susceptibility sensor system. Tank (3-D) experiments will be conducted to evaluate the effects of soil heterogeneities on the transport of nZVI particles. The reactivity of nZVI particles will be quantified before and after transport in soil contaminated with chlorinated organic compounds. The changes in morphology of the nZVI particles will also be determined using SEM and TEM images. Preliminary mathematical modeling will be performed to predict the transport of nZVI particles in porous media under laboratory and simulated field conditions. <br/><br/>The research will support a doctoral graduate student,, train an undergraduate student, and provide an opportunity to gain emerging and innovative research experience as well as receive mentoring towards their professional careers. Equipment for the research, especially the physical column and tank simulation models, will serve as demonstration tool for classroom instruction on both the undergraduate and graduate levels. The research results will be used to develop new a teaching module Iron Nanoparticles and the Environment and it will be incorporated into different geoenvironmental courses. Research results will be disseminated through a website as well as through publication of journal papers and conference/seminar presentations. A workshop and several open houses and brownbag meetings will be organized for timely feedback of industry and regulatory agencies on the research approach and results. Through such communication, practicing engineers and regulatory agencies can utilize the research results to understand the potential use of nanoscale iron particles for efficient remediation of polluted sites (including brownfields), thereby protecting public health and the environment.

There is a need for new systems software tools to assist in effective fire management regarding where and when to deploy limited firefighting resources. This project develops an integrated data acquisition, modeling, simulation, and optimization software environment for effective wildfire management. This environment integrates real-time acquisition of weather and fire-front position data, fast simulation of fire spread to predict fire behavior, just in-time optimization to compute firefighting resource deployment, and modeling and simulation of firefighting to assess strategies of fire suppression. Integrating these components that are usually treated in isolation enables a novel comprehensive software system to effectively support real-time optimal decision-making for fire management and minimize firefighting risk and cost. Specific research objectives include developing system architecture and a software environment that integrates real time data acquisition, fire spread simulation, stochastic optimization, and firefighting simulation for dynamical data driven wildfire management, and developing runtime environment to support efficient computation and seamless communication among the different functional components in a distributed computing environment. The integrated systems software environment will provide a needed decision support tool to assist in firefighting decision making. The software environment will also serve as a valuable training and planning tool for fire management, and will provide a multidisciplinary educational tool for students and researchers at large.

There is a catalog of related content, along with selected data and multimedia information, submitted from a variety of sources. These will be incorporated in the Virginia Tech 4-16-07 Library Archive, permanently supported by University Libraries.<br/><br/>The target audience includes those interested in how technology aids detection, prevention, and responding to disasters in highly connected settings (e.g., in Virginia's largest university community, at the heart of the Blacksburg Electronic Village). A key question is how digital libraries can work in rapid-response settings, as well as for studying the aftermath of tragedies. <br/><br/>The thrust of this project is development of rapidly prototyped tailored systems for diverse user communities using the 5S theory (i.e., with formally defined underlying concepts: Streams, Structures, Spaces, Scenarios, and Societies), which provides a foundation for integration of distributed content and services. This project will lead to development of the theory and software support for large scale digital libraries that also allow researchers to apply closely-coupled data mining and visualization services, e.g., so that archived content can be efficiently and conveniently analyzed, and so that trends and outliers can be spotted. Computer and information scientists, following legal, policy, and human-subject guidelines, can study portions, or the whole complex, of the resulting testbed - of content, services, usage logs, etc.<br/><br/>Wide use of the digital library by scholars and the public, as well as dissemination of results, through the WWW, publications, and presentations, will ensure the broadest impact.

Multifunctional agriculture is attracting considerable interest because it meets a range of social and ecological challenges to sustainability. This project will test a new model in which multifunctional agriculture is understood as a coupled human-environment system driven by ecosocial feedback, weak-tie social networks and multiple biophysical benefits. In this model, critical ecosocial feedback is mediated by 'weak ties' social networks, or those that bridge between groups. Weak tie networks allow the shared perception of biophysical signals as well as communication, resource exchange, and collective action by individuals and groups. Through weak-ties social networks, multifunctional agroecosystems that generate ecological benefits receive resources that increase their spatial extent, better signal these benefits, and increase the size and resource base of social networks. The project will test the hypothesis that this ecosocial feedback is strong enough to overcome systemic barriers to extensive adoption of an important emerging form of multifunctional agriculture, rotational grazing (RG). Work will occur in three states (NY, WI, MN) that differ markedly in development of RG. The project will examine individual and group behavior and social-network development , assess its biophysical effects, and use these findings to create an agent-based model of RG dynamics. Methods include digital mapping and remote sensing of social and ecological phenomena; biophysical research on terrestrial and aquatic systems at farm and landscape scales; social science interviews and structural equation modeling for farmer and network actors; and integrated modeling. Education and outreach for a variety of audiences include use of the model as a post-secondary educational game on ecosocial feedback, and working with grazing organizations to share the empirical results in a wide range of settings including conferences and strategic planning sessions. <br/><br/>Better understanding of dynamics of multifunctionality is important to society in several ways. In terms of theoretical advances, this research proposes a new model of feedback among social and ecological systems that could be applied not just to agriculture but also to many different kinds of productive systems that involve humans and the environment. In terms of practical outcomes, this project will help lower barriers to the expansion of grazing, which offers considerable potential for rural economic revitalization in many US regions, while also helping make the increasingly important US 'bioeconomy' more sustainable. The proposed research will help identify both opportunities and barriers affecting development of a sustainable bioeconomy based on multifunctional agriculture. Finally, the project helps a variety of different people learn about multifunctional agriculture in particular and human-environment interactions more broadly.

Digital video is a critical and growing multimedia information source, one that is seen as an important to means for universal access to audio and video resources. The web is experiencing exponential video traffic as YouTube, Yahoo, Time Warner, Viacom, and others are presenting an opportunity for migrating advanced research digital video library capabilities into practice. This trend will likely to continue as network bandwidth increases and becomes more widely available. This project will evaluate fielded systems through human computer interaction (HCI) techniques. A primary impact of the project will be in the development and deployment of digital video library toolkits, curriculum support materials, and automated processing and access techniques. These resources will support building other digital video libraries and contribute to the education of those that create and manage these. Automated assistance for curators of audiovisual collections helps to increase the number and types of collections available, while reducing associated costs.

The operation of these membranes is presently limited to below 100C due to the required presence of water (50% relative humidity or above) to obtain high proton conduction. This precludes the efficient use of current PEMs in fuel cells for transportation where operating temperatures of 120C and above are required. Therefore, to overcome these limitations, this project will focus on the development of new advanced ceramic PEM materials that can operate at intermediate temperatures (above 120C) and low partial pressure of water vapor. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: Based on recent crystallographic insights and the current understanding of proton conduction in ceramics, this project will synthesize compounds in the family of pyrophosphates AP2O7 (A = Sn,Zr,Ti); it will investigate their proton conductivity and assess their potential as membrane materials for the next generation of PEM fuel cells. The objectives of the proposed research can be summarized as follows: (a) synthesize advanced pyrophosphate ceramics for proton conduction membranes; (b) characterize the conductivity of the synthesized materials and determine the proton conduction mechanisms operating in these ceramics; and (c) evaluate their potential as proton electrolyte membranes for PEM Fuel Cells. Specifically, acceptor-doped ceramics will be synthesized; their crystal structure, composition, and microstructure will be characterized; proton conducting membranes will be fabricated and their electrical conductivity will be measured. Finally, the effective proton conductivity of the most promising membrane materials will be measured as a function of temperature and atmosphere (partial pressure of H2, moisture, etc.) to assess the performance of the developed proton electrolyte compounds. The uniqueness of the proposed research lies in the rational design and development of an advanced intermediate-temperature PEM material based on merging the field of crystallographic design (crystal structure tailoring) and the recent understanding of the proton conduction mechanisms in oxide ceramics. As such, the research proposed has the potential for a breakthrough development in novel PEM materials rather than an incremental enhancement in the properties. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: As part of this project the PIs will organize and participate in local, national, and international activities with both technical and non-technical audiences to disseminate fact and knowledge-based information about alternative energy sources and technologies, with special emphasis given to fuel cells. Specifically, this will be achieved by: a) Organizing an Alternative Energy station within Engineering Extravaganza, a local showcase of projects and demonstrations open to the general public as part of the yearly Engineers Week activities; (b) Including a module on fuel cells in a departmental program at with nation-wide participation, and (c) Incorporating Fuel Cells as a topic in the Electroceramics Workshops that the PI is currently organizing across the Bolivarian countries in South America.

Through ethnographic research in two water poor communities in and around Mumbai, he will investigate the question of why public water projects proliferate in India even as state agencies profess a commitment to pro-market policy. When operationalized in postcolonial states that do not have histories of substantive citizen rights, the effects of pro-market policies are as yet unknown. Primary research suggests that the ways in which the poor access water in Mumbai complicates the distinction of the public and private, long central to political economy. This research project seeks to understand the shifting boundaries of citizenship and markets in the contemporary state through participant observation among the urban poor, and institutional ethnography of state agencies. By following how the poor access water, this research shall show how formal citizenship articulates with other kinds of political claims by the urban poor. <br/><br/>The research is important because it will investigate why in some social and political contexts water is difficult to commoditize when other basic needs (like food) are distributed through market mechanisms. As such, the social life of water in Mumbai might reveal new insights about the arrangements necessary for the functioning of states and markets. The research also will contribute to the education of a social scientist.

The goal of the fellowship is to increase the participation of minority scientists at the postdoctoral level and to prepare them for positions of scientific leadership in US science. To attain this goal, the fellowship provides opportunities for postdoctoral training and research of the highest quality to recent doctoral recipients.   It is expected that Fellows supported through these fellowships will play important roles in training of the future workforce.<br/><br/>The research and training plan is entitled Geographic variation in sequestered chemical defenses.  Rhabdophis tigrinus (an Asian snake)possesses bufadienolide toxins that serve an antipredatory function and that are acquired solely from toads (Bufo japonicus) that are consumed as prey.  Recent studies have revealed that there is geographic variation in the bufadienolides of R. tigrinus, which may have important functional implications for chemical defense in this species.  Both R. tigrinus and B. japonicus are broadly sympatric on the main islands of Japan, and geographic variation in the bufadienolides of R. tigrinus likely reflects variation in the toxins of B. japonicus.  This research examines the geographic structure and trophic interactions that underlie patterns of chemical defense in species that sequester their defensive compounds.  Objectives are (1) to study geographic variation in bufadienolide-based chemical defenses of R. tigrinus and B. japonicus throughout Japan and (2) to determine whether variation in bufadienolides observed in R. tigrinus reflects the pattern of chemical variation in it prey, B. japonicus.  By testing the hypothesis that the geographic structure of bufadienolide composition in R. tigrinus is a consequence of similar variation within B. japonicus, it will clarify the evolutionary and ecological interactions that have shaped this newly discovered and complex system of vertebrate chemical defense.  The sponsoring scientist is Dr. Alan H. Savitzky (Old Dominion University) and will involve collaboration with Dr. Akira Mori (Kyoto University, Japan) and Drs. Jerrold Meinwald and Frank Schroeder (Cornell University).  <br/><br/>The training goals include broadening the Fellow's experience in chemical ecology by studying a different class of defensive compounds and using new analytical techniques.<br/>

Evasius	07/31/2008	$59,712.00	Darren Long, Daryl Cooper	morwen@math.utk.edu	1 CIRCLE PARK	KNOXVILLE	TN	379960003	8659743466	MPS	1260	0000, OTHR	$0.00	Modern low-dimensional topology is largely concerned with studying the various kinds of geometry that spaces can possess. Two rather different geometries are familiar to us all, specifically Euclidean plane geometry, where the sum of the angles of a triangle is 180 degrees, and the geometry on a sphere (e.g. the Earth), where the sum of angles of a triangle formed from arcs of great circles is greater than 180 degrees. A third, perhaps less familiar geometry, is hyperbolic or non-Euclidean geometry, discovered in the early nineteenth century; here the angle sum of a triangle is in fact less than 180 degrees. Hyperbolic geometry has since assumed a position of pre-eminence in mathematics, owing to its richness and beauty. It should be noted that the mathematics underlying hyperbolic geometry is also important in physics, in particular with regard to special and general relativity. The investigators will acquire a powerful multiprocessor computer with an unusually large amount of memory, and will implement methods they have devised for analyzing deformations of geometries. Knowing the behavior of a geometry under deformations, and the extent to which it can be deformed before it collapses, is an important factor in understanding its nature. The investigators are particularly interested in projective geometry, and a fascinating variant of hyperbolic geometry known as complex hyperbolic geometry (the relation between the standard and complex versions is somewhat analogous to the relation between the real numbers and the complex numbers.) The investigators will need to handle complicated objects, including fractal curves, in 3, 4 or 5 dimensions, necessitating much computer power.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to pursue, with the help of a powerful multiprocessor computer, two avenues of research in low-dimensional topology, each concerned with representations of manifold and orbifold fundamental groups. These two topics share an urgent need for an exceptional amount of computer memory, namely a minimum of 64 GB. The first topic concerns deformations of real hyperbolic structures on 2- and 3-dimensional manifolds and orbifolds to structures arising from real projective or complex hyperbolic geometry. The investigators had previously discovered that certain sporadically occurring closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds with small volume admitted such deformations; however, the underlying cause remains a mystery, and the study of degenerations of the resulting structures is virtually uncharted territory. On the other hand, the existence of complex hyperbolic deformations for the 2-sphere with three cone points (of suitable orders) is well established, but again almost nothing is known about degenerations of these structures. The investigators will use the new computer to implement a battery of methods for establishing discreteness of the associated holonomy representations, including a promising new technique based on the natural fibration from (2n+1)-dimensional real projective space to n-dimensional complex projective space. The second topic of research concerns various conjectures related to representations of 3-manifold groups, including knot groups, onto finite groups.<br/>The need to store large group conjugacy and multiplication tables again mandates the availability of unusual amounts of computer memory.

The instrument will have a sensitivity more than a few orders of magnitude higher compared with state-of-the-art surface plasmon resonance instruments. The instrument will also provide information on the status of bound protein (surface orientation, conformation). The high sensitivity relies on extremely sharp resonance photonic modes, called whispering gallery modes (WGM), in a transparent microsphere less than 0.5 mm across. Light travels the interior side of the sphere surface via total internal reflection to come back in phase after one cycle around the sphere. The light path<br/>becomes slightly longer when biomolecules such as protein bind to the sphere surface, which can be detected as a small red shift of the resonance by an optical fiber touching the sphere. The project will utilize recent discovery and demonstration of enhancing the already high sensitivity of WGM sensor by coating the sphere surface with a sub-wavelength layer of a high refractive index, thus forming a ring ribbon resonator around the sphere for an increased resonance shift.

However, current technologies do not provide satisfactory performance in terms of capacity, connectivity, and delay. Recently, several cooperation schemes have been proposed to improve the network performance. They significantly depart from the traditional point-to-point link abstraction and conventional network architectures and will have a profound impact on the network performance and design.<br/><br/>The goal of this research is to develop the foundations and practical algorithms for applying emerging cooperation schemes in wireless ad hoc networks. These schemes include (i) cooperative communications where multiple nodes intentionally transmit concurrently at the physical layer, for example, cooperative diversity, distributed multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), and distributed beamforming, (ii) network coding where nodes combine data received from neighbors and then transmit these combinations to their neighbors to reduce the number of transmissions and improve throughput, (iii) cooperative infrastructure where infrastructure (e.g., wired base stations) is overlaid over wireless ad hoc networks. This research will develop fundamental performance bounds for cooperative networks, as well as new algorithms and mechanisms for providing network-level services.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of this project include the dissemination of research results through journal and conference publications, and a strong education component that promotes teaching, training, and learning through the active involvement of research students. Education materials will be developed and disseminated for a new course to be taught jointly at the two universities.

Itsweire	02/28/2011	$294,386.00		rudolf@soest.hawaii.edu	2440 Campus Road, Box 368	HONOLULU	HI	968222234	8089567800	GEO	1610	0000, OTHR	$0.00	Inertial instability occurs in rotating flows and results in the growth of perturbations in the form of streamwise vortices. If the intial flow is avortex, these perturbations take the form of toroidal or rib vortices. As they amplify, they begin to interact, forming dipoles that move out of the initially unstable region. In axisymmetric flows, the net effect of the motion and interaction of these vortices is homogenization of potential vorticity, forcing it to vanish in the instability region and beyond which then stabilizes the flow. Recently, scientists from Scripps Institute of Oceanography and the University of Hawaii have found that they can predict, with remarkable precision, the final state after this nonlinear process. They now plan to develop this theory for predicting the evolution of other kinds of vortices as well. Their work will involve numerical and theoretical research of three-dimensional flows and ill consider how this process competes with other instabilities. The results have implcations for the stabilization and maintenance of oceanic currents and eddies. In addition, the results will have an impact on the the development of models which can not resolve small scale processes.

Much of the information that is available about these phenomena originates from observations with limited coverage in space or time. These data therefore cannot provide a complete picture of the phenomena nor address the underlying physics. This research project will attempt to model the SEDs and SAPS with a self-consistently coupled model of the inner magnetosphere and thermosphere-ionosphere-plasmasphere system in order to better understand the storm-time redistribution of plasmas in the ionosphere and plasmasphere. The coupled model used here includes all the storm-time drivers and simulates the subsequent response of the thermosphere, ionosphere, and plasmasphere. A particular noteworthy feature of the model is that it explicitly includes the interaction processes between the ring current and the ionosphere that produces the SAPS. The model includes a realistic magnetic field that will enable the longitudinal dependence of the ionospheric dynamics and electrodynamics to be addressed, in particular with regards to the question of whether the American longitude sector is unique. Three particular research topics to be pursued are: investigation of the plasma source of the SEDs, the altitude coupling of the SEDs and SAPS, and the interaction between reduced conductivities and the SAPS electric field. Extensive model validation against observations will be done, particularly for the gradients in total electron content, as well as comprehensive analysis of the electric fields and the global plasma transport responsible for producing SEDs. Five particular geomagnetic storms will be the focus of the investigation. These occurred from 2000 to 2005 and have been the subject of several publications. The broader impacts of the investigation include new insights into the response of the thermosphere and ionosphere to magnetic storms, a goal of the Space Weather Program, as well as improved understanding of magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling. The project may help lead to a predictive capability for gradients in total electron content which has important Space Weather applications such as for GPS and Wide Area Augmentation Systems (WAAS) used for navigation of commercial aircraft. The project is being led by a female scientist near the beginning of her research career.

In opposition to this, the past half-century has seen a resurgence of continuous and dynamical approaches to the mind, arguing for a smooth transition from cognitive into motor subsystems. This predicts that the dynamic characteristics of observable action will directly reflect underlying thought processes. In support of this, much recent research has shown that continuous tracking of motor movement can provide rich information about the mental processing giving rise to it. <br/><br/>With support of the National Science Foundation, Drs. Rick Dale and Michael Spivey will explore how action dynamics can shed light on human learning. By tracking computer-mouse trajectories, Dale and Spivey aim to uncover how action dynamics evolve as people learn. Several multi-choice, computer-based experiments will employ tasks of varying complexity, from simple associative learning (e.g., pairing symbols) to acquiring knowledge from text. Such measures would supplement traditional performance variables based on discrete answers. These studies can also provide a further understanding of the intimate connection between thought and action. In addition, the work can provide insights about how best to adapt computer systems for education: Through automatic analysis of computer-mouse movements, these adapted systems could detect such states as lack of learner confidence or deep understanding, and could appropriately respond to these potential deficits in real time, and thereby enhance learning. <br/> <br/> <br/>

Dust grains are reservoirs for condensable elements during their transport from the circumstellar winds of evolved stars, novae, and supernovae into ISM clouds that give rise to new stellar and planetary systems. Of all solar nebula bodies, comets contain the least processed materials, both ices and dust. The chemical composition and evolution of comet material can be studied during perihelion passage when solar irradiation enhances the production rate of volatile gases leading to the release of dust from the nucleus and the exposure of refractory material to ultraviolet (UV) flux. This research program is a comprehensive, systematic investigation of two distinct dynamical populations, Jupiter-family (JF) and Oort Cloud (OC) comets. This study of comet dust properties and physical characteristics will: (1) facilitate assessment of the importance of crystalline silicates as a diagnostic of solar nebula evolution and turbulent mixing models; and (2) explore whether comet dust mineralogy is correlated with observed organic volatile production rates. <br/><br/>Understanding how planetary formation occurs in protoplanetary disks is a scientific challenge for the astrophysical community. This initiative contributes to broad cross-disciplinary areas of inquiry. First, the determination and inter-comparison of grain properties in OC and JF comets enable study of the processes that determine the characteristics of bodies in the Solar System and the operation and interaction of these processes. Secondly, comets provide insight into the initial processes of planetesimal aggregation and planet building in the early solar nebula. Specifically, the thermal history of dust grains extant in the early solar nebula can be probed by constraining the properties of dust from comets. Lastly, this program will test the new hypothesis, arising out of comparison of the investigators' observations of the Deep Impact target 9P and the split comet 73P with recent studies of comet gas-phase organics, that comet taxonomy based on current orbital (dynamical) classification should be supplanted by a taxonomy based on physical characteristics of dust mineralogy and grain properties and organic composition and super-volatile production rates.<br/><br/>This program creates an environment for educational mentoring activities in experimental techniques and observational astrophysics at large public institutions with diverse student populations and talent bases. Research opportunities provide an infrastructure to promote student development as scientists and critical thinkers while exposing individuals to how scientific discourse, intellectual exchange, and public outreach are conducted in a dynamic environment of contemporary astrophysics. The investigators' students will utilize a variety of facilities to collect observational data, and participate directly with scientific analyses and dissemination. These activities contribute to workforce development and imparts to aspiring astronomers (and/or students with scientific/technical career objectives) observational and technical expertise, computer programming skills, and analysis methodology. Astronomy, in part because of its stunning imagery, provides a natural gateway for engaging the public in scientific discussions, and helps to foster a broad appreciation for the impact of science and technology. The researchers will disseminate research highlights to the public through a number of education and public outreach activities and venues.<br/>***

The primary objective of the proposed interdisciplinary research and development effort is to assist persons with physical disabilities to perform ADLs using a smart 9-degree-of-freedom modular wheelchair-mounted robotic arm system. The user interface will employ a haptic device with force reflection. Advanced control algorithms for combining the mobility of the wheelchair with the manipulation of the robotic arm will be developed; and sensor-based velocity scaling and assist functions will be used to enhance manipulation range and accuracy for the severely disabled. This will be done by addressing a set of fundamental human-robot coordination and control issues: (1) design of system architecture for sensor assisted scaled teleoperation and (2) combined mobility and manipulation in a task-optimized control scheme. This work will provide a broader impact to both the engineering community and the health sciences community by innovative research in rehabilitation robotics and its integration with education at the undergraduate and graduate levels. Besides assisting people with disabilities to do activities of daily living, the proposed project would strengthen their job prospects by providing better solutions to improve work place performance.

Such data sets include large scientific simulations such as nuclear and power simulations, data relevant to national priority and homeland security, and digital models of defense and commercial equipments such as tanks, aircraft, ships, and power plants. Such large data sets cannot fit into the main memory of the machines. Hence, the performance of the visualization systems depends on how efficiently they can process this data segments and still provide a holistic visualization for efficient and correct decision making. This project involves fundamental research in the analysis of methods that process these large geometry data sets for computer graphics and visualization applications. Using this analysis we model the data access pattern of common geometry processing algorithms. Such models can be used to organize data coherently in the secondary storage so that the access time of the data can be reduced. This will improve the performance of the graphics and visualization systems. <br/><br/>The coarse data analysis systems derive aggregate information from the data and hence are useful in streaming applications and out-of-core implementations; fine data analysis systems are interested in individual data points and their performance is dictated by data access patterns. In this research, we investigate if there is any natural grouping or partitioning of primitives that describes the data access patterns of most common geometry processing algorithms. We explore the existence of a function that would optimize the grouping of primitives and thus benefit a large class of geometry processing algorithms. This study will enable us to suggest an optimal layout for geometric data that would work best for common geometric algorithms.

This workshop, co-chaired by Glenn Tesler (UCSD) and Dannie Durand (Carnegie Mellon University), promises to be an excellent professional development opportunity for graduate students and junior researchers. It will allow them to present their research, enhance their scientific communication skills, and make both domestic and international contacts that will be of great value to the development of their careers. Comparison of related genomes offers enormous inferential power, revealing a wealth of knowledge both about genome evolution itself and about genetic function and cellular processes. Recognition of this fact has spurred efforts to sequence a range of closely related primate and mammalian genomes, as well as concerted efforts to sequence multiple genomes in the yeast, Drosophila and nematode lineages. As the data increase, so do the opportunities and the challenges for scientists to interpret them. The RECOMB Satellite Workshop on Comparative Genomics is a forum on computational aspects of this field. <br/>This award supports the attendance of graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and early career researchers who are United States citizens or permanent residents. It is anticipated that there will be approximately 100 participants, about half of whom will be students. Research faculty within the conference scope will be encouraged to bring their students and have them submit abstracts. Students and underrepresented groups will also be targeted through institutions with summer 2007 bioinformatics programs, including programs at Cal State, Los Angeles and the University of Minnesota. <br/>

Software engineering for cyber-physical systems;<br/>. Sensor Network development tools and programming abstractions;<br/>. Low-level communication challenges;<br/>. Embedded and real-time computing; and<br/>. Data mining of the physical world (to identify anomalous or interesting patterns in streams of real-time data).<br/>Cyber-physical systems enhance our interaction with the external environment in a similar fashion to the way the Internet changed how we communicate. Hence cyber-physical computing represents an era in computing where logical processing is more tightly intertwined with the external physical world. These systems offer a myriad of new challenges that stem from combining processing, communication, and physical interaction with the external world. Promoting practical cyber-physical computing research entails adequate experimental testbeds that allow evaluation, validation, and fine tuning of different ideas. The fine-granularity instrumentation required serves as a unifying theme across various studies. Sensor network technology is expected to economically address this need once key sensor network research impediments are resolved. This research facility is likely to be unique in the nation in its scale.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: This work creates opportunities for interdisciplinary research where problems are solved utilizing CS/CE technology in the context of real applications drawn from environmental and atmospheric science, biology, anthropology, geology, agriculture, etc. The facility enables, among others, studies of infectious disease propagation, climate change, deforestation, and global warming. Additionally, the infrastructure offers active learning educational opportunities.

They possess highly efficient and complicated mechanisms for filtering the water around them, and capturing and sorting particles therein. Their feeding processes strongly couple water-column and bottom communities, and thus they can influence the general well-being of other organisms as well as the overall environment. Because these organisms play such a key role in ecosystems, it is important to understand how they process particulate matter, sorting food from non-food particles, and what factors control the process. <br/><br/>In this research, scientists from two universities will use their previously developed techniques of feeding physiology and biochemistry to address, for the first time, the bases of selection at the cell and organ level to address long-standing questions regarding the mechanism(s) by which bivalves and other suspension feeders accomplish particle selection. At the core of this research are two fundamental questions: 1)Is particle selection an active process, i.e., based on chemically mediated behavior, or a passive process, i.e., based on interactions between particles and mucus-coated feeding structures?; and 2) Do different groups of suspension-feeding molluscs, employ the same or different mechanisms for particle discrimination? Results from this research will provide a better understanding of feeding processes in different species of bivalves, the potential impact of bivalves on coastal environments, and how environmental perturbations (e.g., pollution) might affect particle feeding. Results will be relevant to ecosystem health and shellfish restoration. <br/><br/>The study links government and university scientists, and enhances cross-fertilization of ideas and techniques. Broader impacts of the work will include training of graduate and undergraduate students who will be involved in various aspects of the research and will participate in scientific conferences. Results will be disseminated through scientific literature, conferences, and articles for non-specialists. Working with K-12 educators, the researchers will develop age-appropriate educational packets that will demonstrate fundamental biological principles of an ecologically and economically important group of marine animals in understandable, real-world terms.
0705396	Research in Geometric Group theory: Artin groups and Automorphism Groups	DMS	TOPOLOGY	08/01/2007	08/21/2009	Ruth Charney	MA	Brandeis University	Standard Grant	Joanna Kania-Bartoszynska	07/31/2012	$163,784.00		charney@brandeis.edu	415 SOUTH ST MAILSTOP 116	WALTHAM	MA	024532728	7817362121	MPS	1267	0000, OTHR	$0.00	This project has two main parts. The first concerns automorphism groups of right-angled Artin groups. Right-angled Artin groups are finitely presented groups whose only relators are commutators. They may be viewed as interpolating between free groups and free abelian groups. Thus, their (outer) automorphism groups interpolate between Out(F_n) and GL(n,Z) and provide a context for understanding the similarities and differences between these groups. The goal is to generalize techniques used in the study of automorphism groups of free groups---such as the construction of a contractible outer space with a proper Out(F_n) action - and use these techniques to study properties of automorphism groups of arbitrary right-angled Artin groups. The second part of the project concerns more general Artin groups associated to infinite Coxeter groups. The project will address a number of questions regarding the coarse geometry of these groups.<br/><br/><br/>Geometric group theory may be viewed as the study of symmetry groups of geometric objects. A particularly rich class of geometric objects are cubical complexes with nice local structure. These complexes serve as models for a variety of problems in robotics and have applications to other areas of mathematics. Right-angled Artin groups arise as groups of symmetries of certain cubical complexes. Moreover, the groups themselves have interesting symmetries known as automorphisms. This project will investigate properties of these groups, their automorphisms and the associated geometries. In addition to right-angled Artin groups, the project will study the large scale geometry of more general Artin groups. Some Artin groups, such as braid groups, are well understood and have important applications to topology, cryptography, and other fields. Other Artin groups are much more mysterious and some of the most fundamental problems in group theory, such as the word and conjugacy problems, remain unanswered for these groups. By studying their large scale geometry, the project aims to gain insight into some of these more mysterious groups.
0725079	An Integrated Approach to Understanding Temperature Sensation and Its Behavioral Consequences	IOS	ACTIVATION	09/01/2007	03/23/2009	Miriam Goodman	CA	Stanford University	Continuing grant	Diane M. Witt	08/31/2012	$405,000.00		mbgoodman@stanford.edu	3160 Porter Drive	Palo Alto	CA	943041212	6507232300	BIO	7713	1096, 9183, BIOT	$0.00	Body temperature has profound influences on all aspects of animal biology. All animals, including humans, have the ability to regulate their body temperature by moving to favorable areas in the environment. This behavioral thermoregulation is thought to involve thermosensory neurons in the skin, an internal set point and complex feedback. A major challenge in understanding behavioral thermoregulation is to identify animals amenable to mechanistic analysis. With only 302 nerve cells (neurons), the roundworm C. elegans is an almost perfect organism for such studies. It is the only animal in which the shape of every neuron and its connections to other neurons is known (the wiring diagram). A sub-circuit of 11 bilaterallysymmetric neurons mediate initial responses to temperature. All of these neurons can be identified in living animals, including a pair of neurons that sense cooling and warming (the AFD cells) and are critical for thermotaxis. <br/><br/>In C. elegans, but not in mammals, it is possible to directly measure how these neurons respond to temperature. The proposed research leverages these advantages of C. elegans and takes an integrated approach, analyzing temperature sensation at the molecular and cellular level. Experiments are proposed to deconstruct the molecular networks that make temperature sensation possible and to discover genes responsible for the development or function of neurons that link sensation to behavior. Because the wiring diagram is known, future experiments can investigate the neural circuit linking temperature sensation by AFD to motor output. In C. elegans, the AFD neurons are critical for successful thermotaxis. Other nematodes, which are parasites of agriculturally important plants and animals, are thought to use thermotaxis as part of a host-finding strategy. Some of these parasitic nematodes are known to have neurons similar to AFD, suggesting that the proposed research could have broader implications. In particular, what is learned about the molecular networks responsible for temperature could provide entry points for new research into methods for controlling nematode species that threaten agriculture. <br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this work lies in the establishment of a new animal model for mechanistic analysis of temperature sensation and its behavioral consequences. It has the potential to offer insight into universal molecular, cellular and network-level mechanisms by which sensory information provides essential, real-time feedback for movement. The work derives broad impact from its multidisciplinary approach, combining the experimental and conceptual tools of genetics, cell physiology, and behavioral studies. Since its inception, high school students and undergraduates have contributed to the work, including women and minority participants in the Stanford Summer Research Program. Research opportunities for undergraduates will continue to be an integral part of the proposed work. Additionally, the PI encourages lab members to participate in community outreach activities and provides release time for this important work.
0727498	Collaborative Research: Impacts of Ocean Physics on the Arabian Sea Oxygen Minimum Zone	OCE	PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY	10/01/2007	08/08/2007	Raleigh Hood	MD	University of Maryland Center for Environmental Sciences	Standard Grant	Eric C. Itsweire	09/30/2011	$75,777.00		rhood@umces.edu	BOX 775	Cambridge	MD	216130775	4102212014	GEO	1610	0000, OTHR	$0.00	Oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) in the world's oceans typically occur below regions of high productivity where oxygen is utilized in the remineralization of sinking detritus by bacteria. The Arabian Sea OMZ is one of the most intense such zones in the world ocean with near-total depletion of oxygen in the eastern-central Arabian Sea at a depth from 100-1000 m. Remarkably, the zone is shifted well to the east of the most productive regions of which are located in the western basin. <br/><br/>In this project, scientists from the University of Hawaii and the University of Maryland will collaborate with international partners from India and Japan in order to understand the processes that determine the strength and location of the Arabian Sea OMZ. Their working hypothesis is that physical, and not biological, processes shift this zone to the eastern basin through eddy processes. A hierarchy of physical models will be utilized for this study, each will be coupled to a biological model (NPZD) with an oxygen package. <br/><br/>The research aims to understand basic biophysical processes of the Arabian Sea oxygen minimum zone and the results should be applicable to other such regions in the world's oceans. Because of its intensity, understanding the dynamics of the Arabian Sea OMZ is of global importance. Because of its reducing conditions, the zone impacts the global nitrogen inventory and hence the degree of nitrogen limitation and carbon export. In addition, through the production of N2O, the zone also influences greenhouse gas accumulation in the atmosphere. Finally, the zone is known to have varied considerably on geological time scales which suggests that it may be affected by modern climate change.<br/><br/>The research also contributes to international programs including the development of the CLIVAR/GOOS Indian Ocean observing system and Integrated Marine Biology and Ecosystem Research (IMBER).

By contrast, the present-day Internet architecture concerns itself primarily with issues of ``how'' and ``where''-- what are the protocols by which a data item is delivered and to which topological endpoints. This inherent dissonance of purpose makes Internet security a bolt-on affair---with abstract access control policies pushed off to be implemented by particular applications or mapped onto the poor approximations provided by network-level abstractions (e.g., network firewalls). Moreover, these imperfect mechanisms are themselves attacked with impunity since today's Internet architecture provides a functional anonymity that insulates attackers from any meaningful liability.<br/><br/>This project is developing two key architectural capabilities--host attribution (which physical machine sent a packet) and data provenance (what is the ``origin'' of the data contained within a packet)--to enable the direct expression of a wide-range of security policies. Moreover, these properties are being implemented in a fashion that mandates their use (in a strong sense) by the network, but manages to preserve end-user privacy. The PIs are focusing on two key applications in this work: forensic trace-back and attribution for the purpose of attack deterrence, and defensive data-exfiltration to place precise controls over what kinds of data may move across a network.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: This research is developing key architectural components to improve the level of security and assurance available to network services. In addition, the PIs are initiating a dialogue among both researchers and network operators about critical policy aspects of network security. In particular, information about the sources of both normal and attack traffic that must be safeguarded according to some policy.
0720210	Collaborative Research: Comparative Geochemistry of the Late Cambrian (SPICE) and Toarcian (Jurassic) Positive Carbon Isotope Excursions: New Perspectives on Paleozoic OAEs	EAR	GEOBIOLOGY & LOW TEMP GEOCHEM	09/01/2007	08/10/2007	Ariel Anbar	AZ	Arizona State University	Standard Grant	Enriqueta Barrera	08/31/2010	$74,517.00		anbar@asu.edu	ORSPA	TEMPE	AZ	852816011	4809655479	GEO	7295	0000, OTHR	$0.00	The Paleozoic record is punctuated by multiple, large positive carbon isotope excursions that are expressed regionally if not globally. In younger records, similar excursions are often linked through direct observation to ocean-scale events of enhanced organic carbon burial--typically under well-characterized anoxic conditions. In older sequences, lacking preserved deep seafloor, the nature of oceanic redox on the broad scale can only be surmised through use of geochemical proxies that are typically ground-truthed in younger settings. In particular, our work and that of other researchers has illuminated the great potential of the molybdenum isotope proxy for quantifying global deep-ocean redox, when applied with careful consideration to local oxygen conditions and the basinal Mo inventory. <br/><br/>In this study we expand the concept of an Oceanic Anoxic Event--first defined for episodes of pervasive deep-ocean and epicontinental black shale deposition during the Mesozoic--to address the nature of ocean-scale redox in the Paleozoic. We focus on the Late Cambrian SPICE event (Steptoean Positive Carbon Isotope Excursion), suggested by our preliminary C and S isotope data from shelf carbonates and our geochemical box model to be a prime candidate for an early Paleozoic OAE. The Alum black shale in Sweden shows clear signs of the SPICE excursion in the organic C fraction and evidence for at least local euxinia before, during, and after the event--making it an ideal candidate for Mo isotope analysis. A central goal, then, is to extrapolate the OAE concept to the Paleozoic, which has numerous positive C isotope excursions of varying global expression but little physical evidence for conditions in the deep ocean. We will specifically test whether the SPICE is an OAE. Strongly analogous patterns of C and S isotope behavior, black shale geochemistry, and biotic extinction have been described from the better-known Toarcian event. We therefore seek to compare the shale geochemistry and supporting carbonate proxies for seawater composition for these two intervals to ask: 1) Do Mo isotope records from the Upper Cambrian Alum Shale in Sweden point to the globally expanded anoxia inferred from our high-resolution delta13C and delta34S carbonate data from the United States? 2) Do the SPICE and Toarcian C isotope excursions show analogous Mo isotope and C-S-Fe-trace metal behavior, such that significant new light is shed on the nature of the Cambrian event? 3) Do organic biomarker patterns associated with the SPICE match those observed from the Toarcian OAE, suggesting that euxinia shallowed as its areal extent increased? 4)By analogy, can we extrapolate models for the Toarcian to understand invertebrate extinction patterns in the early Paleozoic, including problematic trilobite extinctions? 5)Using our integrated data for the SPICE as a template, are Paleozoic intervals of pronounced positive delta13C and epicontinental black shale deposition analogous to the OAEs of the Mesozoic? <br/>All of these questions will be addressed through collaboration with experts on each time interval and through use of the geochemical proxies that are staples in our combined research groups--specifically Fe speciation, trace metal chemistry (emphasizing Mo), and novel isotope approaches for S, Fe, and Mo.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts. In a sincere effort to extend the impact of this study beyond the Lyons/Anbar research groups, we have designed a two-pronged approach for outreach in the greater Riverside-LA area. First, Lyons/Anbar/Gill will participate during each of the project years in the UCR Mentoring Summer Research Internship Program, whereby students from ethnic groups historically underrepresented in the sciences (particularly the earth sciences) will receive hands-on experience in the two labs. Second, Lyons/Anbar/Gill will work with the Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach, CA, to design an exhibit centered on the global epidemic of anthropogenic coastal hypoxia. Happily, the LA area has seen an improvement in its coastal water quality in recent years. Building from this success and lessons learned from the past--including the very deep past--we expect to reach out to the public about the health of coastal environments in an informative, optimistic, and hopefully entertaining way. Given the 1.3 million annual visitors to the aquarium, we are certain our message will spread widely.
0725416	Developmental control of mRNPs in C. elegans	IOS	ANIMAL DEVELOPMENTAL MECHANSMS	08/15/2007	05/03/2009	Thomas Evans	CO	University of Colorado at Denver	Continuing grant	Steven L. Klein	07/31/2011	$389,997.00		tom.evans@ucdenver.edu	MS F428, AMC Bldg 500	Aurora	CO	800452570	3037240090	BIO	1119	9183, BIOT	$0.00	During animal development, generation of different cell types requires that specific proteins become active only in specific cells at specific times. Many of the mRNAs that make these proteins are precisely regulated within the cell cytoplasm. These mRNAs form complexes (mRNPs) with numerous regulatory proteins that dictate rates of protein synthesis, mRNA localization, and mRNA destruction. Developmental controls must modulate these mRNP complexes, but how this is achieved is essentially a mystery. This project will explore this issue in the nematode C. elegans, a powerful experimental system. During early C. elegans development, multiple RNA-binding proteins control specific mRNPs at distinct developmental stages. Recent studies revealed that these mRNPs undergo remarkable and complex transformations during oocyte differentiation and early embryogenesis. This project's goals are to explore how these transformations arise and to understand how developmental pathways control them. The dynamic behavior of specific mRNP components will be examined directly in oocytes and embryos by tagging mRNAs and proteins with fluorescent molecules that can be seen with high-resolution microscopes. Disruption of both known and unknown genes will be done to explore how known developmental pathways influence mRNP behavior and to discover new mRNP regulators. These experimental methods can be powerfully combined in C. elegans, but not in most other organisms. Furthermore, because all C. elegans mRNP components found to date have counterparts in humans and other metazoans, this study will likely yield new insights into fundamental mechanisms common to most multicellular species including humans. In addition, this work may lead to new tools for controlling genes important for human, animal, and plant disease. Finally, this project will provide scientific training for graduate and undergraduate students, and will contribute to a high school science outreach program.

As the simultaneous recording of multiple neurons has become widespread, researchers are able to observe how neurons act in concert during these computations. However, the origin and function of observed correlations of activity across a population remain difficult to determine. The aim of this project is to develop and apply mathematical analyses of correlations within population activity, with the goal of providing a link between the activity and network structure. The first half of the project is to continue development of a method to estimate network connectivity from simultaneously recorded neurons. The unique feature of this analysis is that it explicitly accounts for effects from unmeasured neurons, an important feature since one can simultaneously measure only a small fraction of neurons. The second half of the project is to develop computational tools, based on the kinetic theory approach, to study the propagation of correlations through networks. The tools that result from this research will help neuroscientists analyze the relationship between correlations and neural network structure, providing insight into the circuitry that underlies processing within the brain.<br/><br/>The goal of this work is to develop mathematical tools that neuroscientists can use to determine how neurons in the brain are connected to each other and how those connections influence the activity of the neurons. Understanding how neurons are connected and the consequences of those connections is an important first step toward discovering how neurons communicate with each other to process information. As such knowledge may help scientists better understand the effects of the degradation of neural connections, such as in neurodegenerative disease, it may eventually lead to strategies to mitigate or reverse these effects.

To invigorate courses in discrete mathematics and computer science, this project is developing modular course materials based on primary historical sources that highlight or illuminate the discovery of certain concepts underlying finite mathematics and algorithmic thought. An initial set of twenty to twenty-five historical projects ranging from a beginning to an advanced undergraduate level comprise an interdisciplinary resource guide for use in a variety of mathematics and computer science courses. A web-based version is also available as an online resource. A network of faculty at a diverse set of institutions is classroom testing the material, with testers also signing on to create their own modules to contribute to the main resource guide. The intellectual merit of the proposal lies in providing motivation, perspective, and direction to these courses in finite mathematics, combinatorics, algorithm design, data structures, logic, abstract algebra, and automata theory via an examination of primary historical sources that compelled the development of these subjects. The broader impacts of the proposal include: external site testing at a diverse collection of institutions, from community colleges to four-year liberal arts colleges to large public universities; the development of faculty expertise in the use of historical projects; and the education of pre-service teachers in mathematics with projects. The two lead institutions also have a significant Hispanic student enrollment, which further increases the project's potential for broader impacts.

There is a need for new systems software tools to assist in effective fire management regarding where and when to deploy limited firefighting resources. This project develops an integrated data acquisition, modeling, simulation, and optimization software environment for effective wildfire management. This environment integrates real-time acquisition of weather and fire-front position data, fast simulation of fire spread to predict fire behavior, just in-time optimization to compute firefighting resource deployment, and modeling and simulation of firefighting to assess strategies of fire suppression. Integrating these components that are usually treated in isolation enables a novel comprehensive software system to effectively support real-time optimal decision-making for fire management and minimize firefighting risk and cost. Specific research objectives include developing system architecture and a software environment that integrates real time data acquisition, fire spread simulation, stochastic optimization, and firefighting simulation for dynamical data driven wildfire management, and developing runtime environment to support efficient computation and seamless communication among the different functional components in a distributed computing environment. The integrated systems software environment will provide a needed decision support tool to assist in firefighting decision making. The software environment will also serve as a valuable training and planning tool for fire management, and will provide a multidisciplinary educational tool for students and researchers at large.

The PIs' prior work in brain-computer interfaces based on functional near-infrared (fNIR) imaging has shown great promise for restoring communication and environmental control to people with such disabilities. Currently, typical control interfaces for these systems are simple discrete selection paradigms, which have proven to be effective but limited in information throughput rates. Innovative control interfaces based on continuous control paradigms, which dynamically map brain signal levels to control signals, have not been adequately studied for fNIR imaging. Depending upon the extent to which brain signals can be effectively mapped to continuous control, adding this feature to existing discrete control could significantly increase the range of tasks that can be performed by users of an fNIR-based direct brain interface (e.g., positional selection or 2-D drawing). In this work, the PIs will explore innovative direct brain-computer interfaces for continuous control and use them to develop applications for creative expression. For people with severe motor disabilities, creative expression can provide an emotional outlet as well as mental exercise to improve quality of life. The tasks inherent in creating visual art, such as drawing, coloring, and texturing, cannot be accomplished with discrete controls. Therefore, visual art provides an ideal experimental platform to study fNIR-based continuous control interfaces. It also provides an engaging and motivating platform for training that will improve users' abilities to control a direct brain interface. To these ends, the PIs will study non-traditional control interfaces for continuous and discrete selection such as wheels, dials, and gauges, to determine to what extent fNIR signals can be mapped to continuous control. The PIs will explore continuous methods for selection and control of art media such as brushes, colors, textures, and shapes, and investigate to what extent continuous brain signals can be translated into visual art gestures (drawing, shading, coloring). The advice of a professional, internationally-known artist who has ALS will guide the user requirements of the control interfaces. Quantitative and qualitative user performance data will be collected, and will among other things be used to compare learning effects with a visual art paradigm against traditional, discrete selection exercises to determine if training time and performance can be improved. Project outcomes will add to the body of knowledge for assistive technology and human-computer interfaces.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: Methods for translating cortical oxygenation signals into continuous control signals for user interfaces will have mainstream applications for assistive technologies by essentially smoothing noisy input signals. Such developments could be applied for use by those with reduced motor coordination, including the elderly, young children, and those with motor diseases such as Parkinson's disease. Mainstream users may benefit from a hands-free interface, and neural control could provide added dimensions to the creative process.

Dr. Chris Mihos of Case Western Reserve University will carry out computer simulations of galaxy clusters to study in detail how the phase-space structure of the ICL depends on the dynamical conditions in clusters and, in turn, how observational measures of ICL can best recover the underlying properties of clusters. He will examine how the evolving morphological and kinematic structure of the ICL constrains recent cluster accretion events, probe the origin of the ICL, and search for phase-space differences in the ICL formed early versus that formed late, examining also how these effects correlate with the physical origin of ICL. Additionally, he will use models to study the ICL-galaxy connection, quantifying the observational longevity of ICL streams both photometrically and kinematically, and correlating streams with individual galaxies. He will also develop techniques to tap this information, deriving trajectories of cluster galaxies and providing tests that constrain models of cluster infall and galaxy evolution.<br/><br/>The research will provide a theoretical basis for the interpretation of data from future ground- and space-based telescopes, which will produce an explosion of data that will revolutionize the study of ICL and its use in probing galaxy clusters. A large fraction of this work will constitute a graduate student Ph.D. thesis project, and undergraduates will be involved as well. The principal investigator will create visualizations of cluster simulations as part of his continuing, extensive, public outreach projects.

This project investigates: (1) dynamic metastability, (2) rare events and action minimization, (3) logarithmic Sobolev inequalities, and (4) scaling bounds in thermal convection. Via the analysis of specific model problems such as heat transport in thermal convection or stochastically induced phase transformation, the project seeks to develop new tools and identify general trends in the areas of coarsening/decay rates and random nucleation.<br/><br/>Dynamic metastability refers to systems that appear to be stable, although in fact they are far from equilibrium and will change dramatically after a long period of time. There are many problems in which the physically observed coarsening timescales are controversial, for instance certain epitaxial growth experiments; a better understanding of the connection between the statics and dynamics of complex energy landscapes can lend insight into these problems. Rare events, on the other hand, are in some sense the opposite extreme: How and at what rate does thermal noise drive systems away from energy minimizers? This work applies to problems in nanoscale magnetic memory devices, as well as diverse problems in chemistry and biology. Logarithmic Sobolev inequalities describe the trend to equilibrium in spin systems, and may be useful in the analysis of certain multi-scale numerical algorithms. Finally, thermal convection processes are important in a wide range of areas, including engineering, meteorology, oceanography, and astrophysics. The project investigates the scaling law for the Nusselt number (a nondimensional measure of heat transport), attempting to reconcile differences between the rate predicted analytically and the rate observed numerically.

Sexual selection, defined as differential reproduction due to competition over access to mates, explains phenomena including courtship displays, size differences between genders, mate choice, and gametocyte competition. The rattlebox moth (Utetheisa ornatrix) is well-suited as a model for this study because females mate preferentially based on a male-courtship pheromone. <br/><br/>Dr. Iyengar will use chemical and molecular analyses to address three fundamental issues: (1) the correlation of chemical signals to male reproductive potential; (2) whether paternity is biased towards larger males; and (3) the heritability of mating traits. The proposed projects will further our understanding of the fundamental principles of sexual selection, and will lay the foundation for future experiments that will advance the expanding, interdisciplinary field of chemical ecology. The fundamental knowledge may help us to further understand chemical signaling and reproductive traits in other species. <br/><br/>Dr. Iyengar's research program will provide numerous opportunities for both undergraduate and graduate students to participate in hypothesis-driven research that includes: laboratory work involving chemical and molecular techniques, field studies, statistical analyses, oral presentations at conferences, and submission of manuscripts to peer-reviewed journals. As a person of mixed heritage, Dr. Iyengar will serve as a positive role model, encouraging students from underrepresented groups to participate in research and actively pursue a career in the biological sciences.

Properties of ecosystems constrain the range of possible pathways for agricultural intensification, and the nature of agricultural production can influence aspects of human societies. At the same time, human societies create and develop specific systems of agricultural production that transform ecosystems, sometimes in dramatic ways. The Hawaiian Archipelago offers excellent opportunities to explore the nature and consequences of interactions among ecosystems, agricultural systems, and human societies as they played out over centuries prior to European contact. This collaborative research project will focus on intensive agriculture and society in Kohala, Hawai'i, where broad and well-defined environmental gradients encompass a large (60 km-square) and long-sustained rain-fed dryland agricultural system that was abandoned in the mid-19th century. With participation from local communities and schools, experimental gardens will be established across the range of the field system. This effort will draw on community input (traditional knowledge), archaeological observations, and ecosystem/soil analyses in addition to agricultural experimentation. Once in place, these gardens will be used to develop physiologically based agricultural crop models and to determine how the agricultural system was organized and integrated; how it was sustained for centuries prior to European contact; and how it interacted with nearby irrigated systems. This last effort will make use of strong differences in the abundances of multiple stable isotopes across the broad environmental gradient of Kohala.<br/><br/>The establishment of experimental gardens within the boundaries of the ancient and long-abandoned Kohala field system will serve several scientific and educational objectives. A well-validated crop model for dryland crops will allow much more detailed calculations of agricultural yields; these in turn will make existing models of past agricultural production and human demography across the Kohala landscape more realistic. Similarly, isotopic measurements of Hawaiian crops will support detailed interpretations of sources of food and other goods as these varied over space, time, and the social status of households in pre-contact Hawai'i. Together these efforts will make it possible to determine how this and other large, rain-fed agricultural systems functioned and how they interacted with nearby communities based on irrigated agriculture. The project therefore will contribute to understanding the evolution of complex societies. The gardens represent an extraordinary educational resource because they will make a step toward restoring an example of the main pre-contact agricultural system on the island of Hawai'i. School and community groups will make use of these gardens to learn science by conducting field experiments in a culturally meaningful setting. This project is supported by an award resulting from the NSF competition focusing on the Dynamics of Coupled Natural and Human Systems.

Teets<br/><br/>Title: Doctoral Dissertation Research: Social Networks and Public Goods: How the Type of Network Affects the Pattern of Government Expenditures<br/><br/>0720405<br/><br/>Abstract<br/><br/>This research focuses on the informal ways in which social groups articulate interests and monitor local officials in non-democracies. Unlike democracies, autocracies lack formal institutional mechanisms for citizen participation in the policy process. However, this does not mean, as some theorists have assumed, that these citizens lack interests or avenues of articulation. Through social groups such as business associations, environmental protection NGOs, clubs, and ethno-linguistic or lineage groups, citizens informally articulate preferences to local officials. Social groups embed and encircle members of a community, including local officials, and serve to set standards of appropriate behavior. These social groups allow access to local officials, as well as make available social mechanisms of monitoring and enforcing community preferences. While the researcher argues that in some cases these informal social groups can serve as substitutes for formal channels of interest articulation, these social institutions are not necessarily preferable to formal institutions. In fact, this research seeks to show how different types of social groups influence varied policy outcomes (i.e., different types of spending decisions), ranging from the capture of state resources by one group to the provision of high levels of public goods to the whole community. To show how the characteristics of social groups influence policy outcomes, the researcher tests a typology using a mixed methods approach consisting of time-series statistical analysis of public spending in 40 countries over 25 years, and a natural experiment. Constructing a natural experiment, using local government statistics and interviews from three different prefectures in China's Yunnan province, allows the researcher to hold formal institutional variables constant and vary the type of social group prevalent in each case to show the effect and weighting of each variable. The broader impact of this research is that it creates an empirical and theoretical starting point for scholars to understand how social networks operate in non-democracies as a substitute for formal mechanisms of citizen expression and accountability, which are essential for good governance.

These instruments will form the analytical infrastructure of a new Core Genomics Laboratory. The new laboratory and the instruments requested represent a significant upgrade from the existing laboratories currently used by the co-PIs. The capabilities brought about by the new facility and the requested instruments will allow co-PIs to incorporate modern genomics level experimental protocols into their current and future research and teaching activities in environmental microbiology, bioprocessing, mechanotransduction, and microstructured optical fiber spectroscopy-based biological sensors. <br/><br/>This proposal has significant intellectual merit in that it will allow the co-PIs to conduct advanced research in areas which they have well-established competence through prior work. The details of the current and several planned studies that necessitate the requested instruments are presented in the later sections of this proposal. These advanced studies will help to expand the knowledge base in the co-PIs' respective fields of expertise. <br/><br/>This proposal also has significant broader impacts. First, acquisition of the requested instruments will help develop the experimental infrastructure available to the co-PIs for research and educational purposes. By improving the ability of the co-PIs to attract funded research, more graduate students will have the opportunity to take an active role in genomics research as part of their graduate education. The co-PIs are also committed to a true integration of research into the undergraduate educational experience. Through a variety of mechanisms described in the proposal, undergraduates will have the opportunity to use the requested equipment to conduct research. Underrepresented groups, including high school students from the city of Philadelphia, will benefit as a result of the continued commitment of the co-PIs and the College of Engineering toward providing opportunities for these groups in engineering education.
0728384	Doctoral Dissertation Research: Development and Use of Social Capital in the Psychosocial Adjustment of Migrant Children	SES	SOCIOLOGY	08/15/2007	08/15/2007	Lawrence Palinkas	CA	University of Southern California	Standard Grant	Patricia White	07/31/2008	$7,500.00		palinkas@usc.edu	University Park	Los Angeles	CA	900890001	2137407762	SBE	1331	9179, SMET	$0.00	SES-0728384<br/>Lawrence Palinkas<br/>Qiaobing Wu<br/>University of Southern California <br/><br/>Along with the flood of rural residents migrating to urban areas in search of employment opportunities and better quality of life, migrant children have become one of the fastest growing segments of the population in mainland China. However, government policies designed to control the flow of migration make these children ineligible for basic social services, placing them at higher risk of developing psychosocial problems such as depression, aggression, low self-esteem, and poor life satisfaction, which may undermine their future development and cause other social problems. Unfortunately, there has been little research to date to understand their psychosocial adjustment and its social determinants. This dissertation research applies the social capital theoretical framework to investigate the psychosocial adjustment of migrant children in mainland China. It has two specific aims: 1) to identify the mechanism by which social capital embedded in the family, peer, school, and community influences the psychosocial adjustment of migrant children; and 2) to investigate how the personal agency of migrant children, that is, their initiative and actual efforts in generating and mobilizing social capital, influences the development and use of social capital as well as its effects on their psychosocial adjustment. Research questions guiding this study include: How do family, peer, school, and community social capital influence the psychosocial adjustment of migrant children in the Chinese social context? How do their effects differ from each other? How do they interact with each other through mediating or moderating pathways to exert a specific effect? And how does children's personal agency influence the functioning of social capital on their psychosocial adjustment? The study will employ a mixed-method design. Semi-structured interviews and focus groups will be conducted first to develop and refine measures of social capital and children's personal agency. Then a survey will be conducted with 810 4th-9th grade migrant children in Shanghai, home to the largest population of rural migrants living in urban areas of China. <br/><br/>This dissertation research will advance social capital theory by illuminating the multidimensional nature of social capital and its effects, and by clarifying the role of the child's personal agency in the functioning of social capital on child psychosocial adjustment. It also advances the theory by validating it in a non-western socio-cultural context, thus potentially enhancing its universal applicability. A better understanding of the function of social capital will be informative for policymakers and practitioners charged with allocating limited resources and efforts in a most efficient way to promote the health and well-being of migrant children. Understanding the role of the child's personal agency will be critical in developing programs that encourage migrant children to engage more in the relationships within their family, peer, school, and community, thus building the stock of social capital for the enhancement of their well-being, as well as for the good of society. The knowledge and implications for policy and practice are not limited to China, but are informative and applicable to the United States and other nations impacted by migration. Finally, the research process will also facilitate building stronger connections with scholars and institutions in mainland China, which paves the way for future research collaborations in broader areas.

In various contexts, the development of environmental science, such as community forestry, has been enriched with the collaborations of forestry scholars with non-governmental organizations (NGOs), public pressure groups, community-based organizations, and local people. Nevertheless, the social possibilities of their work have been largely understudied. Basic lack of understanding about the relationship between scholars and civil society relates to a more general pattern of analysis of environment and development that positions academic forestry scholars and professional foresters merely as an apparatus of state power. This doctoral dissertation research project will investigate the cultural aspects and spatial dynamics of collaboration between social movements and forestry science in Indonesia. The doctoral candidate plans to study the complex and contradictory position of Indonesian academic foresters in order to understand their social, political, and scholarly framing of forests, how they mediate their political position and knowledge with the state, capital, and social movements, and how this position has affected the constitution of community-managed forests as an object of knowledge. The student will study the adoption of gendered local knowledge promoted by and circulated within social movements into academic forestry science as well as the possible role of alternative forestry science in shaping social movements. The doctoral candidate will use a multi-sited ethnographic approach to follow key figures and institutions across scales that are local, national, and transnational in nature. Specific methods that will be used include participant-observation, structured and open-ended interviews, and archival research including historical study.<br/><br/>This dissertation research will examine the complex interaction between culture, power, and material realities within collaborations between academic scholars and members of social movements. The project will move beyond place-based studies of traditional ecological knowledge to explore how natural scientific knowledge fits in to complex social and political processes. The research will investigate issues of practical importance for ongoing societal relations in the developing world by describing important intersections of natural scientific knowledge and political action. By examining the knowledge, actions, and cultures of academic forestry scholars in line with their alliance with members of social-justice-oriented environmental movements, this project will provide significant contributions to basic understanding of how to effectively integrate natural scientific knowledge with civil society and politics. As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.

The first challenge is to represent the group behavior as the interaction of the behavior of individuals. This interaction can be complex, with coordinated behavior being: simultaneous, sequential, or temporally separated; driven primarily by a prearranged script or through signaling cues (e.g.,<br/>visual, auditory, and electronic); and spatially localized or distributed. Lastly, the breadth of possible coordinated behavior requires strategies to create robust representations. The PIs will develop a sensor-independent symbolic description of human behavior that is readily derivable from sensor data yet can be algorithmically manipulated. This effort will develop a comprehensive framework for inferring behavior of individuals and groups of individuals using hierarchical interpretation of probabilistic context free grammars, a formalism originally developed for speech understanding. This framework will take low-level sensor measurements such as location, motion and interaction with the environment to hierarchically construct models of what is happening in the physical world, exploiting analogs between behavior understanding and speech understanding. The second challenge is to develop strategies to manage computational complexity, both the selection complexity of identifying an unknown number of conspirators out of a large background population, and the association complexity of managing the uncertainty of associating the newly observed individual behaviors with established behavioral trajectories, given imperfect tracking of individuals. Multiple strategies will be developed and applied to address this challenge. The selection complexity will be addressed by clustering the population into sub-populations based on statistical metrics, behavior classification, spatial distance, and line-of-sight constraints. The association complexity will be addressed by exploiting unique features of conspiratorial behaviors to relax the requirements on perfect data association in tracking. Successful development of these capabilities will have substantial benefits to the automated monitoring, analysis and classification of group behaviors in many potential application domains. These application domains include crowd assessment and control, riot prevention/response, prison safety, VIP protection, and building/installation defense. In addition, the algorithms and strategies developed will apply to group behaviors that are not limited to physical movements, but can extend to other forms of behavior, such as electronic communication, financial transactions, and purchasing behavior.

Some examples include detecting motion model changes in target tracking or positioning applications; or detecting abnormal shape changes in computer vision/biomedical image analysis applications. In all of the above, the state is not directly observed. The observation is a noise-corrupted and nonlinear function of the state. The effectiveness of particle filters for such nonlinear/non-Gaussian tracking problems is already well known. Often, the changed system model is not known, i.e. the change or abnormality is not characterized. For example, the change may be a gradual one, for a constant velocity target slowly accelerating to a higher speed, or a sudden one. The approach is based on particle filter based algorithms for ``slow and ?sudden?, unknown parameter, change detection. Robust design strategies will be developed and tested for realistic applications.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: <br/><br/>Most existing approaches can be classified as either based on adaptive filtering ideas or based on loss-of-track detection. Adaptive filtering approaches are either expensive or unreliable to implement. Loss-of-track based approaches detect abrupt changes almost immediately. However, slow changes, which result in a small loss of track per unit time, usually take a long time to get detected, or sometimes get missed. We propose a novel approach that utilizes the fact that slow changes get partially tracked, and uses this ``tracked part of the change for detection using particle filters.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: <br/><br/>The developed algorithms will impact a large number of positioning, navigation or defense applications that require target tracking; video based surveillance applications that require abnormal behavior detection; biomedical signal/image sequence analysis applications where detected abnormalities can be indicators of disease, as well as many other applications in econometrics, finance, robotics and vision. Educational initiatives will include introduction of a graduate class on Adaptive filtering and Monte Carlo methods; modification of existing undergraduate classes; and senior design projects to implement and compare different shape extraction techniques for various applications.

An early step in this analysis of the auditory scene is the perceptual grouping of the acoustic mixture reaching the ear into coherent representations of sound sources (= Auditory Stream Segregation). This process has been described in a variety of vertebrates. Although auditory scene analysis has been intensively studied in a variety of systems, the understanding of the neuronal processes underlying auditory scene analysis remains limited, and testable neuronal models of auditory stream segregation are currently not available. Recently, auditory stream segregation has been described in one invertebrate system: a katydid auditory interneuron (TN-1) segregates information about bat echolocation cries from a background of male communication calls. This project investigates the neuronal mechanisms underlying auditory stream segregation by TN-1 in katydids (Insecta, Tettigoniidae). Ultimately, the goal is to establish a neuron model to study auditory stream segregation at the levels of ion-channels, cells and networks. <br/><br/>The first part of the project determines the importance of the behavioral context for auditory stream segregation in this system. The segregation performance is compared behaviorally between females that are either receptive or non-receptive to male calls. The second part of the study identifies the mechanisms underlying the suppression of TN-1 responses to male calls, using intracellular recordings from TN-1 dendrites. Changes in membrane conductance are measured in response to adapting stimuli under various experimental situations. The third part of the study tests whether the processes leading to the suppression of responses to male calls occur only in restricted areas of the dendrite, using measurements of membrane conductance and calcium or sodium imaging. This project establishes a new model system and a novel hypothesis to the study of auditory scene analysis and sensory processing in general. It is therefore likely to be an important contribution to neurobiology. <br/><br/>This project includes a direct transfer from research to education: the experimental setup for behavioral tests and extracellular recordings is modified to be suitable for classroom teaching at undergraduate or high school level. This project includes training of several undergraduate and graduate students as well as a postdoctoral associate. This project is part of a larger effort at the University of Missouri to establish graduate and undergraduate training in computational neuroscience.

Graduate and undergraduate, postdoctoral, and faculty researchers will use this capability to collect multi-channel maps of Raman scattering, cathodoluminescence, and photoluminescence spectroscopy, and electron microscopy and analysis with spatial correlation, and in high-vacuum, variable-pressure or environmental mode. Enhanced by a heating and cooling stage, the system will be used to provide spatially correlated images of local structure and phenomena, properties and fields. These include chemistry, structural phase, composition, strain, electronic carrier concentration, and carrier diffusion lengths in surface and near-surface nanostructures, thin-film and bulk materials and devices. By linking multiple quantitative mapping capabilities with multiple stimuli, the instrument will impact a diverse range of research activities, including those involving biomaterials and biosensors, nano-scale electronic, photonic and plasmonic materials and devices, materials design, and materials for applications in renewable energy technologies. The system will be used as a demonstration and teaching platform in undergraduate and graduate lecture and laboratory courses and in seminars on correlated microscopic and spectroscopic data and analysis. The tool will also be used in educational outreach activities, including programs that engage undergraduates from other institutions, and secondary-school mathematics and science teachers in summer-long research experiences.<br/><br/>Non-technical Abstract<br/>This scientific imaging and spectroscopic instrumentation will combine different materials characterization and device probing methods to provide researchers with multi-channel scanning optical, electrical and electron-beam based imaging and analysis capabilities within a single tool. With this system, researchers will simultaneously probe, spatially resolve and correlate several attributes of materials, devices and biological systems on the scale of a hundred times smaller than a human hair, and in different gas environments and at different temperatures. Included among these are micro-structure and topology, chemistry, chemical bonding, mechanical stress and stiffness, and the behavior of electrons and the color of light emitted, reflected or scattered. This tool will allow researchers to design, develop and evaluate the performance of new materials and devices for applications ranging from environmental monitoring to medical diagnostics and drug delivery, from eco-friendly energy production and storage to high-performance materials for vehicles, ships and aircraft. This equipment and results obtained using it will also be integral parts of undergraduate and graduate curricula in lectures, laboratory modules, and demonstrations in which students learn to apply multi-channel spectroscopic mapping methods to design and analysis. The instrument will also be used in educational outreach activities, including programs that engage undergraduates from other institutions, and secondary-school mathematics and science teachers in summer-long research experiences. Finally, this capability will facilitate new interactions between industrial collaborators and Drexel faculty and their student researchers through industry co-op positions and senior design projects. These interactions among students, faculty and industrial collaborators will provide additional context for their education and research training, further strengthening Drexel's long tradition of excellence in providing co-operative educational experience.

The project attacks several<br/>critical issues involved in the new generation of smart civil infrastructure system with built-in sensor<br/>network. Performance assessment of civil infrastructure is usually a long-term task (i.e. several years) the<br/>power supply for the sensor network becomes a problem, especially for the embedded sensors in<br/>structures. The first focus is to provide a reliable energy harvesting method for the sensors and a power<br/>management plan for the sensor network.

To this end, this project is to develop<br/>an integrated Power Aware Sensor-Simulation Network system for long-term performance<br/>assessment of concrete infrastructures. The system consists of three subsystems<br/>including an energy harvesting and power management system for the sensors, a combined sensor-based<br/>numerical simulation system, and a massively parallel computing system for the numerical calculations.<br/>Built-in sensors have found their applications not only in civil, and aerospace structures, but<br/>also in mechanical engineering and medical devices such as artificial hearts.

Electron cryo-microscopy (cryoEM) is the most appropriate structural tool to determine molecular structures of biological nanomachines that generally consist of multiple protein subunits and/or nucleic acids with a total mass greater than 0.5 million Daltons. The goal is to develop information discovery and integration methodologies for deriving atomic models of nanomachines. Such models will be derived from 3-dimensional (3-D) cryoEM mass density function (i.e. a volumetric density map) in conjunction with physics of protein folding and informatics data. This project is made possible by an integration of the expertise of five investigators in computer graphics, computational biophysics, structural informatics and cryoEM. The intellectual merit of this research is highlighted by the computational approaches of extracting structural information from low-resolution, complex cryoEM volume densities and integrating this information into classical protein structure modeling paradigms, such as comparative modeling and ab initio modeling, for understanding biological nanomachines. The three research goals involve information discovery, information integration and validation of the proposed algorithms. The proposed research will have significant impacts in three disparate disciplines: computer science, molecular modeling, and cryoEM. Furthermore, the team will disseminate their resulting tools freely to the academic community and will host a workshop towards the end of the project. To enhance the impact of their research, the investigators will integrate research with education at each member institution with an eye towards diversity. In particular, these investigators will develop a virtual didactic course in modeling of biological nanomachines for graduate and senior undergraduate students at the five participating institutions.

Admin.	Princeton	NJ	085442020	6092583090	MPS	7334	0000, OTHR	$0.00	Embryonic development is driven by highly regulated spatial and temporal patterns of gene expression. These patterns emerge in a sequential process, with simple patterns providing inputs to molecular networks, which, in turn, transform these inputs into more complex outputs. Due to the recent advances in the molecular studies of development, these networks can now be modeled at mechanistic level. Exploring complex mechanistic models is critically dependent on the use of computational techniques; at the same time, the behavior of large-scale models can often be understood through analysis of simplified models, providing a bridge between computational and real experiments. Rigorous mathematical techniques for analyzing the dynamics of signal processing in developmental patterning are yet to be developed. To this end, the PIs propose to pursue a number of analytical approaches for studying the spatiotemporal dynamics in patterning networks. These approaches, which rely heavily on the techniques from the calculus of variations, will be applied in the context of epithelial pattern formation in the Drosophila egg, an established experimental model for studying how simple inputs establish complex spatial patterns in development. The proposed analytical and computational work will build on the modeling and experimental results obtained by the PIs during the previous funding period. Within the framework of this application, the PIs will focus on signal processing by two-dimensional patterning networks with positive feedback loops.<br/><br/>The proposed research is closely linked to the experimental work on pattern formation mediated by the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR), a key regulator of epithelial tissues across species. Given the highly conserved nature of EGFR signaling and the generality of inductive patterning events, the work of the PIs will provide insights into a large class of development problems. In addition, the mathematical techniques developed in this proposal will be applicable to a wide range of problems modeled by nonlinear parabolic partial differential equations. This research is strongly aligned with the educational effort of the PIs that involves further development of undergraduate and graduate courses on mathematical biology of cell communication systems and interdisciplinary training of mathematics and engineering graduate and undergraduate students at NJIT and Princeton.

ESR scientists presently conduct their research using networked, single-processor PCs. These facilities have fallen well behind the demands of their research interests. Access to the MPC would significantly enhance existing programs, and would open up research areas that are presently inaccessible to ESR. The proposed MPC is a 40-core (20 dual-core AMD Opteron processors) system arranged in 4 processors per node. The system scale is set by both budget and infrastructure (power and air conditioning) requirements. The MPC would be owned and operated by ESR and would be available to ESR scientists and, as load levels permit, to project collaborators at other institutions. <br/>The proposed system would significantly enhance the contribution of ESR scientists to studies of topical interest including: <br/>. tidal influence on ocean mixing and sea-ice properties in polar seas, and ice/ocean interactions at the base of Antarctic ice shelves; <br/>. analysis of the quasi-global and high-resolution distribution of upper ocean currents and mixing on daily timescales, and short-range forecast of the surface currents; and <br/>. the role of anticyclonic eddies in modifying convective ventilation. <br/>The MPC would assist in these studies by allowing expanded model runs to better represent processes that require extremely long run times on their existing single-CPU computers. Computationally demanding tasks include: modeling internal tides and density outflows in regions of steep topography (where fine grid spacing is essential); coupling tides to seasonal and longer changes in wind-forced and thermohaline flows (requiring longer integration times); explicitly representing sea ice in ocean and coupled ice-shelf/ocean models (a factor of 2-3 increase in CPU needs relative to ocean-only models); and increasing the sophistication of turbulence closure models for both high latitude and quasi-global upper-ocean studies.

The main approach will be to use optical Kerr effect (OKE) spectroscopy to probe RTIL dynamics. The first part of the research deals with the behavior of RTILs in the bulk phase, and addresses the following questions: (1) How do the intermolecular dynamics differ in RTILs when nanostructural organization is absent? (2) If charge ordering plays a key role in determining the intermolecular dynamics of binary mixtures, will the OKE spectra of mixtures be nonadditive if the RTIL components have a common cation but different anions of the same size? (3) Is there a temperature above which temperature-independent OKE spectra become temperature-dependent? (4) Will binary mixtures still be nanostructurally organized if the RTIL components have a common anion but cations with different alkyl chain lengths? The second part of the research deals with the behavior of RTILs in nanoporous silica sol-gel glasses. The issues to be addressed here are whether RTILs that are nanostructurally organized in the bulk phase still maintain that organization in the silica sol-gel glass pores, and whether the nanostructural organization, if it exists, can be controlled by varying pore size or modifying the chemical nature of the pore surface. Outcomes are expected to shed light on the understanding of structure-function relationships in RTILs, and therefore impact technologically important areas where there is growing interest in electrolytes with high conductivity and good mechanical stability, and in the study of nanoliquid catalysis.<br/><br/>The properties of RTILs make them potential replacements for many volatile organic liquids currently in use as solvents. Industrial use of ionic liquid solvents could eliminate the health and environmental risks that are posed by volatile solvents currently in common use. The understanding of the structure-function relationships of RTILs in the studies will be of practical used to those who seek to understand ionic liquids and tailor them for specific applications. Beyond the technological benefits, this project includes a strong educational component that will provide research training to undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral researchers. The PI has developed a pilot program to recruit underrepresented minority students who will participate in summer undergraduate research activities in his group at Texas Tech.

The goal of the project is to exploit the utility of these metals in the efficient preparation of organic molecules that are of practical value to synthetic chemists. Three specific areas of study will be focused upon: (i) developing alkaline earth metal reagents to mediate enantioselective deprotonation reactions, (ii) exploring the synthesis and synthetic utility of alkaline earth chargeseparated complexes, and (iii) examining the preparation and functionality of geminal diorganometallic complexes. The strategies adopted will uncover fundamental aspects concerning the synthesis, structures, reactivities, selectivities and mechanisms of action of the reagents developed. <br/><br/>With this renewal award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Professor Kenneth W. Henderson, of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of Notre Dame. The main goal of the project is to develop new methods and reagents for synthetic organic chemistry, exploiting the unusual reactivity of the heavier congeners (e.g., calcium) of the more commonly encountered lithium- and magnesium-containing reagents. In turn, the developed methods may be applied to the synthesis of biologically active compounds for use in areas of central importance to the US economy such as the agrochemical and pharmaceutical industries. In addition, the metals of interest are generally inexpensive, nontoxic and environmentally benign, which makes their use attractive in industrial settings.

The relatively weak westward flow is part of an anticyclonic, or counterclockwise, circulation north of the ACC and a cyclonic, or clockwise, circulation south of the ACC. Recent imaging developed from the World Ocean Circulation Hydrographic Program suggests that a strong cyclonic gyre exists, representing a newly discovered general circulation feature in a remote and unexplored region of the Southern Ocean. <br/><br/>Oceanographers from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute will install a 6-mooring array of current meters and a subsurface profiling float across the Antarctic continental slope to map the circulation of this newly discovered cyclonic gyre. In addition, scientists will use moored profilers to monitor the flow of the dense plume of water associated with the ACC that sinks along the continental slope and joins the descending limb of the Meridional Overturning Circulation. <br/><br/>Findings from this study will resolve uncertainties about the nature of the general circulation in the Southern Ocean and enhance our understanding of the global meridional overturning system. This project will also impact climate change research by allowing scientists to combine the proposed measurements with high-resolution numerical modeling to improve the performance of coupled climate models. Funding from this proposal will support the development of an early-career scientist, as well as potential research and training for a UK-based PhD student.

Experiments will determine the role of granivores in lowering the populations of desert annuals and determine when seeds die during the year. Models will be constructed to determine the role of soil seed banks in buffering populations and how species differences promote coexistence and species diversity. Calibrating the 25 year data set with weather data will permit predictions of biotic responses to climate change.<br/><br/>Desert annual plants have played an important role as model organisms in understanding how organisms adapt to variable and unpredictable environments.

Among these lakes, however, Lake Tanganyika is distinctive in the extent to which its other taxa have also diversified: over 350 unique non-cichlid species are found within this lake. Tanganyika is therefore a unique ecosystem for studying processes of endemic diversification: how is it that some taxa have diversified so dramatically within this single lake? One hypothesis is that substrate heterogeneity in the littoral zone allows taxa to ecologically specialize on specific substrates, and isolation between subpopulations in this heterogeneous environment creates the potential for speciation. Although this hypothesis for within-lake allopatric speciation was first proposed over 25 years ago, its role in creating patterns of species diversity within the East African rift lakes remains largely untested. If isolation of populations through substrate specificity and limited dispersal among habitat patches has driven diversification, it is hypothesized that species from groups with high endemic diversity will show evidence of restricted gene flow between populations. This research will investigate this hypothesis in two unrelated groups that have produced substantial endemic radiations in Lake Tanganyika: Lavigeria gastropods, and cichlid fishes of the tribe Tropheini. Study species of cichlid fishes and snails are all benthic herbivores restricted to rocky substrates. This obligate habitat association, coupled with their notably high lake-wide species diversity, suggests that ecological specialization on rocky substrate has promoted speciation in both snail and cichlid groups. Therefore, ecological specialization may drive parallel genetic subdivision of populations and diversification in multiple unrelated taxonomic groups. To test these hypotheses, both mitochondrial DNA sequence and microsatellite data will be used to analyze comparative patterns of population genetic structuring in cichlids and snails along the heterogeneous shoreline bordering Kigoma, Tanzania. Understanding the impact that ecological specialization has on gene flow dynamics and patterns of diversity across these taxa will allow the testing of important, long-standing questions about the processes of diversification among Lake Tanganyika's exceptionally diverse faunas.

The goal is to have the hybrid model take into account physics that is missing from the low-dimension analytic model. Three different approaches will be investigated. The first suggested configuration involves replacing significant portions of the low-order model that are already dedicated to calculating plasma pressure with a single black box model. The second proposed configuration would replace only a relatively small nonlinear unloading function embedded in the previously mentioned pressure calculation with a black box model. The last configuration will assume the physics in WINDMI are mostly correct, and use a nonlinear black box model to correct for residual errors. This hybrid model will be trained using a genetic nonlinear optimization algorithm to predict the AL and Dst indices using ACE solar wind data as input. The result will be a model of the magnetosphere that can predict the Dst and AL magnetic indices with high accuracy.

In such settings, many existing algorithms may perform poorly or may have high overhead while inefficiently consuming energy. One approach is to utilize mobile sensors in these situations, such as sensors with wheels. However, mobile wheeled sensors may not be able to move to the desired locations in the areas of difficult terrain with obstacles. Wheeled sensors can also be very expensive. A hopping sensor is a type of mobile sensor with a bionic mobility design that is inspired by creatures, such as grasshoppers. These sensors are still at an interesting concept stage. This proposal addresses the design, prototyping, and evaluation of hopping sensors and efficient algorithms for sensor deployment in difficult areas and rugged terrain. We focus on four research issues that are critical to the effective deployment and management of large scale sensor networks in such settings: robust and power-efficient hopping sensors, sensor localization, sensor coverage, and deployment of a self-adaptive all terrain sensor networks equipped with the hopping sensors and the proposed algorithms, which is called LEAPNet. Most future sensor networks are likely to be deployed in our targeted environments, and hence this research will benefit real-world applications such as monitoring ecosystems, disaster relief, and military reconnaissance. Strong collaborative efforts will be made to provide efficient and practical solutions with solid engineering designs and strong algorithmic foundations for this purpose. In addition, an innovative integration of the proposed research and education program will provide students with analytical skills and hands-on experiences by emerging technologies, which will better prepare them for strong technical careers in this rapidly growing and changing area.

The new camera, SCUBA-2, speeds up the mapping of wide fields by almost three orders of magnitude, and will dramatically expand understanding of the sub-millimeter Universe and the history of dusty star formation. This project will carry out a SCUBA-2 survey of two heavily studied fields of the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey (GOODS), during weather conditions suitable for observing at a wavelength of 450-microns. Since the confusion limit is lower at this wavelength, which is shorter than other wavelengths used, these data will be able to (i) measure the more typical sources contributing to the sub-millimeter background, (ii) measure fluxes close to the rest wavelength peak of the blackbody distribution, and (iii) obtain much more accurate positions for the sources. Combining the sub-millimeter data with radio, infrared, optical, and X-ray data, from space and from the ground, will determine the multi-wavelength properties of the distant, heavily dust-obscured sources, and provide accurate positions for spectroscopic follow-up. The research will determine redshifts, luminosities, and star formation rates, and thus trace the extent and evolution of obscured star formation in the distant Universe.<br/><br/>Understanding the star formation history of the universe is a major goal of modern astronomy, and of great public interest. This research will inform popular science articles, web sites, and frequent talks to broad sections of the technical and lay communities. Previous data collected by these investigators have been made available to the community and have proved valuable for many outside projects: this practice of regular release will continue with the new survey data. Both investigators continue to promote diversity and cultural interaction at their respective institutions, including students from throughout the Pacific arena (in Hawaii), and a strong effort to involve women (in Wisconsin), who remain a vastly under-represented group.

By being able to image how atoms cluster together, scientists are able to understand and thereby engineer materials for improved energy conversion, electrical conduction or magnetic data storage. The University of Alabama (UA) has key research programs in these and other areas that require this type of atomic level imaging. UA researchers are working on coatings that can improve the life cycle for turbine blades used in advanced power generators and aircraft engines. Additionally, faculty researchers have sponsored efforts in developing materials for fuel cells. UA houses a government and industrial sponsored magnetic recording research center. This center has active programs in developing materials for high storage densities, high sensitivity sensors and faster logic devices, such as transistors. Most of these materials for these new technologies use oxide-based materials, which are poor electrical conductors. Historically, atom probes required materials that were electrically conductive (metals). Recent advances in laser pulsing has allowed atom probes to image poor electrical conductors, such as semiconductors and insulators. The requested laser attachment to UA's atom probe will subsequently expand the range of materials that can be characterized in these strategic programs. The laser attachment provides a unique capability in fostering collaboration with several regional institutions, including historically black colleges and universities. Additionally, it serves in recruitment of students into the materials science discipline at UA. <br/><br/>Technical: The ability to pin-point an individual atom in a three-dimensional microstructure has become an essential need in materials characterization to link experimental observations to atomic scale modeling. The atom probe instrument field evaporates atoms from a specimen of interest which are collected on a position-sensitive, mass-spectrum detector. By reconstructing the trajectory path and impact position of each ion, a volumetric reconstructed rendering of the material is generated with near atomic precision for each individual atom. Historically, atom probe specimens needed to be conductive in order for the high voltage pulse to propagate to the apex of the specimen to field evaporate the surface atoms. The commercial advent of the laser now allows poor conductors (ceramics and semiconductors) to be thermally assisted in the evaporation process. The University of Alabama (UA) has several research programs that utilize dielectric materials. The ability to characterize these materials by atom probe microscopy would significantly advance these programs. For example, UA's efforts on high-k dielectric HfO2 for next-generation gate-values has shown that nitrogen-doping can significantly reduce intermixing between HfO2 and Si; however, an underlying understanding has been hampered by the inability to characterize subtle composition changes at the interface. UA has a track-record of being leaders in spintronic research for giant magnetoresistance sensors and tunneling magnetoresistance devices. The atom probe's ability to characterize buried oxide interfaces within these thin film stacks would further facilitate our linkage between measured properties and modeling. The laser would also allow us to field evaporate brittle intermetallics, like FePt, that are candidates for ultrahigh magnetic storage media. Finally, UA has active energy-based research programs. The laser attachment to our atom probe would allow us to characterize PtRu alloys on their catalytic support structures, such as graphite and alumina. Similarly, the laser will increase the capability to characterize oxide scale formation in thermal protective coatings used for power generation turbine blades. UA's supporting infrastructure and personnel is exceptionally well equipped to develop atom probe specimens and advance the usage of the laser to a wide range of materials. The increased capability will maintain UA as a national analytical facility and continue to foster our existing outreach research activities with HBCU institutions.

The BGS is recognized as the leading international annual conference focused specifically on geomorphology. It brings together leading geomorphologists in many subfields, and its prior collected papers include widely cited classics that have affected the course of research in geomorphology and related sciences. Although 'complexity' is an umbrella that has expanded considerably from its origins in nonlinear dynamics (e.g. Chaos Theory), common threads include complicated behavior arising from simple interactions, and the emergence of overall order and patterns from myriad local interactions. <br/><br/>In the past 20 years, 'complex systems' approaches and perspectives have infiltrated into many disparate branches of geomorphology, leading to fundamentally new insights about how landforms develop and evolve. The symposium will provide an intellectual environment where the participants can review, debate, discuss, and synthesize conceptual paradigms, appropriate methods, linkages between theories and observations, and instructional frameworks for future complexity-in-geomorphology research. An integrated forum such as the BGS is extremely crucial for this endeavor. Complex-systems approaches include diverse theoretical and data-analysis methods developed in different fields including physics, mathematics, and ecology, as well as in the Earth sciences. The broad field of geomorphology includes researchers with a range of backgrounds and expertise using a range of complementary complex-systems approaches. In addition, two communities of geomorphologists exist--consisting respectively of geographers on one hand and mostly geologists and engineers on the other--both using complex-systems concepts in various ways, but attending different meetings with far too little cross-fertilization. The proposed symposium will integrate researchers and students from these various backgrounds, to facilitate interactions likely to lead to the generation of new ideas both during and after the event. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: In an era of increasing interactions between changing human land use, changing climate, landscape evolution, and ecosystems on many scales, the basic-science tools and ideas likely to result from the symposium will facilitate more effective planning and management of land use, hazard mitigation, and ecological/geomorphological restorations. In addition, this symposium will showcase the research of many scholars and practitioners, including junior scientists, women, and workers from different disciplinary backgrounds. This showcase will have a high level of quality-controlled rigor, with the published papers undergoing a thorough peer-review process and publication in a special issue of the international journal Geomorphology. Finally, the core set of ideas, methods, and goals on the subject of geomorphology will provide the basis for a new organization of teaching in the geosciences. <br/><br/>Conference Organization: The BGS 2007 will be hosted by the Nicholas School of the Environment and Earth Sciences at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina (5-7 October 2007).
0726836	Doctoral Dissertation Research: Globalization and Job Movement in the Automobile Industry, 1970-2006	SES	SOCIOLOGY	08/15/2007	08/15/2007	Beverly Silver	MD	Johns Hopkins University	Standard Grant	Patricia White	07/31/2009	$7,500.00		silver@jhu.edu	3400 N CHARLES ST	Baltimore	MD	212182608	4105168668	SBE	1331	9179, SMET	$0.00	Title: Doctoral Dissertation Research: Globalization and Job Movement in the Automobile Industry, 1970-2006<br/>Institution: Johns Hopkins University<br/>Principal Investigator: Beverly Silver<br/>Co-Principal Investigator: Nicole Aschoff<br/><br/>A recurrent theme expressed in academia, policy circles and the popular media is that globalization has a 'devastating and inescapable' impact on high-wage manufacturing jobs. Scholars argue that manufacturing jobs are moving to low-wage sites at breakneck speed, leaving behind a wasteland of joblessness and insecurity in countries like the U.S. Yet, the case of the global auto industry belies this stark picture. Automobile manufacturers are both moving into and out of high wage countries. In particular, foreign auto firms are investing heavily in the U.S. where wages are among the highest in the world. What explains this anomalous pattern of job movement in the auto industry? Why are companies continuing to build and expand plants in the U.S. despite the close proximity of low wage sites like Mexico? This dissertation will address these questions through a detailed study of capital mobility in the U.S. auto industry. Drawing on research in historical sociology, labor, geography and political economy of the world system, this dissertation will produce a detailed picture of the overall pattern of automobile job movement into and out of the U.S. over the past three decades, and provide the most plausible explanation for the pattern uncovered. The project will utilize a mixed-methods approach that includes the construction of a time-series database that tracks plant movement into and out of the U.S. since 1970, and the completion of two extended case studies of automotive component manufacturers. <br/><br/>The findings of this research will be of interest to sociologists, and to workers and policy makers in both developed and developing countries for three main reasons: First, the project will provide much needed empirical evidence for evaluating current debates amongst social scientists studying job movement, globalization and labor movements. Second, it will provide a conceptually grounded framework for analyzing job movement; this framework challenges the primacy of wages and labor costs in determining where jobs move by considering the complex interaction of local, national and global factors in shaping the geographical trajectories of auto firms. As a result, the dissertation will help automobile workers to assess the possibilities and constraints in organizing for better working conditions in today's political-economic climate. Finally, the project has important policy implications, given that job movement and outsourcing are of crucial interest in both developed and developing countries. By studying broad patterns of job movement and the inner mechanisms of agency that determine these patterns, the dissertation will provide a better understanding of where jobs are moving and the reasons why they are moving there. This is an essential step in developing policies that attract and sustain quality jobs in an increasingly competitive global economy.

It has become a common trend for many fab-less companies and government agencies to ship their designs offshore for low-cost fabrication. These trends have raised serious concerns regarding possible threats or attacks on US military systems, critical sites and even household appliances that rely on high performance chips. There are various potential vulnerabilities to such systems caused by malicious alterations of hardware processes that might make these vital systems inoperable at some future time. Such malicious manipulation of ICs slated for installation in US weapon systems cannot be tolerated.<br/><br/>The focus of this research is on the development of automatic test pattern generation (ATPG) and signal analysis techniques for detecting and locating malicious alterations, e.g. the insertion of Trojan circuits, during wafer probe aor package test as a means of improving the level of trustworthiness of the chip. In particular, techniques that significantly improve the resolution of quiescent current and transient current techniques for detecting and locating Trojan circuits are investigated. A second focus of the project is on the development of ATPG methods designed to detect hidden alterations of the chip, e.g., inserted or weakened wires or transistors which cause the chip to fail later in the field.

To identify and attribute pollution transport events, FLEXPART particle dispersion model simulations of the transport of anthropogenic and boreal wildfire emissions to Pico will be conducted, and all events with observed anthropogenic impacts and minimal boreal fire impacts will be analyzed. Tropospheric O3, CO, and NO2 from the TES, OMI, and SCIAMACHY satellite sensors will be analyzed to assess the importance of the sampled events relative to the total column. Data will be analyzed in conjunction with GEOS-Chem chemical transport model (CTM) simulations to evaluate the ability of the CTM to simulate observed absolute and relative enhancements in measured species and to probe the consistency between observations and simulated photochemistry and mixing. New techniques will be used that combine high-resolution FLEXPART simulations with CTM output to obtain a semi-Lagrangian sampling of CTM simulations in pollution transport events. By analyzing multiple events over two summer seasons, the data will be used to quantify the contribution of such events to large-scale impacts of continental outflow on O3 and O3 precursors.<br/> This work will lead to reduced uncertainties in estimates of the impacts of anthropogenic and boreal fire emissions on tropospheric O3. It will provide new information on variability in remote lower free tropospheric O3 and PAN resulting from inter-annual variability in boreal fire activity. This project will contribute to teaching and training by providing a doctoral research topic for one graduate student as well as an undergraduate research project; through the sharing of research findings with high school teachers in the Azores; and through a web site. It will enhance research infrastructure by maintaining the Pico station during a period of transition to a permanent Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) station. A Pico GAW station would be a valuable resource for the atmospheric science community for long-term monitoring of atmospheric composition and trans-Atlantic pollution transport, and as a base for research intensives.

Significant demands exist for new drugs to treat contractility disorders involving skeletal muscle. Myomics' proposed drug testing platform will contribute to significant reductions in time and costs associated with bringing new drugs to market by discovering drug candidates and eliminating ineffective compounds earlier than currently possible. Unlike existing systems, this approach incorporates biomechanics into drug discovery using mechanical sensors to detect contraction of multiple identical tissue samples over extended time periods. Significant socioeconomic and quality-of-life impacts will result for patients with contractility disorders (sarcopenia, atrophy, or Duchennes muscular dystrophy). While most drug screening protocols test one protein pathway at a time, this platform provides a unique physiological screening system and protocol which quantifies contraction as the result of multiple protein pathways interacting over time. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of this research will be to enhance muscle contractility disorder/disease research and provide new tools to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries for drug discovery. Upon successful development, the sensing mechanism will potentially be used to develop treatments for several contractile tissues relevant to a range of important human contractile disorders and diseases contributing to improved outcomes for these diseases.

Lewis of Connecticut College and Bansi L. Kalra of Hollins University, Roanoke, VA. This research will involve investigation of the chemical mechanism of various important classes of organic chemical reactions. Reactions to be studied include isomerizations of cyclopropanes, dehydration of alcohols and dissociations of cyclic alkenes. Gaseous samples containing reactants will be heated over wide ranges of temperature in shock tube- and static-reactors, to obtain accurate measurements of energy and entropy barriers to the reactions. Further, the relative rates of competing isomerization and/or decomposition reaction pathways will be also be determined. The identification of specific reaction pathways will be facilitated by labeling specific sites of the reactant molecules with stable isotopes, either deuterium or carbon-13 atoms, and determining where these labels finish up in the product molecules. A custom-designed ultrahigh resolution laser spectrometer will be used for that analysis.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of this research involve the training of the next generation of scientists; in particular, this research is being carried out with undergraduate students. For the majority of these students it will be their first exposure to state-of-the-art research and, as in the past, it is anticipated that these students will develop an enthusiasm for science. The present study is designed to provide experimental evidence with which to test the accuracy of quantum chemical calculations being carried out by others. The ultimate goal is to develop the ability to predict the speed and outcome of any chemical reaction through computer modeling.

During a fall storm in 1871, 31 Yankee whaling ships were crushed by the ice and sunk or burned near Point Belcher, Alaska.  During a previous field survey, utilizing sonar, the research team was able to locate a number of submerged features considered to be promising for future investigation.  This project will ground-truth those submerged features, continue the side scan sonar survey, incorporate a cesium magnetometer survey, and systematically document the on-shore sites containing substantial wreckage from the 19th  Century whaling fleet.  In addition, through collaborations with the Inupiat Heritage Center and the Ukpeagvik Inupiat Corporation Science Center, the research team will be making presentation and informing the local community of the research results.

The goal is to build monomeric metal reagents with electronic and steric properties that favor four-electron donation from either both filled pi orbitals of triple bonds or from one lone pair and the original pi bond of aldehydes, ketones and imines, building from the hypothesis that metal fragments can be designed to promote unprecedented bonding interactions with small molecules. Architectural variations of these metal ligand fragments will probe the requirements for promoting four-electron donation from simple ligands. Selective binding of nitriles through the pi system will be explored, based on the known analogy between four-electron donor alkyne ligands and eta-2 nitrile ligands and focusing initially on the design of a fragment that will leave one vacant site in a d4 octahedron so that four electrons will be required to conform to the eighteen electron rule. Binding alkynes will provide a preliminary screen for metal reagents, and promising metal ligand combinations will be utilized to pursue pi-bound nitrile complexes. In addition to triple bonds, other potential four-electron donor ligands include eta-2-coordinated aldehydes, ketones, imines, ketenes and ketenimines. If the metal moiety seeks four electrons from a single ligand, is it possible to bring both the pi electrons of the original double bond and a lone pair on the heteroatom of the substrate into a bonding relationship with a single metal center? This will require substantial reorganization of the aldehye, ketone, or imine geometry upon coordination, but it promises to significantly alter the reactivity of these organic functional groups. The reactivity of these metal ligand moieties may differ dramatically from the reactivity displayed by simple Lewis acid adducts of these groups.<br/><br/>With this award, the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Professor Maurice S. Brookhart, of the Department of Chemistry at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Professor Brookhart and his students are studying ways to design specific interactions between chosen organic molecules and metal centers that may effect catalytic transformations of these bound organic molecules. In addition to providing fundamental information about the nature of metal-organic bonding, these studies offer promise for the development of efficient methods for the catalytic conversion of organic molecules into more complex or value-added products.

PolarGrid consist of an intermittently disconnected field and base grids feeding information to lower 48 data and computing resources. True real-time processing at the field camp is backed up with increasing fidelity, but increasing delay at the base and lower 48 systems. The requested system includes an expedition grid consisting of ruggedized laptops in a field grid to a low power multi-core based camp cluster. A prototype and two production grids feed into a Teraflops system at Indiana and Elizabeth City State Universities. PolarGrid will be integrated with TeraGrid for both resource utilization and curricula sharing. Modern open data access standards will be followed so that raw processes, and simulated data can be archived outside PolarGrid by and for the science and engineering community. The innovative architecture of PolarGrid with intermittently disconnected components also has applications to other power- and bandwidth-challenged applications. The instrument responds to the recent polar satellite observations that show disintegration of ice shelves in Antarctica and the speed-up of several glaciers in Greenland.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: The infrastructure addresses an important current problem that touches all beings in one way or another, the key issue of polar ice disintegration. Strong educational activities are involved, mainly through the training of students. ECSU, a historically black university, involves undergraduate students through new curricula and research experiences.

These effects are nonlinear and thus are difficult to capture. This project will focus on how mesoscale eddies interact with the large scale and in particular what the effect of randomness and transience of the eddy field is on the mean flow. The central problem that will be tackled is how large scale currents are generated by these interactions. In the ocean, this process is ubiquitous. <br/><br/>In this project, a scientist from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution will treat these eddy effects as stochastic processes. The primary objective of this proposal is to gain a physical understanding of the mechanics behind the response of these stochastic forcings. In particular, this will allow him to consider up gradient fluxes which can not be handled by eddy viscosities, which are commonly used in circulation models. This novel approach carries an element of risk that it will not be successful.<br/><br/>The study potentially has very important broader impacts because it will provide a physical basis for a new means of parameterizing turbulence in ocean circulation models and thus climate models which should improve their performance.

However, little is known about using this data effectively and efficiently within their decision-making processes, which can often be modeled as multi-stage stochastic optimization problems. In many application domains, such as supply chain management and revenue management, these give rise to complex problems, where the decision in each stage must be made under uncertainty about the future evolution of an underlying stochastic process. Traditional approaches to these problems assume that the uncertainty is defined through explicitly specified probability distributions that are known a priori; the knowledge of these distributions is crucial to the development of the corresponding optimization algorithms. However, in most practical situations the exact distributions are not known, and only historical data is available. This research project aims to develop a general-purpose sampling-based algorithmic framework for these models that, unlike traditional approaches, uses the raw historical data as the source of samples. First, we plan to develop sampling-based algorithmic approaches to approximately solve complex stochastic dynamic programming formulations, the dominant paradigm used for these problems. Second, we focus on sampling-based algorithms for models that combine optimization and learning simultaneously. A common theme between these two research thrusts, and a central feature of our research project, is the development of explicit quantitative analysis of the performance of our algorithms that provide guarantees on the sample-size needed to assure a specified error bound with respect to optimal solution for the true underlying probability distribution.<br/><br/>Consider a firm like Amazon that provides millions of different items to customers throughout the US. Clearly, it is important for the company to have the inventory that its customers want, since if an item is out of stock, then the customer is likely to purchase the item from elsewhere. On the other hand, maintaining extra inventory for undesired items has the disadvantage of tying up capital in obtaining them, using significant resources in warehousing this supply, which is further compounded by the risk of perishability and obsolesce. If one had a crystal ball with which one could predict the future, then the company could know how many requests there will be, day by day, for each of the items it sells, and therefore know how much of what should be on hand in each of its warehouses. Instead, one can model the future probabilistically (similar to what a weather forecaster does when saying that there is a 40% chance of showers tomorrow), and then one can cast the problem of making the optimal decisions for these inventory levels as a problem of maximizing the average profit that can be obtained (or minimizing the average costs incurred), where the notion of average is with respect to the randomness used to model our inability to exactly predict the future. This project has the goal of using past historical data as a means for modeling the predictions for future data, and then designing algorithms that produce provably near-optimal decisions based on this approximation. This type of decision-making in the face of uncertainty arises in a wide range of application domains, from selling different classes of airline<br/>tickets for a portfolio of flight legs to manufacturing a suite of products that rely on overlapping sets of components. This project focuses on settings in which there are multiple stages of decision-making that must be made in the face of an evolving view of the predictions of future<br/>requirements. The aim is to provide tools to automate such decision-making with algorithms that are guaranteed to quickly produce reliable solutions.

The proposed approach combines ideas from social network analysis, Internet computing, distributed computing, and machine learning to solve problems in population biology. The diverse computational tasks of this project include design of algorithmic techniques to identify social entities such as a communities, leaders, and followers, and to use these structures to predict social response patterns to danger or disturbances. Nowhere is the impact of social structure likely to be greater than when species come in<br/>contact with predators. Thus, the accuracy and predictive power of the proposed computational tools will be tested by characterizing the social structure of horses and zebras (equids) both before and after human- or predator-induced perturbations to the social network. The proposed interdisciplinary research will have broader impacts on a wide range of research communities. New methods for analysis of social interactions in animal populations will be useful for behavioral biologists in such diverse fields as behavioral ecology, animal husbandry, conservation biology, and disease ecology. The machine learning algorithms that will be develop are relevant to many studies in which researchers need to classify temporal interaction data. The proposed network methods have broader relevance to human societies: disease transmission, dissemination<br/>of ideas, and social response to crises are all dynamic processes occurring via social networks. Further, through teaching and participation in outreach, students and school teachers will gain access to opportunities for hands-on, interdisciplinary experiences in a new area of computational biology. The research and software resulting from the proposed project will be disseminated both in computational and biological communities and enhanced by cross-disciplinary training activities and will serve to train a new generation of interdisciplinary scientists.

The proposed research employs novel epitaxial film growth/fabrication techniques for high quantum efficiency GaN-based microcavity light emitting diodes and electrically injected vertical cavity surface emitting lasers in the violet-green spectral region. Short wavelength GaN-based vertical cavity lasers will very likely provide the foundation for high-density optical data storage and high-speed optical communication, and lighting. The incoherent microcavity emitters also surpass their conventional counterparts due to their directionality, spectral purity, and increased photon extraction efficiency, making them ideal for solid-state lighting with high color rendering index and displays. Both in situ and ex situ epitaxial lateral overgrowth techniques will be used to reduce defect densities in the GaN material. Vertical cavity structures will be fabricated on the nearly defect-free wing regions of the laterally overgrown GaN to avoid nonradiative centers caused by extended and point defects. A unique epitaxial lateral overgrowth technique will allow the bottom metal and/or dielectric reflector stacks, to be used also as the growth masks. By introducing a second lateral overgrowth step, the current conduction will be allowed only through the defect-free active region of the device, promoting efficient hole injection.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/>The proposed research can potentially produce high brightness light sources for general lighting with energy savings and reduced carbon footprint, displays, and vertical lasers for optical storage/networks. Because, the demand for optical storage is growing, development of densely integrated blue vertical cavity lasers can meet the need for faster read-out and writing. Considering the novelty of the proposed device structures intense industrial collaborations are anticipated. This proposal will provide the students and interns with opportunities for cross-disciplinary learning, interactions with international scientists in the group and elsewhere, development of industrial networking, and for realization of the impact of new technologies on the marketplace and environment.

The current project is focused on refining, expanding, and testing these education innovations on a wider audience of faculty and students across the United States. It is also implementing the new materials, and in the process, creating diverse and portable modules for student projects and undergraduate research. More precisely, the project is developing faculty expertise by conducting workshops at the PI home institutions and at national meetings to train faculty to teach the course at their home institutions. Also, the PIs are recruiting participants from these workshops to develop project modules to be used by students as end of term projects or in undergraduate research. Moreover, the PIs are institutionalizing the course at their schools and are providing assistance to other interested institutions. The PIs are managing the development of a growing and self-sustaining network of faculty educators who teach and institutionalize the course, develop modules, and participate in the assessment of the role of the course in the curriculum.

In this research, the PI will develop a new assistive technology to enable individuals who are severely paralyzed to convey their intentions to their environment by accessing a portable computer or personal digital assistant. The PI's approach is based on the observation that the tongue and mouth occupy an amount of sensory and motor cortex in the human brain rivaling that of the fingers and the hand. As a consequence, the tongue and mouth are inherently capable of sophisticated motor control and manipulation tasks with many degrees of freedom. The tongue is connected to the brain via the hypoglossal nerve, which generally escapes severe damage in spinal cord injuries. Tongue muscle is similar to heart muscle, in that it does not fatigue easily. Furthermore, the tongue is not influenced by the position of the rest of the body, which can be adjusted for maximum user comfort. These advantages, coupled with the accessibility of tongue movements without penetrating the skin, suggest that the tongue might be employed as an excellent intermediate connection to the brain to establish a noninvasive brain-computer interface. The PI will explore this possibility in the current project within the context of a new device called the Tongue Drive System (TDS). TDS consists of an array of magnetic sensors located either inside the mouth (e.g., attached to the outer surfaces of the teeth via an orthodontic brace) or outside of it near the user's cheeks (e.g., mounted on a headset similar to head-worn microphones). The sensor array measures the magnetic field of a small permanent magnetic tracer, the size of a grain of rice, which is attached to the tongue by means of tissue adhesives, implantation, piercing, or clipping. Sensor signals are transmitted wirelessly to the external PC/PDA, where the data are processed to determine in real time the coordinates, orientation, and relative motion of the magnet with respect to the array of sensors. This information is then used to control the movements of a cursor on the PC/PDA screen and to perform all other functions that an able-bodied individual can do with a mouse computer input device. The PC/PDA will have WiFi or Bluetooth connections to a number of other devices, including a desktop computer and powered wheelchair, in the user's environment.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: This research will help the most severely disabled individuals, particularly<br/>quadriplegics, to lead more active, self-supportive, satisfying, and productive lives. Paralysis is considered to be one of the most expensive types of disabilities. Solutions such as the TDS will help reduce healthcare and assisted-living costs, increase the employability of people with disabilities, and allow users to participate more fully in society while relieving the burden on family members and caregivers.

With funding from this grant, scientists at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution will participate in a pair of GEOTRACES intercalibration cruises in 2008 and 2009. They will focus their efforts on understanding the physical and chemical principles governing the spatial and temporal distributions of radioisotopes in the natural Uranium-Thorium decay series. U-Th tracers are likely to be vital to the interpretation of key GEOTRACES trace elements that are particle- reactive and bioactive. Essentially, thorium isotopes will provide direct information on the vertical fluxes and remineralization rates on time scales of days/weeks (234Th t Ω = 24.1 d) up to several years (228Th t Ω = 1.91 yr), while 228Ra (t Ω = 5.75 y) is a tracer of horizontal transport from basin margins to the interior on time scales of months to years. The investigators contend that these effects, i.e. surface scavenging and remineralization as well as horizontal transport of suspended particles far from ocean boundaries, are important in setting the distributions of many trace elements that will be measured in GEOTRACES, and important for understanding oceanic processes in their own right. <br/><br/>Specifically, the Woods Hole group will: 1) participate with other GEOTRACES scientists in the general particulate trace element intercalibration efforts comparing in-situ vs. bottle vs. deck based sampling methods and making basic filter and operational comparisons appropriate for a wider suite of particle reactive trace elements for distribution to the scientific community; 2) organize and lead distribution of particulate 234Th and 238Th for intercalibration among that community; and 3) work on a novel set of sampling and analytical methods to improve accuracy and reduce water requirements for this suite of Th and Ra isotopes. <br/><br/>In terms of broader impacts, it is clear that this effort will benefit oceanographic research activites well beyond GEOTRACES inasmuch as new practical and theoretical knowledge about sampling and analytical methodologies will be obtained. The project will also involve significant inter-institutional collaboration, both within the US and internationally, as marine radiochemists around the world will have the opportunity to participate in analytical intercalibration activities.

However, we know very little about how organisms respond to multiple stressors, or the cumulative effects of stress. At present, the most effective means of measuring stress on many wild animals, especially endangered birds, are hormone levels, especially those associated with stress or physiological state, in fecal samples, which provide a ready means of assessing stress in species. However, the validity of this technique still needs to be verified for many species and for many hormones. This project will conduct experiments needed to establish the validity of the fecal hormone measures used to quantify these pressures in Northern Spotted Owls, their response to stress, which could be psychological, nutritional, and/or reproductive stress. With present methods for extracting hormones, small fecal samples appear to have higher hormone concentrations than larger samples. This is likely due to a higher extraction efficiency for these small samples. This study will develop methods for hormone extraction for all fecal hormones that will be equally efficient, independent of sample size and validate the fecal thyroid hormone measure for use in northern spotted owls, as well as other species. <br/><br/>This study will be among the first of its kind to use non-invasive hormone measures to examine impacts facing wildlife, and will address a major technical problem that will have impacts for all studies on wild animals where fecal hormones are used. This project includes extensive outreach, and training of interns of diverse backgrounds in research methods and federal policy. The project provides post-doctoral training for one woman and half time graduate student support. This work is important for the protection and habitat management for the Northern Spotted Owl, a federally protected species. The study will also engage the local off-highway vehicle clubs, and enlist them directly in the project as collaborators, increasing their understanding of, and likely compliance with, mitigation efforts. This study effectively involves cooperation of researchers, wildlife managers, and affected user groups.

The work involves algorithmic development, large scale computation, and the use of computation as a discovery tool. The main focuses of the research include:<br/><br/>(i) Focus on demonstrating that the colossal magnetoresistance effect occurs in realistic microscopic materials of the double-exchange family. The PIs aim to include in Monte Carlo simulations all the ingredients believed to be important to explain this phenomenon, the Hund coupling, phonons, superexchange, and quenched disorder.<br/><br/>(ii) There is experimental evidence that an electronic reconstruction occurs at the interface of certain materials, particularly the transition metal oxides. These effects suggest that analogs of semiconducting heterostructures can be developed using complex oxides. The PIs will explore a variety of interfaces including manganite-manganite, superconductor-manganite, and manganite-titanate. The properties of these artificially prepared systems will be studied. <br/><br/>(iii) The PIs will investigate a real space model for diluted magnetic semiconductors that reproduces the valance bands of the parent compound, takes into account random manganese doping and spin-orbit interaction, and can be studied with unbiased numerical techniques. Results will be meaningfully compared with experiments for a variety of compounds.<br/><br/>(iv) The PIs will use the time dependent density matrix renormalization group technique to study transport in models for molecules, polymers, transformation of a Mott insulator into a metal, and the sudden expansion of a fermionic gas.<br/><br/>This award supports the training of graduate students in advanced computational methods for condensed matter theory and materials research. The research activity involves international collaboration with researchers in Latin America.<br/><br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/>This award supports computational and theoretical research and education on complex materials that exhibit unusual electronic properties and new states of matter which are a consequence of strong interactions among electrons. Using theoretical concepts and advanced computation, the PIs aim to gain insight into new states of matter, effects where small magnetic fields can lead to dramatic changes in the resistance to the flow of electric current, and how charge moves through molecules. They also hope to discover novel magnetic phenomena in semiconductors and semiconductor heterostructures, and more. All these lay the foundations for future technological applications that have the potential to revolutionize electronics and our understanding of certain classes of materials. This activity helps to keep America competitive in the 21st century, not only through intellectual advances but through education of the next generation of scientists able to use computation as a discovery tool and able to function competitively in a global economy.

Together, these three forms of <br/>accountability ensure that any host, router, and autonomous network <br/>can identify misbehaving components.<br/><br/>Operationally, this results in: an Internet in which any spoofing or <br/>forgery of source addresses is detectable (from source <br/>accountability); a partial defense against flooding attacks from <br/>compromised hosts (also from source accountability); an Internet <br/>where route hijacking and other security compromises to inter-domain <br/>routing are impossible (from control-plane accountability); and the <br/>ability for end hosts and operators to pinpoint locations where <br/>packets are being lost or excessively delayed even when the problems <br/>are in other networks (from data-plane accountability).<br/><br/>The cornerstone of AIP is its use of a self-certifying address <br/>format. All AIP addresses are of the form AD:EID, where AD is the <br/>identifier for the autonomous domain that the host belongs to, and <br/>EID is a globally unique host identifier. Both address components are <br/>derived from public keys held by the domain and host, respectively, <br/>allowing other entities to verify the authenticity and provenance of <br/>packets and messages. AIP's self-certifying addressing allows simple <br/>protocols to realize the above benefits.
0732217	A Longitudinal Examination of Children's Developing Knowledge of Measurement: Mathematical and Scientific Concept and Strategy Growth from Pre-K through Grade 5	DRL	REAL, DR-K12 APPLIED RESEARCH	08/15/2007	07/27/2010	Jeffrey Barrett	IL	Illinois State University	Continuing grant	Janice M. Earle	07/31/2012	$1,594,532.00	Douglas Clements	jbarrett@ilstu.edu	100 S Fell Ave	Normal	IL	617901000	3094382528	EHR	7625, 7646	9177, SMET	$0.00	The project proposes a longitudinal study that investigates the development of an understanding of measurement across 7 grades-from pre-K through Grade 5.  Specifically, the project will establish clear cognitive accounts of the development of students' strategic and conceptual knowledge of measurement on increasingly demanding sets of length, perimeter, and area measurement tasks.  The research questions are:<br/>How do students develop coherent knowledge and integrated strategies for measurement across the developmental span from pre-K though Grade 5?<br/>How are students' developing cognitive abilities for perceptual and numerical comparison, for coordinating and discriminating, for deductive logic, and for ordering and nesting sequences related to the development of knowledge and strategies for measurement?<br/>How are students' developing abilities for spatial thinking, algebraic reasoning, or proportional reasoning related to their measurement knowledge and strategies?<br/>How might students' developing representational fluency for measurement relate to their mathematical and scientific understanding of measurement?<br/>How is the development of students' developing knowledge of measurement (especially their use of rulers and other tools, with accuracy and precision) related to the development of their scientific modeling and reasoning across varying contexts?<br/><br/>Two longitudinal studies will be conducted at two different sites:  a New York site will address the early development of children's understanding and strategies, while an Illinois site will focus on later elementary level development.  The researchers propose design cycles with clinical interviews, written interviews, and classroom teaching experiments.  <br/>

Episodes from the collection will be made accessible worldwide to provide an invaluable and unique asset to the field that can be used in creative and effective ways by researchers and providers of in-service and pre-service teacher education through the Internet. Analyzed digital video clips, transcriptions and images of students' work will be linked with analytical commentaries, produced and referenced according to the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) Process Standards for reasoning and justification. Video episodes and supporting materials will be organized into a database and placed on a server for Internet access. In order to make the database contents easily accessible, an indexing scheme made up of attributes or descriptors will be developed and applied, guided by the expertise of a distinguished Advisory Board. The database will be accessible for use by classroom teachers, researchers and teacher educators. The resulting database will enable teachers to study in detail the learning of individual students in classroom settings and in small group work and through individual interviews. A very important aspect of the video data is that it enables one to study how learning actually unfolds. These video tools will make it possible for teachers, teacher educators, and researchers to closely observe students' learning of mathematics and reflect on students' potential for doing mathematics. The collection of video data provides a database for careful analysis and reflection on practice.

The prohibitive cost of large optical buffers has lead to many optical network designs with small buffers on routers. A major challenge in this context is to envision efficient operation scenarios that justify these small buffer networks. This project aims at developing an architecture that implements packet spacing on network links such that suitable statistical properties of network traffic can be ensured and small-buffer networks can be operated efficiently. The specific goals of this project are: (1) understanding of packet spacing and its network-wide impact, (2) development of a pacing node prototype, and (3) consideration of network-wide deployment. The packet spacing architecture developed in this project can help in promoting the broad deployment of optical packet switching technology.<br/>Intellectual Merit: The intellectual merit of this project includes three aspects. First, the research will further our understanding of the impact of packet spacing on the whole network (rather than being limited to a single buffer analysis). Second, the pacing architecture will help improve the efficiency of operation of optical core networks and thus improve the Internet as a whole. Third, the cross-disciplinary research covering queuing analysis, network measurements, system design, and prototype implementation and deployment sets up an agenda to address real-world network issues.<br/>Broader Impact: Guarantees on traffic statistics that a packet pacing architecture can provide are an essential step in the process to convince the Internet community, especially Internet service providers, to adopt and deploy optical networks. A wide-spread adoption of such networks in the U.S. could increase the availability of high-bandwidth data communication and improve wide-spread access to modern communication services and applications.

However, many unanswered questions concerning their solution and solid-state structures remain. Specific aim 1 of this proposal is designed to enhance our understanding of the aggregation state, the coordination number, the geometry of attached ligands, and the intimate structural features of such reagents. Results of this project will provide models for use in developing new reagents and in optimizing the stereoselectivity of extant reagents. <br/><br/>The second specific aim of this project is designed to synthesize and characterize new reagents and to develop asymmetric synthetic methodology utilizing new chiral polymeric reagents that will be prepared in my lab. The design of new polymers will be based upon structure motifs of reactive intermediates from my lab. <br/><br/>New equipment will be designed and protocols developed from growing, sorting and manipulating extremely reactive, extremely moisture sensitive and extremely temperature sensitive organometallic compounds in preparation for their characterization by x-ray diffraction analysis. Hence, a high throughput crystal screening apparatus and protocol will be developed in analogy to the protocols that have proven highly successful for high throughput preparation of macromolecular protein crystals.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: Stereoselectivity is the basis for synthesizing pure, chiral chemical compounds. Structural details are especially important for the optimization of stereoselectivity in the design of new reagents and catalysts. Speculative and unproven structural postulates typically have been utilized for this purpose. However knowledge of the intimate structure of these reagents remains woefully incomplete and is not commensurate with the widespread, successful use of these reagents in practice. Nonetheless it is encouraging that there is a very good correlation between the structures of these reagents and their reactivity. <br/><br/>Hence, I propose a research program designed to obtain structural information that will be utilized to prepare new chiral polymers and to improve the efficiency with which new chemical compounds are prepared. Specific to this proposal is a focus on boron enolate reagents and chiral lithium amide bases. New reagents that we develop will be optimized for the synthesis of chiral molecules utilized as catalysts and as building blocks for larger molecules. Success of this project directly and positively affects the efficiency with which new materials, nanostructures, polymers, and bulk organic chemicals are discovered and prepared. <br/><br/>All students in my research group develop expertise in organic synthesis, spectroscopic analyses, chromatography and x-ray diffraction analysis with a major emphasis on acquiring the skills necessary to continue independent research in a chemical, materials or biochemical research laboratory. I actively recruit students to participate in this program in collaboration with ongoing initiatives at Brown University including the Leadership Alliance (minority undergraduates), NSF COACH grant (graduate women in science), UTRA (undergraduate teaching and research), WISE (undergraduate women in science & engineering) and Beckman Foundation (undergraduate research training) programs. I am especially pleased with success we have had in the inclusion of minority, female undergraduates identified through the Leadership Alliance and WISE programs.

However, some important estuarine chemical fluxes and processes amongst them the flux of material from shelf bottom waters up into brackish surface waters and the flux of regenerated material off-shelf in bottom waters remain poorly understood. <br/><br/>Scientists from the University of Southern Mississippi, the University of South Alabama, and the University of South Florida would determine the distributions of nutrients, trace elements, radium isotopes and other tracers in the outflow of the Mississippi River (1) to constrain water, nutrient and trace element fluxes; (2) to compare chemical distributions in different distributary mixing zones of an estuarine system to see how physiographic differences affect chemical fluxes; (3) to examine physical-chemical speciation of trace elements in a river plume/estuary mixing zone to see how sources and sinks of the trace elements are reflected in the speciation; and (4) to further develop and apply radium tracer methodology to these problems. Results of the field work would be incorporated into mass balance models of the Mississippi River outflow system to provide a more quantitative and systematic estimate of material fluxes. <br/><br/>As regards broader impacts, this study would further our understanding of transport and cycling of nutrients and trace elements in river-dominated coastal systems. Understanding the fluxes of these elements in coastal and estuarine systems would allow for the development of management models and scenarios to predict the effect of management policies on the chemical and biological health of the coastal zone. This study would help foster new inter-institutional collaborations with two new investigators. Two graduate students from the University of Southern Mississippi, one graduate student from the University of South Alabama, and one graduate student and two undergraduate students from the University of South Florida would be supported and trained as part of this project.

Through systematic experimentation with humans and virtual (computer-based) humans, this project seeks to deepen understanding of the factors underlying rapport by looking more closely at the synchronization (i.e., process entrainment). The research will employ emotionally expressive virtual humans that are responsive to human participants' (i) respiratory patterns, (ii) facial feature and gaze tracking, and (iii) optical flow. If unilateral entrainment (of humans to virtual humans) produces rapport-like social consequences, it would greatly simplify interface agent design, obviating the need for sophisticated sensing and generation of matching behavior. Alternatively, it may promote certain undesirable social attributions -- incompetence, resentment, and dislike -- that could conflict with the goals of the application. This project investigates this fundamental question for human-computer interaction and virtual agent design. <br/><br/>This technology has the potential to facilitate the establishment of rapport between humans and virtual humans and to achieve the broader range of socially desirable consequences including improved computer-mediated learning and health interventions. As rapport is a key social moderator found to influence outcomes in a variety of settings that require teaching or persuasion, this research could inform the development of virtual training in the areas of negotiation, conflict resolution and cultural awareness. Finally, this project has broad dissemination potential given that rapport is inherently interdisciplinary, involving the domains of social psychology, business, communication and computer science.

In particular, star formation is perhaps the worst understood and least developed ingredients of modern cosmological simulations. This collaborative project, led by Dr Kravtsov, aims to reduce greatly the uncertainty in the physics of galaxy formation by developing new, observationally motivated models for the formation of stars and star clusters. Recent advances in numerical algorithms and computing power mean that cosmological hydrodynamical simulations can now resolve the actual sites of star formation in the interstellar medium, making it possible to track the formation and destruction of giant molecular clouds self-consistently. The planned suite of ultra high-resolution N-body and gas dynamic adaptive mesh refinement simulations will incorporate an unprecedented wealth of physical processes, including the formation of molecular hydrogen on dust and its self-shielding from ambient ultraviolet radiation, and self-consistent three-dimensional continuum radiative transfer. On smaller unresolved scales, the simulations will incorporate star formation recipes based on reliable empirical correlations. The planned research will study the molecular content of high-redshift galaxies, develop star formation prescriptions consistent with the observational correlations, and study star formation in different galactic environments. It will address the formation and evolution of massive star clusters, for which abundant observational data exist, and investigate the dependence of cluster formation efficiency on properties of the host galaxy.<br/><br/>This project is unique in its ability to bridge the large scales of galaxy formation and the small scales of star formation, thus developing links between those two research communities. By involving students, the work provides professional training of young computational cosmologists in cutting-edge simulation techniques. The results provide support for current and forthcoming space- and ground-based observing programs. The research results are tightly integrated into academic teaching, and public education and outreach activities. Three-dimensional visualizations of the simulations will be available for planetarium shows and public lectures, and also web-accessible.

Cross-layer design is strongly needed for such a network due to its two special features; dynamic spectrum availability and spectrum heterogeneity. Quite different from other well-studied wireless networks, such as mobile ad hoc networks and wireless sensor networks, the major concerns of WMNs are throughput, fairness, and QoS support, instead of mobility support and power efficiency.<br/><br/>The PIs plan to conduct a comprehensive study on cross-layer optimization in DSA WMNs, and design protocols under the guidance of this cross-layer optimization. They will concentrate on the bottom four layers of the network stack and seek joint congestion control, routing, spectrum sharing, and power control solutions with the objective of maximizing throughput, achieving certain fairness, and providing QoS support. Furthermore, the research will be conducted under various network models including different interference models, different traffic models, and different fairness models.<br/><br/>The INTELLECTUAL MERIT of the project includes (1) a unified mathematical model which precisely characterizes all important features and the formal formulations of the cross-layer optimization problems under different network models, (2) centralized and distributed algorithms for solving the optimization problems, and (3) a spectrum-aware routing protocol.<br/><br/>The BROADER IMPACT of the project includes (1) novel cross-layer schemes for emerging DSA WMNs, with impact on the advancement of information technology, (2) high quality publications and training of highly skilled students, and (3) possible impact on the standardization in IETF and IEEE for DSA wireless networks in the future.

Currently, ESF cannot be predicted on a day-to-day basis, even up to less than an hour before the expected first appearance of ESF. There is growing evidence that a key, though unheralded, player may be large-scale wave structure (LSWS) that develops in the bottomside F layer, whereas many previous efforts focused on the post-sunset rise of the F region at dusk. Recent research suggests that measurements of the velocity of the post-sunset rise may be contaminated by the large-scale wave structure, which may help explain why the control of ESF by the post-sunset rise, which holds climatologically, breaks down on a day-to-day basis. This project will investigate the relationships among the large scale wave structure, the post sunset rise, and ESF. The detection and characterization of the large scale wave structures require use of a radar with a steerable beam or sensors spaced closely in longitude. Currently, the only sensors of this kind are the multi-beam radars on the island of Pohnpei and Christmas Island as well as the steerable incoherent-scatter radar ALTAIR located in Kwajalein. The project will use the datasets to perform the following tasks: (1) Use three-beam radar data collected over seven years at Pohnpei, and two-beam radar data collected over four years at Christmas Island, to determine the presence of large scale wave structure and to extract the true post-sunset rise velocity; (2) Operate the recently reconfigured five-beam radar at Pohnpei in order to acquire data which will enable determination of the horizontal wavelength of the large scale wave structure; (3 ) Use all data collected by both radars, each spanning a full solar cycle, to determine short-term and long-term relationships among large scale wave structure, the post-sunset rise, and ESF. The proposed effort is expected to yield the first database with information on large scale waves structure, the post sunset rise, and ESF containing continuous measurements from two locations in the central Pacific sector that span a single, full solar cycle This database can be used for various investigations on time scales from a minute to a full single solar cycle and will be suitable for support of satellite programs such as CHAMP, ROCSAT, DMSP, TIMED, Formosat, and C/NOFS.

For at least the past few million years a convincing case can be made that the cycles are often controlled by the periodic variations in Earth's orbit and rotation as well as interactions with nearby planets that produce climate variations every 20, 40, 100, and 400 ky. However in more ancient rocks the problem is much more difficult because of a lack of independent age control which leads to a-priori corrections for apparent changes in sediment accumulation rates prior to testing the orbital forcing hypothesis. Recurrent evidence for incompleteness of cyclical records exacerbates the problem, because any strata missing within orbital timescales cannot be detected by existing pre-Neogene chronologies. If one could document that these cycles occur in rocks that are 50 million years old, for example, it would allow geoscientists to tell time in rocks for the past 50 million years at unprecedented levels of precision by matching models for Solar System dynamics with cycles in rocks. <br/><br/>We propose a program, of high-resolution U-Pb zircon geochronology to resolve the orbital forcing debate for one of the classic examples of cyclic sediments, the Early Eocene Green River Formation. These spectacularly preserved rocks were deposited in a large lake ca. 50 million years ago. The goal of the proposed work is to quantitatively test, at high precision, the hypothesis that the cyclicity in the Green River Fm. is orbitally forced, where the forcing is achieved through changes in Earth's climate that are paced by the periodic changes in the Earth's orbit. We propose to use U-Pb zircon geochronology from abundant interlayered ash beds to provide at least one age per ~100 ky interval with expected precision of less than plus or minus 50 ky. <br/><br/>In addition and partially related to the debate about the origin of sediment cyclicity, this research will also test climate's role in the stratigraphic architecture of lacustrine strata. The Early Eocene Climate Optimum is the warmest interval preceding the prolonged cooling that culminated in the current glaciated climate, and thus finding reliable, highly resolved climate records is especially relevant in view of future warmer conditions predicted with anthropogenic increases in pCO2. A highly resolved Early Eocene climate history will have far reaching implications for understanding the effect of climate on mammalian evolution and allow detailed evaluation of the robustness of dynamical models for the Solar System to ca. 50 Ma. <br/><br/>The proposed research is an outcome of EARTHTIME (www.earth-time.org), an initiative to bring together a broad cross-section of geochronologists, paleontologists, and stratigraphers with the goal of sequencing Earth history at a much-improved level of resolution. The proposed research will provide a new approach to calibrating the Early Eocene part of the time-scale and will allow for detailed cross-calibration between 40Ar/39Ar and U-Pb chronometers.

The research will include plasma treatment of dental surfaces without acid etching or demineralization in order to successfully replace the currently used drilling and acid etching procedures. The studies will also include micro- and nanoindentation in order to determine the mechanical properties of the interface regions as well as further study of the plasma-induced elimination of bacteria that will sustain the interface for a longer time after restoration. <br/><br/>This project seeks solutions to existing dental problems by applying novel plasma surface/interface engineering principles. This project will have high impact for the dental treatment field. The knowledge gained will be valuable in solving many other biomedical problems. The interdisciplinary collaboration in the project provides a larger audience for research dissemination. Outreach and education activities will be: (1) to introduce students to the basic scope and frontiers of engineering and biomedical research, (2) to involve underrepresented groups in engineering and science; and (3) to promote public awareness and recognition of the importance of applying engineering principles to solve biomedical problems.

With regard to infinite<br/>dimensional stochastic equations and statistical hydrodynamics,<br/>the investigator focuses on three questions. The first concerns<br/>the structure of typical solutions for nonlinear stochastic<br/>partial differential equations such as the two-dimensional<br/>stochastic Navier-Stokes equations and the stochastic Burgers<br/>equation. The second concerns the uniqueness of steady states for<br/>inviscid randomly forced equations on unbounded domains. The<br/>third concerns the mechanism of energy transfer from high to low<br/>modes in stochastically forced formally conservative systems. For<br/>each of these questions new analytic approaches and new phenomena<br/>have been described. A goal of this work is to more completely<br/>analyze these phenomena. In combinatorics, growth models, and<br/>random matrix theory the investigator studies basic questions of<br/>Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE) random matrix theory, focusing<br/>on the connection of symmetrized combinatorial models to limiting<br/>distributions of the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble. The questions<br/>considered include problems of random tiling that arise in<br/>physics, polynuclear growth models that arise in the study of<br/>random interfaces, and percolation models that arise in condensed<br/>matter physics and electrical engineering. A goal of the work is<br/>to prove new central limit theorems in the context of GOE random<br/>matrix theory. <br/><br/> Understanding the small-scale structure of stochastically<br/>forced hydrodynamic equations is related to turbulence theory and<br/>statistical mechanics. The small-scale structure of solutions is<br/>of both theoretical and experimental importance. It is this<br/>structure that matters in turbulent flows arising in many concrete<br/>problems of aerodynamics and fluid mechanics. The particular<br/>questiuons studied here contribute to the current understanding of<br/>this small-scale structure. It has recently become clear that<br/>random matrix theory techniques answer a wide range of questions<br/>in a variety of seemingly unrelated fields. Essentially, random<br/>matrix theory affords a model that captures the fluctuations of<br/>many distinct processes. The questions studied in this project<br/>widen this class of problems and processes and improve the current<br/>understanding of the various phenomena that lead to random matrix<br/>statistics.

It is<br/>usually necessary to reprogram sensor nodes after they are deployed<br/>through wireless links. This project is aimed at investigating secure,<br/>robust, and DoS-resilient remote programming of sensor nodes through<br/>wireless links. First, this project develops a novel reliability<br/>mechanism that integrates proactive transmission and NACK mechanisms<br/>to tolerate packet losses during code dissemination efficiently.<br/>Second, this research integrates efficient authentication mechanisms<br/>into this approach to guarantee the integrity of disseminated code<br/>images. Third, this project develops weak authentication mechanisms<br/>to mitigate the potential DoS attacks aimed at consuming the resources<br/>(particularly the battery power) of sensor nodes. Fourth, this project<br/>extends the above techniques to provide secure, proactively robust,<br/>and DoS-resilient code dissemination in hybrid sensor networks, where<br/>there are both high-end nodes (e.g., PDAs, Intel mote 2) connected<br/>through high-capacity wireless links (e.g., 802.11) and low-end nodes<br/>(e.g., MicaZ motes) connected via low-power wireless links (e.g.,<br/>802.15.4). To achieve a thorough understanding of these techniques,<br/>this project implements all the proposed techniques and evaluates them<br/>in a hybrid wireless sensor network test-bed named WiSeNeT at North<br/>Carolina State University.

In urban cities, the vast majority of children entering preschool/elementary school and high school are Latino, Asian or African American, and how well these children and their families adjust to these high-stake school transitions will have long term implications for children's developmental outcomes as well as the future of the U.S. In the context of growing diversity among the nation's children, systematic inquiry into the experiences and developmental pathways of children from different cultural communities during periods of major transitions is urgently needed. <br/><br/>In response, the NYU IRADS builds on 5 years of research under NYU's Center for Research on Culture, Development and Education (CRCDE), and seeks to advance scientific theory and knowledge on children's social, emotional and cognitive development in ethnically diverse populations. Plans are to follow a group of 900 urban, predominantly low-income and working class families of Mexican, Dominican, Chinese, European and African American decent with young children (4-7 years) and adolescents (13-17 years) as children enter preschool/elementary school and high school. The majority of these families have participated in the research of the CRCDE over the past several years, and have already provided rich information on the background experiences of these children and families beginning at children's birth (in the early childhood group) and entry into middle school (in the adolescent group). The five ethnic groups were selected for study, as they comprise the majority of children in New York City. In addition, they enable contrasts among groups with different immigration statuses, histories of discrimination related to race and skin color, citizenship status, and language and cultural backgrounds. <br/><br/>The planned activities involve continued gathering of original data on aspects of children's cognitive, social, and emotional development and experiences in home and school settings that would be most sensitive to children's experiences across critical transitions. Within the area of social development, focus will be on social competence and social identity. For cognitive development, focus will be on language/literacy, math concepts and performance, classification skills, attention abilities, and academic performance and engagement. For emotional development, focus will be on children's emotion regulation. Together, these skills form the building blocks for healthy developmental outcomes. In home and school settings, focus will be on the beliefs and practices of parents, teachers and children; the quality of relationships (e.g., parent-child, teacher child); and financial resources. <br/><br/>The Intellectual Merit of this research includes the generation of new, culturally grounded theory and knowledge on the development and experiences of children from diverse ethnic backgrounds across multiple developmental areas, social settings, and significant developmental transitions. The Broader Impacts are framed by a set of integrated plans to advance research and education on ethnically diverse populations through the: (1) training of a new generation of scholars (especially underrepresented minorities) to engage in research that advances the scientific mission; (2) sharing of instruments, methods, and findings so as to strengthen the scientific capacity of researchers to engage in culturally sensitive studies of children's development; (3) dissemination of findings to researchers, educators and policy makers through publications, trainings, briefings and community outreach; and (4) strengthening of local, national, and international partnerships.

The proposed lidar integrates the state-of-the-art technologies of lasers, laser spectroscopy, electro-optics, and sensors into a single system to produce a powerful and robust tool with unmatched measurement capabilities. The revolutionary lidar design and the readiness of alexandrite laser technology make the Fe Doppler lidar superb in the following ways: it will be able to obtain simultaneous measurements of temperature (30-110 km), wind (80-110 km), Fe density (75-115 km), and aerosol (10-100 km) in both day and night with high accuracy, high precision, and high spatial and temporal resolutions. The lidar is robust and compact for groundbased mobile deployment. It is containerized to move via a truck or ship to field locations of interest with extensive geographic coverage. Chirp-free and dither-free frequency locking and saturation-free Fe layer resonance results in a bias-free estimate of winds and temperatures, which is revolutionary for Doppler lidar. High energy and the UV wavelength employed by the lidar leads to a much more sensitive estimate of temperature and aerosol backscatter in stratosphere and mesosphere than determined through Na and K lidars. The 80-cm multi-telescope receiver, double-etalon filter for high rejection of solar background, and a state-of-the-art diagnostic system ensures accurate measurements in both day and night. The resulting breakthrough in lidar technology will push the atmospheric observations to a completely new level and the mobility of the system will enable new scientific endeavors. The lidar will become a community tool, available to all scientific users. Partnerships with private sector companies will result in new products with wide scientific use and commercial impact. Innovative technologies developed in this project will lead to new applications of advanced laser and remote sensing technology in the detection of biological and chemical agents, in nano-scale tube engineering, and in semi-conductor inspection. Exceptional opportunities for graduate and undergraduate education and training will arise from this project. A large number of scientists have strong interests in the instrument development, spin-off applications, and the data collected by this lidar. Many of these scientists will educate and train graduate and undergraduate students for whom this instrument and its data will be essential. Minority and under-represented students will be recruited through the Woman in Engineering Office (WIE) and Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU). This project will support the research of a female scientist (PI).

Such maternal effects are widespread, and continuing research demonstrates just how subtle and profound they can be. There is tremendous interdisciplinary interest in maternal effects because of their evolutionary implications, but several key, inter-related questions remain unanswered. Since the exciting discovery that egg yolks contain maternally derived steroid hormones researchers have been investigating the many ways by which yolk steroids can provide a mechanism for maternal effects on offspring phenotype. At this stage it seems likely that the consequences of yolk steroids for offspring are complex, may be positive or negative depending on the traits examined, and that they differ both within and among taxa. To date, however, there have been limited interactions between researchers studying this phenomenon in different taxa and it is not yet clear if large-scale patterns regarding the function of yolk steroids in offspring development occur. As part of the broader impacts of this symposium, speakers from the full spectrum of career stages (doctoral student to full professor) will be brought together to encourage collaborative opportunities that are essential to maintaining a vigorous discipline. Such interactions will encourage a more synthetic approach to the study of yolk steroids by bringing together, for the first time, researchers working on related questions in birds, reptiles, fishes, and amphibians.

The research addresses both, the theoretical foundations of automatic test generation, and practical test and coverage tools for real-time embedded systems. Many signals affecting system behavior may not be observable, or may be difficult to measure online without affecting system behavior, and the system itself may not be easily reset to an initial state to drive different tests. In this research, tasks in the system are modeled as event automata, and the joint event automaton represents the composition of event automata for all tasks in the system. The research is exploring game and control-theoretic techniques to synthesize, from an automatically constructed abstract interaction graph of the implementation, a test director. The test director introduces variable delays in the execution of the system such that a maximal number of coverage goals are met. A testing tool, DIRECT, implements directed real-time testing for embedded systems, combining static analysis (interaction graph construction), control theory (test director construction) and dynamic analysis (online system monitoring in the presence of the test director) to achieve high interaction coverage. In particular, these problems would be studied in a resource-constrained setting, where both online measurements and test director implementation must be optimized for time and space. The tools and techniques would be evaluated on two testbeds available to us: an embedded development platform on top of Lego Mindstorm robots developed by one of the PIs at UC Santa Cruz and a sensor board for marine tracking developed at UC Santa Cruz.

It includes residential summer institutes with academic year online communication for in-service teachers who are involved in professional development of their colleagues. During each summer institute, teachers will be introduced to sets of STEM Polar Connections Modules that will emphasize the process of scientific inquiry and will explore a variety of proven techniques for effective teaching, including inquiry-based teaching, cooperative learning, and methods for formative assessment of student learning. The summer institutes at UMass will be designed to advance the knowledge that STEM teachers have of the characteristics of and processes that occur in Polar Regions so that they can effectively field test curriculum modules and disseminate final versions of the modules at the local, regional, and national level. The activities of the STEM Polar Connections Modules will be aligned with the National Science Education Standards and with state standards for each state in the three participating regions. The activities will emphasize the value of advancing society's understanding of the nature and possible causes of changes in the physical environment and ecosystems of the Polar Regions and the relationship of those changes with other physical environments and ecosystems. The interdisciplinary activities of STEM Polar Connections Modules will be also designed to acquaint middle and high school students with the many avenues of polar research, the extent of international collaborations in polar research, and opportunities they will have to participate in that research. The modules will utilize several formats in order to maximize the range of middle and high school STEM programs into which the modules can effectively be integrated. Teachers will be actively engaged in the process of producing final versions of the STEM Polar Connections Modules initially drafted by the STEM Polar Connections staff. A strong educational research component will assess the effectiveness of providing local and regional contexts for conducting research that results in an understanding of Earth's global systems that are influenced by and interact with the physical environments and ecosystems of Polar Regions.

This includes applying methods from singularity theory to determine from an underlying skeletal/medial structure the local, relative and global geometric properties of a region in Euclidean space and its boundary. Second, he is developing, in joint work, a new method for finding intersection of spline surfaces for geometric modeling.

These ideas will be used for investigating statistical properties of geometrical features for shape. Second, Professor Damon will further develop methods for following the evolution of intersection curves under flows of spline surfaces and apply them to give a new method for computing the medial axis of regions with boundaries defined by splines. Third, he will apply his methods to complete, in joint research, the analysis of local features in natural images allowing shade/shadow and specularity, geometric features, and movement of either viewpoint or light source. He will further begin developing algorithms with imaging scientists for their implementation.<br/><br/>Professor Damon?s research will further investigate properties of spaces used to model objects and regions, and systems of equations which provide understanding of properties of geometric spaces and their representations. These methods will be applied to several problems in computer imaging. The first method will be used for modeling multiple objects and their interaction, including statistical properties of such collections. This method will allow for degeneracies of the structures, and these resulting models will be used for analyzing interaction of regions in medical images. These same methods will also be used for understanding the evolution of intersections of deforming objects with applications to geometric modeling. Third, he will analyze the properties of equations which can be used to model the images of objects in natural images, where lighting and viewpoint affect the appearance of geometric features of objects. These results will be used in joint work with computer scientists to develop procedures for identifying objects in images.<br/>

The discovery of these hot Jupiters defied previous experience based on the Solar System. Their detailed orbital and physical properties present several specific mysteries, which are probably<br/>clues to their origins, internal structure, and early protostellar environment. Why are their masses significantly smaller on average than those of planets with longer periods? Why do the periods peak at ~3 days? Why are their orbits less eccentric? Presuming that they formed on larger orbits and migrated inward, why did the hot Jupiters not migrate all the way into their stars, or do we see only the lucky survivors of a much larger initial population? Were hot Neptunes once hot Jupiters that suffered severe mass loss? Among the few hot Jupiters that have well-determined radii by virtue of transiting their stars, why are many of these radii significantly larger or smaller than straightforward<br/>models predict? It is likely that many of the solutions involve tidal or radiative interactions<br/>between the planet and its star, as these influences depend strongly on orbital distance. <br/><br/>Building upon past experience with tides and other problems in astrophysical fluid dynamics, Dr. Jeremy Goodman's research team will investigate the interrelations between tidal dissipation, irradiation, and mass loss, with particular attention to the outer layers of hot Jupiters. The tools will be semianalytic estimates and one dimensional calculations rather than multidimensional simulations. <br/><br/>Tidal dissipation is among the oldest unsolved problems in theoretical astronomy. Because of their low surface gravity and inability to burn hydrogen, hot Jupiters are structurally more sensitive to tidal dissipation than stars and may better preserve a memory of past tidal influences. So the<br/>study of these objects may yield insights applicable to tidal interactions more generally. Besides, extrasolar planets are of great interest to the public as well as to professional astronomers because of the lessons they may have to teach about the history of our own solar system, and perhaps even the possibilities for life beyond earth. <br/>***

This award supports theoretical and computational research and education on the photophysics of (1) thin films of -conjugated polymers, and (2) semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes.<br/><br/>In (1), the PI aims to understand the mechanism of charge generation in thin films of (a) single-component polymers as well as (b) heterostructures consisting of polymer blends. The PI will investigate the roles of morphology and interchain interactions, and develop a theory that will describe simultaneously excitons, excimers and exciplexes, and free and bound polaron pairs. In the single-component polymers the PI aims to resolve an old controversy regarding the origin of polaron-derived states in thin films near the optical threshold. The PI hypothesizes that photoexcitation in the presence of significant interchain interactions leads to branching and generates a polaron-pair state directly.<br/>The PI will perform calculations on simplified models to support this key idea and propose further detailed calculations. In the polymer blends the PI notes that the binding energy of the interchain exciton generated by charge-transfer or the wavelength dependence of the charge generation cannot be understood within the simple wisdom that the band offset be larger than the binding energy of the intrachain exciton. Calculations for the single-component systems will be extended to the blends.<br/>In (2) the PI has two broad goals. The first is to reach quantitative understanding of the nonlinear and modulation optical spectroscopic experiments that are being performed for chirally enriched specific nanotubes. The PI aims to quantitatively understand (a) the energetics of the low-energy dark excitons, (b) the Aharonov-Bohm effect in semiconducting nanotubes and the transfer of oscillation strength from the bright to the dark exciton in magneto-optic spectroscopy, (c) optical absorptions polarized transverse to the nanotube axis, and (d) electroabsorpion. The second goal is to develop sophisticated theoretical and computational techniques to understand the physics of higher energy excitons and even multiexcitons.<br/><br/>Graduate students and the postdoctoral fellow working on the project will gain experience at the interface of physics, chemistry and optics. An undergraduate student will also be involved in the research. Exciting new research results will be incorporated into an interdisciplinary graduate course. The P.I. participates as a mentor in the Student Exit Project in the Cienaga High School in Vail, Arizona. In addition, one to two presentations per year on careers in science in the same high school are planned. The P.I. also participates in a Binational Consortium in Optics, which involves exchange of information with scientists and students from Institutes in Mexico. Existing international cooperation with scientists in India will be continued. New international collaborations with scientists from India as well as Italy are being initiated.<br/><br/><br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>The Division of Materials Research and the Chemistry Division contribute funds to this award. This award supports theoretical and computational research and education seeking to understand how light interacts with nanostructures, particularly large molecules and carbon nanotubes. The PI uses computer simulation and theory to gain insight at a microscopic level. The interactions between electrons in these nanostructures can be very strong and lead to new effects, novel microscopic processes, or unusual optical properties. During the past twenty years conjugated polymers and molecules have evolved from laboratory curiosities to key new optical materials. The work supported by this award is interdisciplinary involving condensed matter physics and materials chemistry. It contributes to the intellectual base from which of new technologies for nanoscale electronics, computation, and nanostructured materials may emerge.<br/><br/>Graduate students and the postdoctoral fellow working on the project will gain experience at the interface of physics, chemistry and optics.

Previous primate studies have upheld these predictions, whereby species consume different foods or divide the habitat structurally. However, sympatric hylobatids (gibbons and siamangs) pose a conundrum, broadly overlapping in ecology, using the same part of the canopy and eating the same foods. Due to higher body mass, siamangs are expected to win access to resources during encounters with smaller-bodied gibbons. So, the question remains how these species can coexist. While the greatest competition is expected between ecologically-similar taxa, primates must also contend with other local species. For hylobatids, langurs are one such taxon. They approximate small gibbons in body mass, but their physiology allows them to subsist on more fibrous, lower-quality foods, which might reduce competition. However, langurs live in larger groups and may therefore be able to displace gibbons. The proposed study will investigate competition among three primate species, siamangs (Symphalangus syndactylus), agile gibbons (Hylobates agilis) and mitered leaf monkeys (Presbytis melalophos) at Way Canguk, Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park, Indonesia. For 12 consecutive months resource availability will be monitored and focal data will be collected on feeding, locomotion, and space use. Based on intergroup encounters and playback experiments group ranks will be determined. To estimate energy intake food samples will be collected and analyzed for nutritional content. Thus, this study will explore 1) key factors influencing niche use, 2) dominance relationships between heterospecific groups, 3) how dynamic interactions promote coexistence, and 4) energetic consequences of rank. The intellectual merit of the proposed study is that it will increase understanding of ecological systems by extending models of same-species competition to interspecific competition. Energy intake and expenditure will be estimated to examine the impacts of differential behavioral tactics on individual fitness. Specifically, it will be investigated if subordinate species act as fugitives by fleeing direct competition and more rapidly utilizing renewed food patches than ecologically-similar dominants. Playback experiments will be used to understand how acoustic signals mitigate competition between species. The broader impact of this study includes the continuation of a collaborative tradition at Way Canguk among local assistants, Indonesian scientists, and international researchers. Three assistants have been employed to complete habituation of the study groups and help in data collection, and Indonesian students will be supervised. By providing the first data on agile gibbons and langurs on-site, this study will pave the way for future studies on these two species. The data collected will be shared with other researchers on-site for future collaborative work. Detailed examinations of energetic balance across animal communities may reveal differential impacts of habitat loss on species' survival and will therefore be integral in designing plans to conserve the primate community.

The project develops, pilots, and implements online professional development in support of inquiry, focusing on facilitation of student research. The goal is to determine what types of web-based experiences and resources are most effectively support middle school teachers in overcoming the substantial hurdles inherent in enabling students to design and conduct their own scientific experiments. Working closely with the New York State Department of Education, the project creates and tests a series of web-based professional development experiences for 7th and 8th grade teachers. The experiences support implementation of research by students using BirdSleuth curriculum resources developed with NSF funding by the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology.<br/><br/>BirdSleuth is well suited as a pilot project for developing online teacher support because it is designed to engage students in authentic scientific research: making observations, collecting data, asking their own questions, drawing conclusions through research and observation, and publishing their results. This project endeavors to create effective and efficient techniques for scaffolding teachers as they use BirdSleuth to guide students through the various stages of designing, conducting, analyzing, and presenting the results of scientific experiments. Project findings provide the basis for a sustainable set of online resources to serve the needs of BirdSleuth teachers nationwide. If successful at improving the ability of teachers to implement independent inquiry in their classrooms, the project also will serve as a model for online professional development in other STEM projects and disciplines.

Addition and isomerization reactions are the focus of the research, because they are atom-economical and waste-free. Bifunctional catalysts with reactivity of both a late transition metal and a group capable of proton transfer or hydrogen bonding will be studied. The coordination, hydrogen-bond donating and accepting properties of both catalytically active and inactive complexes will be studied in order to explain how they function as catalysts. The reaction mechanisms will also be modeled by computing the maps of the reaction potential energy surfaces using density functional theory. <br/><br/>With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Professors Douglas Grotjahn and Andrew L. Cooksy of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at San Diego State University. Their research efforts revolve around the development of new classes of catalysts for the addition of water, alcohols, or similar compounds to C-C double and triple bonds. A novel feature of the catalysts is that a metal and an organic group work together to enhance catalytic efficiency. Such chemistry will contribute to environmentally benign methods for chemical synthesis since the reactions produce no waste and are catalyzed. Successful development of the methodology will have an impact on synthesis in the pharmaceutical and agricultural industries.

Having added to the TekBot, a new robot, called NUBot is being developed by the Technology Development Corporation of the Peter Keitit Institute of the University of Nebraska. These robots are substantially less expensive, than most major commercial kits and use off the shelf parts from local electronics suppliers. <br/><br/>The leadership team creates materials for grades 5-8 that address and assess STEM concepts through a robotics curriculum. The curriculum addresses STEM standards through such documents as the NCTM Focal Points and the Atlas of Science Literacy. There are three problem based ways in which students can use the TekBot: building, moving, and programming. The intent is to scale up to a cyber-infrastructure that supports the national distribution and implementation of the curriculum. The cyber-infrastructure provides for summer workshops, distance education, a means of permitting teachers to identify lesson plans based upon their educational objectives, and an internet on call technician as means of teacher professional development.

This motion law is a very useful model in<br/>materials science for phase boundary motions, which appear in<br/>thermal grooving, grain boundary migration, sintering, and many<br/>other instances. Even though the model was proposed by Mullins<br/>in the 1950s, analysis and understanding of the model is still<br/>far from complete, due to the lack of sufficient mathematical<br/>tools. Many issues such as existence of solutions, their<br/>qualitative behaviors, and singularity formations are still wide<br/>open. The project analyzes surface diffusion from a variational<br/>approach, which has proved to be quite versatile for many similar<br/>motion laws. Questions to be investigated include approximation<br/>and construction of solutions, the analysis of crystalline facet<br/>motions, and the understanding of solutions exhibiting<br/>self-similarity structures. The outcomes can benefit both the<br/>mathematical and materials science communities. <br/><br/> The use of mathematics in the modeling and analysis of<br/>materials science phenomena has become more and more important,<br/>in particular with the current continued outgrowth of<br/>nanotechnology. The properties of real materials very often are<br/>linked to the presence of inhomogeneity and defects such as phase<br/>boundaries and triple junctions. Successful understanding of<br/>these structures, especially their dynamical response behavior,<br/>requires intricate mathematical tools. This project aims to<br/>introduce new mathematical techniques to study phenomena of<br/>surface diffusion that have been proposed and experimentally<br/>observed for a long time, though many questions remain unsettled. <br/>The scientific merit of the project includes a better<br/>understanding of the materials and their response under various<br/>external environments. The project also provides an excellent<br/>opportunity for interdisciplinary research and educational<br/>activities that can tie together mathematical and engineering<br/>sciences, and graduate students are involved in the work.

Specifically, Meersmann  and his group will develop methods of creating hyperpolarized Kr-83 as a sensitive probe of the chemical composition of surfaces.  In addition, Prof. Meersmann and his team will develop a means of producing nuclear spin-polarized gas molecules for in situ monitoring of high temperature reactions such as combustion.  <br/> <br/>Magnetic resonance imaging is a powerful, non-invasive method for obtaining chemically-specific images of materials.  Its use in materials and medical imaging are ubiquitous.  Prof. Meersmann and his young colleagues will develop new methodologies for these imaging methods using hyperpolarized probe gases.  One potential application of the methods developed in the Meersmann laboratory would be the use of chemically-inert Kr-83 as a MRI contrast agent for in vivo imaging of lung surfaces -- a potentially important tool in diagnosing certain types of respiratory diseases.  Besides the broader scientific and societal impact of the research supported in this award, Prof. Meersmann will continue to train a diverse group of young scientists in modern magnetic resonance methods.<br/>

Beyond a careful treatement of†the result†and its implications, the aim†is to extend it†to more general theories;†this seems to†relate to the factorization properties for†GW invariants†(Ionel-Parker,†Li) and to the structural results in the†open/closed†string case (Kontsevich, Costello). A second†project is†the study†of gauged Gromov-Witten theory, where†twisted†K-theories and representations of†loop groups appear.†Loop groups also feature in the third project, pertaining†to the geometric Langlands programme, where the cohomological calculations of the PI (with E. Frenkel) offer a way forward form the results of Beilinson-Drinfeld, toward the 'derived' version of the Langlands correspondence. (Recent work of Gukov-Kapustin-Witten suggest a controlling topological†field<br/>theory.) Current work by the PI (with C.Woodward)†extending to Higgs bundles results of coherent cohomology†previously†known for principal bundles is an important step. Other, and more speculative†projects include†a study of†non-semisimple 3-dimensional TFT's associated to†derived†categories. † †<br/><br/><br/>Topological Field theory is a spectacular and unforeseen application†of ideas from modern quantum physics to†topology: that is the field of mathematics which, broadly speaking, studies the†properties of†shapes that are stable under†continuous deformations. Previous applications of the†foundational†problems of quantum physics to†mathematics†had dominated†development in mathematical analysis for†decades,†but their emergence in topology in the 1980's†came as a surprise. Crudely put, the new†ideas exploit a†topological irreversibility of time flow: a topological†change in space-time can usually not be 'undone' in the†future. This led to the encoding of information in new kinds of algebraic structures (technically, they are monoids rather than groups).<br/>The new methods succeeded in unifying†existing†invariants of knots and†links with those of 3-and†4-dimensional structures†(manifolds).<br/>New invariants†could†be defined that bear†stunning relations to other fields of†mathematics which†study finer, but less robust structures†(algebraic geometry and complex analysis).†The PI's research†focuses on instances of these structures where, in addition, a continuous group of symmetries is present in the system,†and studies the refined structures that emerge.†††

Properties of ecosystems constrain the range of possible pathways for agricultural intensification, and the nature of agricultural production can influence aspects of human societies. At the same time, human societies create and develop specific systems of agricultural production that transform ecosystems, sometimes in dramatic ways. The Hawaiian Archipelago offers excellent opportunities to explore the nature and consequences of interactions among ecosystems, agricultural systems, and human societies as they played out over centuries prior to European contact. This collaborative research project will focus on intensive agriculture and society in Kohala, Hawai'i, where broad and well-defined environmental gradients encompass a large (60 km-square) and long-sustained rain-fed dryland agricultural system that was abandoned in the mid-19th century. With participation from local communities and schools, experimental gardens will be established across the range of the field system. This effort will draw on community input (traditional knowledge), archaeological observations, and ecosystem/soil analyses in addition to agricultural experimentation. Once in place, these gardens will be used to develop physiologically based agricultural crop models and to determine how the agricultural system was organized and integrated; how it was sustained for centuries prior to European contact; and how it interacted with nearby irrigated systems. This last effort will make use of strong differences in the abundances of multiple stable isotopes across the broad environmental gradient of Kohala.<br/><br/>The establishment of experimental gardens within the boundaries of the ancient and long-abandoned Kohala field system will serve several scientific and educational objectives. A well-validated crop model for dryland crops will allow much more detailed calculations of agricultural yields; these in turn will make existing models of past agricultural production and human demography across the Kohala landscape more realistic. Similarly, isotopic measurements of Hawaiian crops will support detailed interpretations of sources of food and other goods as these varied over space, time, and the social status of households in pre-contact Hawai'i. Together these efforts will make it possible to determine how this and other large, rain-fed agricultural systems functioned and how they interacted with nearby communities based on irrigated agriculture. The project therefore will contribute to understanding the evolution of complex societies. The gardens represent an extraordinary educational resource because they will make a step toward restoring an example of the main pre-contact agricultural system on the island of Hawai'i. School and community groups will make use of these gardens to learn science by conducting field experiments in a culturally meaningful setting. This project is supported by an award resulting from the NSF competition focusing on the Dynamics of Coupled Natural and Human Systems.

This partnership brings together experts in bioacoustics, ocean acoustics, physical oceanography, remote sensing, and GIS analysis to overcome this limitation. The PIs will collect a synoptic data set over appropriate spatial scales on cetacean distributions and physical and biological processes on the West Florida Shelf. This data set will provide an unprecedented ability to resolve questions about the influences of physical, biological, and anthropogenic noise on the distribution of cetaceans. <br/><br/>Cetaceans make a wide variety of vocalizations. Species observed in deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico typically produce vocalizations ranging from 5 to 40 kHz. A newly developed acoustic recorder, the Digital SpectroGram recorder (DSG), will be used to overcome the data storage and battery problems associated with other recorder designs. A sparse array of 73 DSG recorders will be deployed over a 48,750 km2 area, to determine the relative spatial and temporal distribution of cetaceans on the West Florida Shelf. Towed array recordings will also be used to determine source levels of cetacean vocalizations to model the effective sampling area of each recorder. A library of sounds produced by the cetaceans on the West Florida Shelf will also be compiled from existing recordings and new array recordings to analyze species-specific distributions. <br/><br/>How noise levels affect cetacean distribution and activity is an important element of cetacean stock management. The hydrophone array will be used to quantify ambient noise levels and to model sound propagation on the West Florida Shelf. Concurrent physical and biological oceanographic data will be collected; in-situ, with satellite remote sensing, and interpreted with the aid of numerical circulation models. With this multilayered data set, we will be able to investigate the spatial and temporal patterns of oceanographic variables on the West Florida Shelf in a multidisciplinary manner. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/><br/>These data will form a baseline that can be used to understand how marine mammals react to noise sources, such as seismic surveys. This work will also involve the education of a Ph.D.-level graduate student.

This is an exciting new area at the intersection of inorganic chemistry and physical chemistry. The team will develop rational methods to modify giant, spherical molybdenum-oxide based nanocapsules so that charge densities and internal/external functionalities can be accurately adjusted for solution/assembly experiments. The collaborators plan to use various physical techniques to understand the attraction between anionic capsules and small cations, as well as the response of the nanocapsules to changes in external conditions. This study will facilitate the understanding of strong attractive forces between charged nanoparticles and self-assembly processes in general. The research will have a broad impact on other fields, such as materials science, synthetic chemistry, physics and biology. Professors Liu and M¸ller will organize a number of important international symposia to extensively communicate their results with leading scientists from various countries. Dissemination is also planned via articles in popular science magazines. Postdoctoral associates and graduate and undergraduate students will be involved in enriching technical and cultural exchanges between the US and Germany.

Westerland<br/><br/>This research agenda has three parts. In the first, the<br/>principal investigator proposes to study algebraic structures<br/>inherent in the geometry of moduli spaces, particularly those<br/>that have not been studied from an operadic point of view and<br/>including several families of moduli spaces from differential<br/>geometry, algebraic geometry, and physics. The second part of<br/>the proposal concerns applications of this study of moduli spaces<br/>to objects in homotopy theory, including equivariant homology for<br/>the free loop space on a manifold, string topology operations for<br/>a topological version of cyclic homology, and string topology of<br/>classifying spaces of Lie groups. The third major project will<br/>apply techniques from stable homotopy theory to the study of<br/>Hurwitz spaces, in a collaboration with number theorists.<br/><br/>Moduli spaces are geometric objects that describe the variability<br/>of other geometric objects. For example, any element of the<br/>collection of all spheres centered at the origin in Euclidean<br/>three-dimensional space is completely determined by the radius of<br/>the circle, a positive number, so the collection of all these<br/>spheres (each of which is a two-dimensional object) is described<br/>by the positive half of the real number line (a one-dimensional<br/>object). A moduli space of particular interest in this and other<br/>ongoing mathematical research describes the variable geometry of<br/>a surface such as the surface of a two-holed doughnut with<br/>several points labeled or marked on it, a construction which<br/>provides access to important questions of quantum field theory,<br/>algebra, and geometry.

0724704	CMG Research: Multiscale data integration using facies based hierarchical Bayesian models	DMS	OPPORTUNITIES FOR RESEARCH CMG, MATHEMATICAL GEOSCIENCES	09/01/2007	08/03/2007	Bani Mallick	TX	Texas A&M Research Foundation	Standard Grant	Junping Wang	08/31/2012	$650,000.00	Akhil Datta-Gupta, Yalchin Efendiev	bmallick@stat.tamu.edu	400 Harvey Mitchell Parkway, S	College Station	TX	778454321	9798458600	MPS	7215, 7232	0000, 7232, 7303, OTHR	$0.00	This project focuses on uncertainty quantification for integrated geologic facies models. In many geologic environments, the distribution of subsurface properties is primarily controlled by the location and distribution of distinct geologic facies with sharp contrasts in properties across facies boundaries. Under such conditions, the orientation of the channels and channel geometry determine the flow behavior in the subsurface rather than the detailed variation in properties within the channels. Traditional geostatistical techniques for subsurface characterization have typically relied on variograms that are unable to reproduce the channel geometry and the facies architecture. Recently geostatistical models based on multiplepoint statistics have been proposed for reproduction of complex channel architecture. These methods rely on training images that can be difficult to obtain. In this project coherent Bayesian hierarchical models will be developed which will preserve the facies architecture and populate the petrophysically properties within the facies in a geologically consistent manner by incorporating available static and dynamic information. To maintain the contrast in facies properties, facies boundaries will be represented by level sets which represent variety of facies topology including splitting and merging of facies boundaries. The method relies on a Bayesian hierarchical approach to perturb the facies boundaries and properties to match the dynamic flow and transport data and multiphase production history at the wells. A novel aspect of the approach is the choice of a Langevian-type proposal perturbation of facies boundaries combined with multiscale simulations that allows us to implement efficient MCMC methods with higher acceptance rate without sacrificing the convergence characteristics. The facies based hierarchical formalism lends itself readily to efficient multiscale flow simulation with adaptivity that can provide significant speed up in the flow and transport calculations. The hierarchical approach will naturally integrate data from different scales and allow to condition on local hard and soft data. Proper exploitation of Bayesian simulation based algorithm will enable us to perform posterior inference to quantify uncertainty based on this model.<br/><br/>The basic idea, novel models and algorithms developed by the project will significantly advance the current state-of-the-art in subsurface characterization by incorporating qualitative geological information into quantitative spatial modeling of properties. These, in turn, will improve the ability to model, scale-up and design problems related to environmental remediation, contaminant transport and CO2 sequestration in hydrocarbon reservoirs/aquifers. The focus of the application will be on CO2 sequestration in depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs. The sequestration of CO2 into geologic formations is a promising solution for reducing environmental hazards created by the release of green house gases in to the earth's atmosphere. In particular, existing and depleted oil and gas reservoirs are attractive candidates for CO2 sequestration for two principal reasons. First, the economic benefits associated with enhanced oil recovery through CO2 injection are commercially proven and widely practiced by the industry. Second, oil and gas reservoirs are likely to provide abundant data sources for subsurface characterization, design and performance assessment of any potential CO2 sequestration project.

The relationship between silicic volcanic and plutonic systems is a matter of great interest in petrology. Shallow crustal magma reservoirs are important because they are sites of magma storage and differentiation, they are commonly associated with ore deposits, and, what is especially significant to this proposal, the relations between such systems may provide important insights into magmatic and eruptive processes. Plausible textural fingerprints of eruptions have recently been recognized in some rhyolites and it is likely that similar markers of eruptions will be preserved in plutonic granites. The current project concerns: (1) Can fingerprints of eruptions be found in crystals of plutonic rocks? (2) Can these fingerprints be correlated with those in associated volcanic rocks? (3) What can be inferred about the eruption history of a system based on this plutonic record?<br/><br/>These questions will be addressed by studying crystal populations in plausibly correlated granites and rhyolites in terms of (a) trace-element zoning, (b) crystal size distributions, (c) the compositions of melts from which they grew, as recorded in melt inclusions, and (d) the ages of crystallization recorded by zircon crystals. The Colorado River Extensional Corridor (Nevada) includes several plutons and volcanic sequences where links between volcanic and plutonic systems have been documented. The exceptional exposures in this area of tilted plutons and volcanic units will provide a unique opportunity to explore the combined record in volcanic and plutonic rocks towards a better understanding of eruptions and the relationships between plutonic and volcanic magma systems.<br/><br/>Broader impacts.<br/>This project (as proposed) would support a post-doctoral associate, a graduate student, and one or more undergraduate students. This study will also involve collaboration between the PI and a team of geologists working in the Colorado River Extensional Corridor for more than a decade. Although principally a basic science project, The results of this work would be relevant to understanding the dynamics of volcanic systems and related volcanic hazards.

People make important decisions about which home to buy, which person to marry, which medical treatment to accept, and so on by estimating the hedonic value that each of these experiences will afford. But in the last decade, research by psychologists and behavioral economists has shown that these estimates are often wrong. That is, people often mispredict the hedonic value of future experiences and thus make suboptimal decisions that they later regret. Why does this happen?<br/><br/>Both the estimated and actual hedonic value of an experience depends on the other experiences to which it is compared. For example, chemotherapy may seem worse when compared with simple surgery than with a debilitating course of radiation. The comparisons people make are of two types. When a person compares an experience with other experiences he or she has had, will have, or could have had (e.g., At least this chemotherapy is not making me feel as bad as the radiation would have), the value of the experience is influenced by differences. But when a person compares an experience with the experience he or she was having in the previous moment (e.g., I am more nauseous than I was a few minutes ago), the value of the experience is influenced by changes.<br/><br/>The researchers suggest that as a general rule, when people are estimating the hedonic value of future experiences they tend to compute differences, but when they are actually having hedonic experiences they tend to compute changes. Because people make different comparisons at these two times, they often mispredict the hedonic value of future experiences. This proposal describes 13 studies that seek to investigate the causes and consequences of this phenomenon.

This project focuses on using small, faint satellite galaxies, orbiting within the gravitational potentials of large, bright field galaxies, to obtain a substantial improvement over the current halo constraints. The research will use a combination of theory, archival and new observations, and numerical datasets, to address a) the best halo virial mass estimator, b) how best to measure the velocity dispersion of satellite galaxies, c) the dependence of the mass-to-light ratio on luminosity, and whether this differs for early- and late-type galaxies, d) whether the halos of late-type galaxies are fundamentally different from those of early-type galaxies, and e) whether the angular momentum of a disk galaxy closely correlates with the net angular momentum of its halo.<br/><br/>The principal investigator will participate in Lowell Observatory's successful outreach program, targeting fifth through eighth grade students at Navajo and Hopi Nation Schools.

Their unusual electronic structures inherited from graphene, provides a multitude of electronic properties for the different nanotube species. The nanoscale size tubes is responsible for new properties which make them exceptionally promising as versatile optical sources and detectors. However, the amount of light emission from nanotubes is much lower than initially expected and limits their use in optical devices. For single wall carbon nanotubes, every atom is situated on the surface, and the environment will therefore be of importance. The goal of this proposal is to understand which of the observed properties are intrinsic to the nanotubes and which ones depend on the environment. It is also of importance to measure and understand the role of the different nanotube species. Samples are prepared such that a single nanotube at a time will be studied, in order to avoid averaging. The project will train two graduate students and involve 4 undergraduate students yearly, who will participate both in direct hands-on nanotube fabrication and optical measurements, as well as in the development of web tools for calculating the types of lattice vibrations that can be detected optically. <br/><br/><br/>Technical summary<br/><br/>The unusual electronic structure inherited from graphene, provides a multitude of electronic properties with both metallic nanotubes and semi-conducting nanotubes with varying band-gaps, promising as tunable optical sources and detectors. However, low quantum yield limits the current optical use of nanotubes. The goal of this proposal is to use optical methods such as Raman scattering, photoluminescence and photo-absorption to measure and understand the role of intrinsic nanotube properties and how they vary with chirality, and how those properties are affected by the environment. Samples are prepared such that a single nanotube at a time will be studied, in order to avoid averaging. The areas of interest are the environmental screening effects of excitions, the role of the dark excitons for the optical quantum yield and possibly its manipulation, and the different electronic dissipation pathways provided by phonon interactions. The project will train two graduate students and involve 4 undergraduate student yearly, who will participate both in direct hands-on nanotube fabrication and optical measurements, as well as in the development of web tools for calculating phonon dispersions, phonon density of states, and with help of group theory to identify which of the many of the tube's phonon modes that are Raman active.
0724736	The Balance Sheet of Nature: Markets, Quantification and the New York Farm, 1830-1860	SES	Hist & Philosophy of SET	08/01/2007	08/05/2007	Robert Kohler	PA	University of Pennsylvania	Standard Grant	Frederick M Kronz	08/31/2008	$7,675.00		rkohler@sas.upenn.edu	Research Services	Philadelphia	PA	191046205	2158987293	SBE	1353	0000, OTHR	$0.00	During the mid-nineteenth century, tens of thousands of Americans responded to agricultural instability and developing market economies by involving themselves in agricultural improvement. As authors, readers, experimenters, consumers, critics and observers, improvers promoted widespread changes to farming practice. In particular, they supported the rise of agricultural chemistry as a way of understanding processes of transformation on the farm economically. Chemistry was to help farmers see land as a bank, the nitrogen in the atmosphere as the capital of nature, eating as a form of transaction, and the landscape of mixed-farming as a constant cycling of atoms of capital. This project will explore the ways in which the numerical practices of the early nineteenth century's developing market economy supported and resisted this economic understanding of nature between 1830 and 1860, placing chemical analysis in the context of changing surveying, accounting, and mensuration practices. Focusing on improvers' activity in New York State, it will ask how new market values and quantitative practices changed the way that farmers understood and interacted with landscapes, plants, and animals. In preparation for this project, the researcher has examined the role of statewide institutions of improvement in integrating the New York landscape into the market system. The funding requested from NSF will permit the researcher to examine the role of quantification in the lives of working farmers. Where research about urban institutions can be conducted with the assistance of archival grants, research on rural populations requires extensive research in dispersed local archives, which cannot afford to fund researchers. Lack of funding has led to the neglect of vital resources. For such research, support from the NSF is crucial. This proposal therefore requests funding for 11 short research trips to a total of 26 archives in New York State, to be taken between August and December of 2007. During these trips the researcher will examine farm diaries, letters and account books, as well as the records of local agricultural improvement societies. These documents will provide evidence of changes in numerical and farming practices, for example in the form of recorded feeding and fertilizer experiments, altered accounting and mensuration practices, use of agricultural maps and surveys and discussions of economic conditions and land values. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit. This project will illuminate the spread of quantified ways of knowing nature, connecting them to economic modes of calculation. As such, it will contribute to a growing literature in the history of science that describes the rise of quantification and quantifying practices during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. While scholars like Theodore Porter and Mary Poovey have focused primarily on urban experts such as economists, actuaries, and accountants, this project will extend to the rural population of improving farmers. Looking at those who worked to manage living organisms and make them profitable, it will increase our understanding of the connection between sciences and changing modes of production, and of the development of a managerial approach to natural processes. Further, by exploring the mix of expert and lay interests that made up agricultural improvement, and analyzing the different ways in which chemical and geological theories were strategically deployed, the project will add a new dimension to the literature on popular science. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts. The results of this project will be presented at the conferences of several disciplinary groups: historians of science, environmental historians, and agricultural historians. It will also form the basis of articles to be sent to professional journals and will ultimately be incorporated into a monograph. The results will also be integrated into the researcher's teaching, as part of classes in environmental history and the history of science. The success of books like The Omnivore's Dilemma and Fast Food Nation indicates powerful public interest in the cycles of nutrition that end in the food on their plates. The processes of industrialization that fascinate modern readers began with the commoditization of the farm ecosystem. Through this research we will better understand how the ecologies of modern farming have come to be economically organized.

Some European states currently are dismantling their existing multicultural policies and are adopting new policies designed to better facilitate the integration of immigrants into the host society. Researchers have analyzed the changes in immigrant integration and citizenship policies at the national scale, but work on the implementation of these policies through local integration projects in impacted neighborhoods has been missing. Also neglected has been the role of immigrants in the implementation of local integration projects. This doctoral dissertation research project will examine the goals, work, and outcomes of local integration projects in Marzahn, a neighborhood in Berlin that has a high concentration of recent ethnic German migrants from the former Soviet Union. The doctoral candidate will seek answers to the following questions: (1) How do the integration goals and the underlying concepts of citizenship of local projects differ from national and provincial integration policies? (2) To what extent and how do immigrants participating in local integration projects modify project goals and outcomes? (3) How does the engagement in integration projects differ between immigrant men and women, and why? The student will use multiple methods to answer these questions. Analysis of national and provincial integration policy documents and expert interviews with local policy makers and project leaders will provide data regarding the differences between national, and provincial, and local integration objectives. Participant observation, focus groups, in-depth interviews, and immigrant diaries will provide data regarding how and why immigrants participate in integration projects and how they understand their own integration goals. The student hypothesizes that national and provincial integration objectives and their underlying conceptions of citizenship often are challenged and actively amended in the process of implementation by local institutions. In addition, she suspects that because women migrants participate in local integration activities more actively than men, they shape these projects to suit their distinct needs.<br/><br/>The results of this research will fill gaps in knowledge regarding the efficacy of local integration projects as well as on how local integration institutions and immigrants are actively involved in the transformation of integration objectives. Analysis of gender differences in project participation will provide insights into how immigrant men and women adapt to their new communities in different ways. Such insights are important for the formulation of gender-sensitive integration policies, a growing field of public policy in all major immigrant-destination countries, including the U.S. Furthermore, this study will bring scholarship on the politics of immigration integration into conversations regarding with theoretical perspectives on citizenship. Finally, by focusing on recent ethnic German immigrants from the former Soviet Union, the project it will provide insights into the specific integration challenges of migrants who have become citizens but remain culturally and socio-economically marginal. Until recently the integration needs of such naturalized migrants have received little attention and consideration in integration policy making. As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.

Current approaches to assuring the correct operation of embedded software face significant challenges in scaling to the next generation of embedded applications. A promising strategy for meeting these challenges is to deploy monitoring software that will watch and warn of problematic situations that the operational software should adapt to avoid. Unfortunately, current approaches for software monitoring result in excessive overhead and are not sensitive to the fundamental timeliness requirements in embedded software.<br/><br/>This project is investigating technologies for the timely and efficient monitoring of software in embedded systems. Specifically, the project explores the synergistic combination of three approaches: (1) exploiting the results of static analysis to calculate a minimal residual analysis problem to be monitored at run-time, (2) adapting the degree of observation of the software dynamically during execution while preserving the fidelity of monitoring, and (3) using scheduling techniques to ensure that monitors detect patterns of software behavior with a predictable worst-case delay. Together these techniques are being combined into a single predictable, adaptable, residual (PAR) monitoring infrastructure within which a variety of implementation strategies will be realized. Evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of these techniques will be carried out in the context of RTSJ and sensor-network infrastructures and applications. These techniques and the PAR infrastructure are the basis for projects in both real-time systems and software validation courses to train the next generation of embedded software engineers.

Patterns and behaviors (especially of humans) will be parsed by a hierarchy of probabilistic grammars and other mechanisms into a compact and more descriptive semantic form. These higher-level interpretations of the data will provide the necessary network cognition needed to provide services in many everyday life applications such as assisted living, workplace safety, security, entertainment and more. The project will use a lightweight camera sensor network as its primary platform and will focus on two types of spatio-temporal data processing. At the local sensor's field of view, this research will investigate the design of filters for robustly detecting humans as well as their gestures and postures. At a more macroscopic level, collections of sensors will coordinate to detect longer term patterns of behavior. The expected outcome is a new data interpretation framework that can understand the spatial and temporal aspects of data and respond to them with meaningful services. To collect real data and to demonstrate the developed concepts in practical applications, this work will use assisted living as the driver application. In this context, the developed sensor network will supervise the behaviors of elders living alone at home to generate daily activity summaries, post warnings and alarms when they engage in dangerous activities, and provide a variety of services that increase the autonomy and independence of these individuals.

The proposed vehicle will slide up and down a towed wire in a controlled manner using the lift created by wing foils. Wing foils will provide a novel low power method of propulsion that utilizes the free stream velocity of the wire moving through the water. In the full size vehicle a battery powered electronics package consisting of a small microprocessor, depth sensor and motor actuator will control the foil angle in a closed loop fashion to achieve a desired depth or depth profile. A payload bay within the vehicle will accommodate a variety of oceanographic water column sensors. <br/><br/>The main benefits such a vehicle will provide are two fold. Preliminary evaluation of this new concept suggests the wire flying vehicle could achieve glide ratios of one-to-one or greater over a wide operating range of tow configurations. This would provide greater horizontal resolution in deep water than is currently possible with undulated towed bodies in shallow water. Additionally, this system would be used in conjunction with any towed instrument package and produce a complementary data set that could not be obtained by the tow body alone. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/><br/>The proposed continued development of a wire flying profiler can potentially benefit many different disciplines throughout oceanography, independently of geographical area. The most tangible impacts are likely to be increased understanding of deep ocean mixing and of small features such as submesoscale eddies that can play major roles in material transport. These impacts will directly and significantly impact, through improved understanding of mixing and small-scale dynamics, our ability to run global models including those used for prediction of climate change impacts. This in itself comprises a broad and significant societal benefit. Outreach activities are not specifically mentioned but are likely, in any case, to be difficult within the context of a technological development project. One graduate student, and several undergraduate students, will gain experience in engineering and use of oceanographic instrumentation.

The project advocates a different approach<br/>than previous work in this area by formally defining comprehensive<br/>requirements for protocol security, rather than imposing new<br/>technologies to address one or two specific exploits.<br/><br/>The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) provides best-effort connectivity<br/>between the component networks of the Internet, a task called<br/>interdomain routing. However, BGP lacks any security mechanism,<br/>allowing accidental router misconfiguration or intentional attacks<br/>that have far-reaching effects on network stability and traffic<br/>flow. Furthermore, simply adding security mechanisms is insufficient<br/>because BGP also lacks the guarantee that specification-compliant<br/>inputs always produce stable routes across the network.<br/><br/>This project addresses these shortcomings through research on various<br/>assumptions that guarantee good routing behavior and on methods to<br/>verify or enforce these assumptions to prevent deviation from that<br/>behavior. We identify and address attacks that have previously been<br/>studied as well as new attacks that have not yet received attention in<br/>the literature. We target incremental-deployment benefits and<br/>computational efficiency as primary desiderata; thus, our solutions<br/>can offer incentives for immediate adoption without system-wide<br/>changes. Through its educational component, our project introduces<br/>students to cross-disciplinary research. This encourages collaboration<br/>in research projects and allows development of coursework integrating<br/>security, networking, and theory for a timely application domain.

This engine will utilize power-law metrics to extract statistical proportions of music-theoretic and other attributes of music pieces (e.g., Pitch, Duration, Pitch Distance, Duration Distance, Melodic Intervals, Harmonic Intervals, Melodic Bigrams, etc.).<br/>The engine searches for pieces that are aesthetically similar to the input piece using a mean squared error (MSE) approach. Preliminary testing has been done using the Classical Music Archives corpus (14,695 MIDI pieces), combined with 500+ MIDI pieces from other styles (e.g. Jazz, Rock, Country, etc.). Similar metrics have already been validated on aesthetic attributes of textual materials. Text results (author attribution, style identification, and pleasantness prediction) indicated an high level of accuracy. Assessment and validation experiments will be conducted to compare to computational findings indicating aesthetic similarity of retrieved pieces. These experiments will be conducted by Prof. Dwight Krehbiel (subaward, Bethel College), a specialist in cognitive neuroscience and psychology of music, who has extensive experience in measuring emotional and physiological responses to music.

The visit will help develop a detailed international collaborative research study of assemblages of myxomycetes and fungi associated with several different types of aerial microhabitats in the tropical forests of northern Thailand.<br/>Tropical forests are thought to be the terrestrial ecosystems characterized by the highest fungal biodiversity, but a major portion of this biodiversity has yet to be documented. This is particularly true for the tropical forests of Southeast Asia. The inherent compositional and structural complexity of tropical forest communities is manifested in a diverse array of aerial microhabitats, most of which have no counterparts in either boreal forests or temperate forests. The research to be carried out in the proposed project would represent the first effort to characterize the assemblages of organisms associated with aerial microhabitats in these forests. <br/><br/>There is sufficient overlap of interests between researchers at the University of Arkansas and the Thailand Mushroom Research foundation and Chiang Mai University to indicate that they can successfully pursue the activities proposed, and that the interaction will benefit both sides. It is anticipated that the research project would contribute to a more complete understanding of the overall biodiversity of tropical forest ecosystems in this region of the world. In addition, the proposed involvement of two US graduate students will enable these early-career researchers to gain valuable international perspective and insight. It is likely that their Thailand counterparts would learn new techniques and acquire basic expertise in both the organisms and the microhabitats being studied. The U.S. researchers plan to make both oral and poster presentations at the annual meeting of the Arkansas Academy of Science and the Mycological Society of America. The graduate students would be expected to develop a web site providing information and images related to their research experience in Thailand. In addition, the data (e.g., species lists of myxomycetes and fungi) generated as a result of the planning visit would be made available to the public and the scientific community on the Eumycetozoan PBI/PEET web site (http://slimemold.uark.edu).

This first year of implementation is part of a phased-in implementation for subsequent grades. The NTHS approach calls for moving from more traditional approaches to mathematics and science education to project-based curriculula that posits mathematics and science in the context of real world issues and problesm. The study is time sensitive because there are two schools in Indiana that will begin implementation in the summer of 2007, and the study must begin the collection of baseline data in the fall of 07. Both schools are in urban districts with historically low levels of student performance. Examining how a whole community of students and teachers adapt to a new and more inquiry-oriented approach for science and mathematics isntruciton provides a unique opportunity for studying professional development, whole school implementation of technology supported project-based curricula, and assessing student results.

XPS is a highly sensitive tool that can identify different elements present in a sample and determine their concentrations. Some of the research projects that will significantly benefit from the availability of XPS include efforts to produce magnetic behavior in semiconductors such as silicon, development of new materials to solve biological and biomedical research problems, relative movement of atoms inside a material when subjected to high temperatures, toxic and flammable gas detection, corrosion of surfaces, coating toxic materials with benign molecules, and magnetic materials.

As a part of the innate immune system, they are potent against a broad spectrum of pathogens. Because they are derived from host tissue and have a non-specific mechanism of killing bacteria, AMPs have potential as novel pharmaceutical agents. They are often not as effective against bacteria in vitro as they are in vivo, and sometimes they are toxic to the host tissue. Here it is hypothesized that proper presentation and localization of AMPs onto biocompatible materials will increase their potency against pathogens and limit toxicity toward host cells in vitro. The objectives are to develop nanoscale-patterned surfaces presenting AMPs and to use these systems to quantify the antimicrobial activity and host cell toxicity in response to AMP presentation. A further objective is to modify collagen, currently in wide use as a biocompatible surface coating, with AMPs. The broader objective is to create biomaterials that mimic the in vivo presentation of AMPs to pathogens. The focus is on three AMPs expressed by human ocular surface epithelia. These species will be attached to biocompatible materials with control over density, spacing, and nanoscale patterning to investigate the effect of local AMP concentration and patterning on microbiocidal activity and corneal epithelial cell toxicity. The proposed research capitalizes on a new means of precisely controlling the presentation of AMPs on a size scare not previously available. It will allow quantification of microbiocidal effectiveness and host cell toxicity in response to nanoscale presentation of AMPs. <br/><br/>BROADER IMPACTS: The proposed work is aimed directly at improvements in contact lens fabrication to inhibit eye infections. In addition to these and other novel antimicrobial devices that might emerge from this work, the project will yield new fundamental insights into the mechanism by which AMPs disrupt the bacterial membrane and the role of AMP concentration and cooperativity in determining their activity. The research program will provide interdisciplinary research experience for undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral level students. The PI will team with successful University of Houston minority outreach programs to Houston area high schools. He also plans to establish an undergraduate summer internship program with Texas Southern University, a historically minority university located near the University of Houston. Feeder school relationships with Xavier University, Prairie View A&M, and Texas Southern exist to provide research and educational programs accessible to women and minorities.

These networks are typically too complex to lend themselves to an exact analysis. The primary goal of this research is to develop new techniques for obtaining a variety of asymptotic approximations for these systems. Specifically, these include so-called fluid or first-order approximations that describe the mean behavior of the system, diffusion approximations that capture fluctuations around the mean, and large deviations approximations that provide estimates for the probabilities of rare events that are critical to the working of the system. These techniques will be applied to gain insight into the behavior of several concrete classes of networks. In particular, new admission control algorithms will be developed for so-called ?real-time? systems that process tasks with deadlines such as, for example, telecom systems carrying digitized voice and tracking systems. In addition, estimates of performance measures will be obtained for multi-server systems that arise in call centers. We will also investigate the equilibrium properties of networks with blocking (used to model mobile wireless networks), as well as the stability of networks utilizing so-called bang-bang controls. <br/>One of the mathematical challenges in analyzing stochastic networks is that they are often described by constrained processes that exhibit discontinuous transitions, and so much of the classical theory can no longer be applied. If successful, this research would provide a new set of mathematical tools for the analysis of such constrained processes, which could be of broader applicability. The research also has the potential to contribute to improving the design and control of real-time queueing networks, call centers and wireless networks, which could lead to greater economy in the running of these systems.

This will provide a unique opportunity for nanoscale imaging without the challenges of using short wavelength radiation or the limitations of inferring 3-D structure from spectroscopic information. The approach is to use the interconnect available in current deep submicron CMOS integrated circuit technology to construct a near-field imaging 3-D cylindrical array of nanometer sized probes, into which nanoscale objects can be placed to be imaged using subwavelength electromagnetic radiation. <br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this research stems from challenges in the fabrication of the probe array and cavity, and development of the wetting technology to deliver nanoparticles and biomolecules to the imaging site. In addition, the decoding of the measured signals from the 3-D sensor probes, to produce structural information about nanometer-sized objects is mathematically challenging.<br/><br/>This research will have broad impact in proteomics and nanoparticle research. In the RCBS Protein Data Bank, there are a total of 25 diseases and 112 gene clusters without 3-D structural information available for the encoded proteins; many of the encoded proteins have never been found naturally and cannot yet be synthesized, due to inability to duplicate the protein folding conditions required. Developing the proposed probe device will allow the massively parallel screening necessary to find the protein folding conditions, potentially leading to many disease cures. Aspects of this research will be incorporated into K-12 educational initiatives, and participation of underrepresented groups will be actively sought.

A study of the presence and, equally telling, the strategic absence of a spoken local variety of German in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, can indicate how speakers enter into national discourses of equal rights, what it means to be a group with a distinct history or ethnicity, and ultimately what it means to be a minority group. In 1824 the first immigrants from Hunsruck (an area in the southwest of today''s Germany) arrived in Rio Grande do Sul to face a harsh physical environment and hostilities from indigenous and neighboring peoples. Today, some 700,000 people in Rio Grande do Sul speak Hunsruckisch German, the last significant wave of German immigrants having arrived just after World War II. <br/><br/>The research will use ethnographic and formal linguistic research methods to analyze how speech styles relate to nonlinguistic (aesthetic) styles, and how these relate to the representation of other ethnic minorities in Brazil. Data will be gathered by living with Hunsruckisch speakers in two different sites, accompanying them to gatherings that nonHunsruckisch speakers attend as well, and pursuing archival research. Linguistic samples will be recorded in both formal and informal contexts and the data will be analyzed for formal variation of specific linguistic features.<br/><br/>The research is important because it will aid in the understanding of the implications of immigrant identity for social relations and policy, and the role of language in a multilinguistic context in constructing it. The research also will contribute to the education of a social scientist.
0701292	Measure rigidity and smooth rigidity of abelian actions	DMS	ANALYSIS PROGRAM	09/01/2007	08/15/2007	Boris Kalinin	AL	University of South Alabama	Standard Grant	Bruce P. Palka	08/31/2011	$87,140.00		kalinin@psu.edu	307 University Boulevard	Mobile	AL	366880002	2514606333	MPS	1281	0000, 9150, OTHR	$0.00	The proposed research is in the realm of dynamical systems and smooth ergodic theory. The main goal of the project is to study smooth actions of (discrete and continuous) higher rank Abelian groups, actions that exhibit some degree of hyperbolicity. They represent natural generalizations of diffeomorphisms and flows on smooth manifolds. Such higher rank dynamical systems appear in various geometric and algebraic situations. The main examples include actions by commuting hyperbolic and partially hyperbolic automorphisms of tori and by commuting translations on cosets of Lie groups. In contrast to the properties of a single hyperbolic diffeomorphism or flow, many remarkable rigidity phenomena have been discovered for certain classes of higher rank Abelian actions. These phenomena include smooth rigidity, cocycle rigidity, and rigidity of invariant measures. Using dynamical, analytic, and group theoretic methods the principal investigator will further the study of such rigidity properties. In particular, he will consider broader classes of these actions than have been investigated hitherto, including nonalgebraic and nonuniformly hyperbolic actions. Another goal of the project is to study certain questions in smooth dynamics of a single Anosov or partially hyperbolic system.<br/><br/>Dynamical systems and ergodic theory are relatively new fields of mathematics that study the evolution of physical and mathematical systems over time (e.g., planetary motion, flow of air or other fluids). With origins in differential equations and celestial mechanics, these modern branches of mathematics provide numerous applications not only to other areas of mathematics but also to such natural sciences as physics, biology, meteorology, sociology, and computer science. Dynamical systems and ergodic theory have introduced new mathematical ideas into these sciences, including the study of long-term qualitative behavior, along with various analytic and probabilistic methods. One of the main goals of the proposed research is to investigate complex dynamical systems consisting of several different systems that ?commute? with each other, meaning that the evolution of any of the systems is not affected by the changes brought about by the others. Complex systems of this kind appear naturally in algebra, geometry, and physics. The recent study of such systems has produced exciting applications to number theory and quantum mechanics.

The emerging tele-immersive (TI) technology empowers and enables collaborative interactions and a plethora of new applications among geographically distributed sites. TI technology allows creation of a cyber TI room, where geographically separated users can jointly perform physical activities such as dance or exercise. This project is working to take this vision further and allow users to participate in simultaneous TI sessions and to cyber-walk between TI rooms. To achieve the TI rooms vision, the underlying cyber-physical infrastructure must consider both (a) streams of 3D data as a first class object in its design and in its deployment, and (b) holistic end-to-end management of the multi-stream environments for each TI room. Hence, the project is developing a Holistic Multi-stream Environment for Distributed Immersive Applications (H-MEDIA). They will investigate (a) system architectures with correlated multi-streaming; (b) real-time virtualization of resources for resource isolation between individual TI rooms and switching (cyber-walk) between rooms; (c) end-to-end configurable, robust and fault-tolerant virtual networks for different rooms; and (d) adaptive configuration and system management that will yield customizable, stable, adaptable, available and robust individual TI rooms. H-MEDIA research will have impact on communities in computer science and also on medical, social science and other domains. The H-MEDIA project will also result in educational benefits such as involving graduate students research in very novel TI technologies, inclusion of undergraduate students, and impact on education in other disciplines such as new teaching of choreography in TI environments, as well as many others.

This research will investigate the issues involved in the development of a search engine that supports geographic location retrieval, and its deployment in a setting involving digital government applications where it is also desirable to retrieve documents on the basis of spatial proximity. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: (1) Identifying geographic references in documents is a challenging issue and is necessary for advanced search applications. This is especially true in the case of users who want to browse large collections of documents that are not necessarily on the web and to explore and discover spatial relationships either in the same document or in a collection of documents. (2) Increasingly, users are looking for documents that contain spatially proximate content. Thus the traditional method of ranking by the link structure of the web is not appropriate. Determining the geographic focus of a document is a difficult task but is necessary in applications such as those dealing with documents on the hidden web, which is a set of documents, usually proprietary, that is for internal use of an organization and is often not available on the Internet. This means that there are few, if any links to these documents, and thus popular internet search strategies are not applicable. (3) Treating spatial content of documents as a first-class citizen, in the sense that a geographic scope is reported for each document that is retrieved regardless of whether the query has a spatial component, is difficult given the need to resolve issues related to aliasing (realizing that ''''Los Angeles'''' and ''''LA'''' are the same) and ambiguity (different interpretations for ''''London''''). (4) Developing query optimization and execution strategies for queries that involve both a textual and spatial component. (5) Developing effective techniques for measuring spatial similarity other than proximity, as well as techniques for measuring combinations of spatial and textual similarity. This includes the adaptation of the skyline operator. <br/><br/>Broad Impacts: The ability to retrieve documents on the basis of spatial proximity makes for a better search experience and will lead to more relevant results. The tools to be developed will also extend the reach of search engines from being restricted to documents on the internet to documents that reside on the hidden web. The deployment of these tools in government web sites via collaboration with the grant''s digital government partners has the effect of empowering citizens to find out what their government is doing, thereby leading to a more informed citizenry.

Typical examples of identities include your name and your social-security number, or your fingerprint/iris-scan, or your address, or your (non-revoked) Public-Key coming from some trusted public-key infrastructure. In many situations, however, where you are defines your identity. For example, we know the role of a bank-teller behind a bullet-proof bank window not because he or she shows us her<br/>credentials but by merely knowing her location. In this proposal, we ask the following question: is it possible to have the geographical position of a party take part in defining the set of credentials<br/>she has? What are the new possibilities in terms of what we can achieve in this setting?<br/><br/>First, we propose to consider the central task in this setting, i.e.,<br/>securely verifying the position of a device. Despite much work in this area, we have preliminary results that show that in the vanilla (i.e., standard) model, the above task (i.e., of secure<br/>positioning) is impossible to achieve.<br/><br/>We propose to study the proof of position in the bounded storage model (i.e. where we assume some bound on the total memory of the adversary).<br/>In this setting, we wish to achieve two tasks: secure positioning, and position-based key exchange. While the question of secure positioning has been asked in the past, no satisfactory answers exist. <br/><br/>The second question (of position-based key exchange) has not been asked in the past. We also ask a broader question: whether position-based Secure Multi-Party Computation can be achieved in this setting.

Science simulation software falls into two main categories, virtual laboratories and simulations of phenomena. Virtual laboratories simulate on-screen the experiments that are traditionally performed in real school laboratories as part of biology, chemistry and other science topics. They provide opportunities to use lab materials, equipment, and tools that are designed to mirror those in a real laboratory. Other simulations of science phenomena are used to model things that are not easily observed in real life or where a computer simulation offers other advantages. Simulations may be used to show students scientific phenomena that cannot easily be observed in real time. For example, seeing things in slow-motion (like the motion of a wave) or speeded-up (e.g., erosion caused by a river). Research-based evidence is critical to decision-making for leadership in these contexts, yet the research base is fragmented and there is limited current synthesis and/or meta-analysis is available. This study will fill that gap. For broader impact, the synthesis will provide a balanced consideration of the evidence from the field that is relevant to products available now. It is anticipated that this will be widely used by a variety of groups responsible for the science education of middle and high school students across the nation. The findings will be disseminated throughout the science education community and research community through journal articles, conference presentations and through the publication of a special Knowledge Brief that will be widely distributed.

The experience of Rio software developers provides a critical case of a local occupational community that is engaged in a global (and largely foreign) profession and is dependent on the daily access to the codified knowledge of the larger profession both for accomplishing its local technical tasks and for maintaining its status through its link with the larger global industry. The global aspirations, however, run into conflicts with local and national identities. The interviews will focus on those tensions and their effect on local recreation of technical knowledge. Fifty developers, recruited through a theory-driven snowball sample, will be interviewed in the spring and summer of 2007. Additionally, software development work will be observed in two organizations. The work combines three theoretical perspectives that have been recently used to understand professional knowledge and knowledge work, using the experience of Brazilian programmers as a tool to highlight the shortcomings of each approach and working towards a synthesis by looking at the interaction between the factors privileged by each of the accounts. The work considers a rational actor approach to individual investment in learning, a set of theories that stress identity and communities, and the networked economy framework that stresses global linkages. Each approach helps understand different aspects of modern professional knowledge: the often rational basis for individual investment into learning, the importance of shared meaning and membership, and the role of global links that tie together industrial clusters around the world. Integrating those approaches is important since each of them runs into serious problems when faced with a case where individual strategies, membership and global linkages are in clear interaction with each other. The experience of Rio software developers is exactly such a case, and thus provides for an exciting opportunity for comparing the three frameworks and making steps towards synthesizing them. The successful understanding of how the tensions experienced by Rio developers affect the local recreation of technical knowledge will contribute to our understanding of knowledge work in the context of global industries where the workers must often balance their allegiances to local and global networks. It will thus provide a deeper understanding of some of the fundamental assumptions that underlie the discussion of knowledge in development. The work would also be of specific interest to the Brazilian software development community itself as it strives to understand its place in the world. Such understanding would help the developers look for better ways of engaging with foreign technology.

This project is developing new methods to make such systems use their limited resources more efficiently, increasing performance, reducing costs and energy requirements. <br/><br/>Modern general-purpose computers (PCs, servers, etc.) owe most of their high processing speed to caches. These memory system components fetch data from the slow (but inexpensive) main memory for the fast processor before it even realizes it needs it. Unfortunately the performance offered by caches is very difficult to guarantee, greatly complicating the prediction of a program's worst-case performance. This prediction is essential for a broad class of embedded and control systems ? those with real-time requirements. Such systems must respond to inputs before a deadline elapses or else something will fail. Hence such systems must be over-provisioned to cover the ?margin of ignorance?, raising costs and energy requirements.<br/><br/>This project is developing methods to provide memory accesses as fast as with a cache, but without any of the timing uncertainty, making this technology suitable for real-time systems. The research team uses a unified approach which cuts across compilers, operating systems, and computer architecture to create a much more efficient solution than possible by considering the problems separately. The fundamental insight is that by limiting preemption among threads, one can reduce the total memory required, allowing more data to be stored in fast memory. This speeds thread execution, allowing further reduction of preemptions (and hence memory requirements) leading to a repeatable, virtuous cycle.
0703896	Studies of Alkali Metal and Low-z Superconductors under Extreme Hydrostatic Pressure	DMR	CONDENSED MATTER PHYSICS	08/15/2007	05/11/2010	James Schilling	MO	Washington University	Continuing grant	Daniele Finotello	01/31/2012	$525,000.00		jss@wuphys.wustl.edu	CAMPUS BOX 1054	Saint Louis	MO	631304862	3147474134	MPS	1710	9162, AMPP	$0.00	Technical: <br/>Alkali metals are canonical free-electron systems which, according to conventional wisdom, should become even more free-electron-like under pressure. It is, therefore, remarkable that theoretical work predicts that under strong compression the nearly free electrons in the alkali and alkaline earth metals should become markedly less free and begin to couple strongly with the lattice, leading to possible transformations to lower symmetry crystal structures and/or the appearance of superconductivity. Similar results are anticipated for the relatively simple beginning transition metals Sc, Y, and Lu which, as for the alkalis Li and Cs, show anomalous superconductivity under high compression. This project will study in depth to ultrahigh pressures the superconducting phase diagram and critical magnetic field behavior of selected alkali metals, their alloys and compounds, as well as in Sc, Y, and Lu. The systematics derived from this study should shed some light on the properties of hydrogen under pressure which has been predicted to become a metal at multi-Mbar pressures with possible superconductivity near room temperature. The proposed experiments give undergraduate and graduate students an excellent opportunity to both learn and develop important laboratory techniques and collaborate with groups both in the US and abroad.<br/><br/>Non-Technical:<br/>Solids which are not metallic may become metals if high pressures are applied to bring the atoms closer together, thus increasing the orbital overlap of the outer electrons. In the simplest picture, applying high pressures should turn insulators into metals or good metals into better ones. To the contrary, experiment shows that the simplest metals known, the alkali metals Li, Na, K, Rb, and Cs, become increasingly complex under very high pressures, with similar results for the alkaline earths like Ca, Sr, or Ba. Under sufficient pressure Cs even turns into a transition metal, like Ta or Nb, and becomes superconducting, as do Li and Ca at transition temperatures as high as 15-25 K. Understanding the changes under pressure in these relatively simple systems deepens our understanding of metals and superconductivity in general. These studies provide insight into a possible superconducting state near room temperature in metallic hydrogen under millions of atmospheres of pressure. The proposed experiments give undergraduate and graduate students the opportunity to learn and develop a multitude of essential experimental techniques; these students will also benefit from collaborations with groups both in the US and abroad.

The proposed approach combines ideas from social network analysis, Internet computing, distributed computing, and machine learning to solve problems in population biology. The diverse computational tasks of this project include design of algorithmic techniques to identify social entities such as a communities, leaders, and followers, and to use these structures to predict social response patterns to danger or disturbances. Nowhere is the impact of social structure likely to be greater than when species come in contact with predators. Thus, the accuracy and predictive power of the proposed computational tools will be tested by characterizing the social structure of horses and zebras (equids) both before and after human- or predator-induced perturbations to the social network. The proposed interdisciplinary research will have broader impacts on a wide range of research communities. New methods for analysis of social interactions in animal populations will be useful for behavioral biologists in such diverse fields as behavioral ecology, animal husbandry, conservation biology, and disease ecology. The machine learning algorithms that will be develop are relevant to many studies in which researchers need to classify temporal interaction data. The proposed network methods have broader relevance to human societies: disease transmission, dissemination of ideas, and social response to crises are all dynamic processes occurring via social networks. Further, through teaching and participation in outreach, students and school teachers will gain access to opportunities for hands-on, interdisciplinary experiences in a new area of computational biology. The research and software resulting from the proposed project will be disseminated both in computational and biological communities and enhanced by cross-disciplinary training activities and will serve to train a new generation of interdisciplinary scientists.
0722958	MRI: Acquisition of a Near-Field Optical Microscope with Spectroscopic Capabilities	DMR	MAJOR RESEARCH INSTRUMENTATION	09/01/2007	08/14/2007	Miriam Deutsch	OR	University of Oregon Eugene	Standard Grant	Charles E. Bouldin	08/31/2010	$324,675.00	Geraldine Richmond, William Roberts, Oksana Ostroverkhova	miriamd@uoregon.edu	5219 UNIVERSITY OF OREGON	Eugene	OR	974035219	5413465131	MPS	1189	9161, AMPP	$0.00	Technical Abstract<br/><br/>In this proposal we request funds to purchase a state-of-the-art optical system for performing Near-field Scanning Optical Microscopy (NSOM) with spectroscopic capabilities. The promise of NSOM lies in its ability to provide wavelength-dependent optical imaging in spatial regimes well below the diffraction limit; its imaging and spectroscopic capabilities offer structural and compositional information at a spatial resolution much higher than traditional optical microscopy. The NSOM therefore comprises a crucial bridge between optical diffraction-limited systems and higher-spatial-resolution non-spectroscopic techniques such as atomic force microscopy and electron microscopy. Characterization of materials in this spatial regime is of paramount importance as the shift from micro to nano continues. The system will be configured to ensure an immediate contribution to research programs based at the University of Oregon in fields ranging from nanophotonics to biological sciences. The NSOM capabilities will be exploited to extend ongoing research on coherent optical phenomena in highly confining metallodielectric nanostructures. The requested system is ideally suited for investigation of plasmon localization, nonlinear plasmonics active nanoplasmonic systems. As NSOM has also been shown to be of great usefulness in the characterization of organic and biological materials, it will be used by several research groups with interests in these fields. In one project, it will be used to investigate the spatial organization of ion channels at synaptic active zones in receptor cells. In a separate research group the NSOM will facilitate spectroscopic imaging of surface-adsorbed biomolecules at the submicron level. In another project, charge transport in photoconductive organic semiconductors will be investigated at the single molecule level. As part of the multi-user Surface Analytical Facility at the University of Oregon, the NSOM would be optimally positioned to impact a broad range of emerging research programs, both within the university and outside, as well as expand the current facility user base.<br/><br/><br/>Non-Technical Abstract<br/><br/>This proposal addresses the acquisition of a specialized high-resolution microscopy system, capable of providing information about the structural and compositional characteristics of minute structures. A large variety of systems may be studied with this instrument; some examples include very small metal particles , biological cells, light-emitting molecules and thin oil slicks on water surfaces. What unites all of these systems is their size scale -typically about one half of one thousandth the width of a human hair, and often even smaller than that. Conventional optical microscopes such as those in high school science labs cannot reveal spatial features of objects at such small size scales. This limitation is inherent to all commonly available optical systems which employ light and lenses for visualization and magnification of images. The smallest spatial feature which may be distinguished using these instruments is about one half the wavelength of visible light - approximately five to ten times larger than the systems we are interested in studying. However, if instead of a lens a minute aperture (even smaller than our smallest object!) is placed at very high proximity to the sample, imaging of much finer features is possible when the aperture is illuminated with visible light. Such a system will allow students and researchers at the University of Oregon and its affiliated Institutions to elucidate the characteristics of novel systems such as the smallest light emitting structures known to nature, fabricate ultra-compact electronic and optical devices, understand how chemical contaminants interact with their immediate environment, and study biological cell structure and functionality with unprecedented optical resolution.

The measurement of biological characteristics (biometrics) such as fingerprints and facial images provides a means of identification that neither needs to be carried nor remembered. Evaluation of biometrics has traditionally been focused on the ability of biometric systems to identify members from a population, e.g., for purposes of authentication. As these systems come into more widespread use, attempts will naturally be made to test and frustrate their ability to identify individuals. Understanding these attempts requires a fundamental new analytic approach, based on modeling the capabilities of an adversary with full generality. BIRT develops the adversary model using the information controlled by the adversary, e.g., for recognition, the clothing, glasses and makeup they wear. BIRT uses disinformation theory to abstractly model the adversary capabilities to mask their identity from an interested observer. Disinformation theory is inspired by Shannon's information theoretic model for communications systems, but views the ?noise source? as controlled by the adversary, abstractly modeling the capacity of the adversary to control the noise in the channel (for example, by transforming the image ?signal?) between the biometric sender being identified and the biometric system receiving the identifying information. Face recognition systems will be used to gain experience with and refine the disinformation theory models, with a variety of disguises used as disinformation sources.

The overarching science question is related to magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling, that is whether the ionosphere passively responds to the situation in the magnetosphere or whether the ionosphere should be considered as more tightly coupled to the magnetosphere so that it influences the whole magnetosphere-ionosphere response to the solar wind drivers. Specific science goals that will be addressed include 1) Quantifying the dawn-dusk asymmetry in the return flow including its variation with IMF clock angle; 2) Quantifying the asymmetry in intensity and latitude of particle precipitation and its relationship to: the return flow intensity, the Birkeland currents, and the IMF clock angle; 3) Determining whether inner magnetospheric convection including ring current physics can account for the observed distributions of flows and Birkeland currents or whether MHD physics without ion drift physics can account for the observed distribution of return flows. <br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this effort lies in significantly advancing our understanding of the storm-time Magnetosphere-Ionosphere system and the mid-latitude electrodynamics that occur during active times. This understanding is needed to advance the fundamental science understanding of geomagnetic storms but also has application to practical areas of importance such as communications and navigation for which strong ionospheric electric fields are of paramount concern. This project also continues an informal partnership between APL and the physics department at Augsburg College that consists in providing summer research opportunities for undergraduate students from Augsburg at APL via the JHU/APL Student Summer Internship program. M-I coupling during magnetic storms is one of the important physical processes that affect the upper atmospheric electrodynamics of the polar region. Thus, the research project will contribute to the larger research goals of the International Polar Year Program at NSF.

The current project is focused on refining, expanding, and testing these education innovations on a wider audience of faculty and students across the United States. It is also implementing the new materials, and in the process, creating diverse and portable modules for student projects and undergraduate research. More precisely, the project is developing faculty expertise by conducting workshops at the PI home institutions and at national meetings to train faculty to teach the course at their home institutions. Also, the PIs are recruiting participants from these workshops to develop project modules to be used by students as end of term projects or in undergraduate research. Moreover, the PIs are institutionalizing the course at their schools and are providing assistance to other interested institutions. The PIs are managing the development of a growing and self-sustaining network of faculty educators who teach and institutionalize the course, develop modules, and participate in the assessment of the role of the course in the curriculum.
0718523	Using the Multi-level, Integrated Database Approach (MIDA) to Reduce Non-Response Error and Contextualize Survey Analysis	SES	METHOD, MEASURE & STATS	09/01/2007	08/07/2007	Tom Smith	IL	National Opinion Research Center	Standard Grant	Cheryl L.

The multi-level, integrated database approach (MIDA) seeks to address and redress this problem. MIDA greatly enriches existing sample frames by a) extracting all possible information from the sample frame for use in data collection and analysis, b) augmenting the sample frame by linking in both case-level and aggregate-level data from a wide range of public databases, and c) further enhancing the data collection by recording for both respondents and non-respondents a large degree of paradata generated during the data-collection process itself. The data in the augmented sample frame can be used to a) assist in data collection by providing interviewers with more information about the target sample, b) assess non-response bias by comparing respondents and non-respondents on the extensive case-level and aggregate-level information known for all cases in the augmented sample frames, and c) contextualize analysis by using the same contextual data for analysis on the completed cases. This initial test of MIDA will draw a sample of 400 addresses from the National Opinion Research Center national sample frame and augment those cases with case-level and aggregate-level data from a wide range of public data sources. It will then assess the completeness and accuracy of the added information such as by crosschecking data across information sources.<br/><br/>Survey research is the most widely used tool for studying human populations, but the decline in response rates has raised the concern that the quality of data from surveys has been falling due to increased non-response bias. MIDA has the potential to a) improve response rates by providing interviewers with more useful information during data collection, b) better asses the level of non-response bias that exists in surveys and then develop appropriate weights to adjust for whatever bias is detected, and c) improve data analysis by making contextual, geographical data automatically available as part of every survey data file. MIDA should thus lead to a general improvement in scientific research from surveys.

Anti-virus and anti-spyware programs, personal firewalls,<br/>intrusion-detection tools, Java's stack inspection, and even mechanisms that trap operatingsystem<br/>exceptions in order to show a ?blue screen of death? can all be thought of as run-time<br/>monitors. Although they differ greatly in their complexity and scope of policies that they can<br/>enforce, these mechanisms all observe the behavior of a running system and detect and react<br/>to potentially dangerous events. Despite the pervasiveness and real-world importance of runtime<br/>monitors, their use has far outpaced theoretical work that makes it possible to rigorously<br/>reason about monitors and the policies that they enforce, particularly in distributed settings.<br/>This project develops models, tools, and mechanisms for reasoning about and implementing<br/>distributed, concurrently executing run-time monitors. The research adopts a holistic,<br/>four-prong approach that spans the breadth of the space between theoretical models and<br/>practical systems for enforcing run-time policies. Specifically, this project (1) creates a<br/>framework for reasoning about enforcement that permits the possibilities of concurrent, distributed<br/>computations; (2) develops a type-safe policy-specification language that ensures<br/>that specified policies compile into well-behaved monitoring mechanisms; (3) designs trustworthy<br/>algorithms for automatically translating a desired overall policy into node-specific<br/>policies that can be distributed and enforced throughout a network; and (4) designs, implements,<br/>and tests a prototype system for specifying and enforcing run-time policies with<br/>support for concurrently executing computations. Taken together, these research tasks enable<br/>formal modeling and automatic enforcement of run-time security policies in concurrent<br/>and distributed settings.

During their junior and senior years, students will be paid to conduct year-round independent research under the direction of a faculty mentor, and prepared for successful entry into graduate programs. Students will join the labs of faculty mentors who have experience in training under-represented minority students and who have funded grants from NSF BIO. Various mentoring and hands-on research activities have been designed to develop the student critical thinking and communication skills, including research seminars, courses on laboratory safety, ethics, and biostatistics, a workshop on principles and practice of biological research, a journal club, presentation of papers at local and national conferences, GRE preparation, and workshops on graduate school application process. The program's innovation derives from the use of the most current knowledge and experience in undergraduate research and mentoring, particularly those that have been found to effectively recruit and retain under-represented minorities in the science and research enterprise. The URM program will enhance the pool of highly qualified, under-represented minority individuals who will enter top-notch graduate programs in biology.

General information-theoretic considerations as well as experiments indicate that the main task of the olfactory bulb is to decorrelate odor stimuli. Its ability to do so depends sensitively on a match between the connectivity of the neural network and the odor environment. The project will focus on the ability of the bulbar neural network to adapt its connectivity to changing olfactory environments of the animal, while retaining the ability to discriminate and recognize significant previous odors. To model the plasticity of the network Hebbian long-term potentiation of the synapses will be included as well as the substantial neurogenesis that is an almost unique feature of the olfactory bulb. First the research will aim to establish biophysically plausible synaptic plasticity rules that enable the resulting network to decorrelate its odor inputs effectively. Then networks resulting from neurogenesis and cell death alone will be studied and their ability to decorrelate inputs will be assessed. Finally, synaptic and neurogenetic plasticity will be combined. It is expected that in the full model synaptic plasticity will provide fast fine-tuning of the adaptation within the connectivity framework set by neurogenesis, which in turn will retain significant information about past environments. Mathematically, the model will consist of a co-evolving bipartite network of weighted nodes and links. Computational and asymptotic solution methods will be developed to deal efficiently with the combination of discrete, stochastic evolution of the network structure and continuous deterministic evolution of its weights, involving three different time scales associated with neural activity, synaptic plasticity, and network connectivity, respectively.<br/><br/>A central function of the brain is to extract relevant features from the information it receives from the sensory organs and to make decisions based on new and previously stored information. The brain areas that perform the first information processing play an essential role by providing an internal representation of the environment that facilitates the extraction of relevant information. An important goal in neuroscience is to understand these internal representations and how they depend on the task at hand. In contrast to vision, where great progress has been made in understanding the neural encoding of the visual scenes that an animal is seeing in its natural environment, the processing of odor information in the olfactory system is much less understood. Unlike the visual world the olfactory world is high-dimensional and its characteristic features change significantly over time (seasons, migration, etc.). As the animal adapts to these changes the internal representation of a given odor is likely to change, as well. If this were the case the same rose would be perceived as smelling like one flower in spring and like another flower in fall, say, and the animal would have difficulties to identify odors. The goal of this project is to elucidate how the olfactory system copes with the conflicting tasks of adapting to changing environments and recognizing significant odors reliably in different environments. A central component of the model will be the substantial birth of new neurons (`neurogenesis') that is observed in the olfactory system throughout the life of the animal. The insights gained in this project are likely to be useful for the design of `artificial noses'. The project will also shed light on the role of neurogenesis in the hippocampus, where altered neurogenesis has been associated with mood disorders and neurodegenerative diseases.
0719544	Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant:   Referential Strategies in Northern Irish Restorative Justice Mediation	BCS	CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY	08/01/2007	08/09/2007	John Haviland	CA	University of California-San Diego	Standard Grant	Deborah Winslow	01/31/2009	$14,395.00		jhaviland@ucsd.edu	Office of Contract & Grant Admin	La Jolla	CA	920930621	8585344896	SBE	1390	1390, 9179, SMET	$0.00	Candler Hallman, supervised by Dr. John B. Haviland, will undertake research on the cultural and linguistic contextualization of  restorative justice during mediation in Northern Ireland.  As mediation is achieved through talk-in-interaction, it is hypothesized that linguistic person reference is an essential cultural and linguistic resource with which mediator-activists and participants contextualize restorative justice theory in Northern Ireland. More generally, the subtle ways in which mediation participants speak about one another, visible only through careful linguistic analysis, affect the outcome of mediation.  <br/><br/>Restorative justice is a model of criminal justice that seeks to engage the victim, the wrongdoer, and the affected community in repairing the harm caused by a crime.  Restorative justice  has evolved into a global social movement focused on building long-lasting peace in communities torn apart by violence. It was introduced into Northern Ireland in 1996.  Using linguistic anthropological theory, the researcher will investigate the micro-processes of  interaction in these mediations to understand how talking about  individuals and groups displays social relationships between current interlocutors as well as the person or persons referred to.  For example, he hypothesizes that the characterization of the participants, as well as the community to which restoration must occur is a collaborative achievement formulated from the theory of resotrative justice, local conventions of language use, and mediation by subtle interactive cues signaled between participants.  <br/><br/>Hallman will employ multiple ethnographic and linguistic research methods. He will use participant observation in the local communities in which the mediation sessions are held to record, contextualize, and anlyze ordinary conversation of a sample of mediators and offenders. He will tape mediation sessions involving a range of conflicts and persons to be analyzed using conversational analysis techniques. He will conduct  indepth interviews of participants and mediators. These data will be used to test  four overarching  hypotheses about linguistic practices, grammatical constructions, the use of language during the mediation process, and mediation outcomes.<br/><br/>The research is important because it will contribute to theory about how global social movements are contextualized through language practices at particular sites. The research will help to understand the successes and failures of post-conflict mediation. The project also will contribute to the education of a social scientist.
0719460	Doctoral Dissertation Research in Political Science: Achieving Post-War Peace: The Internal Politics of Colombia's Demilitarizing Rebel and Paramilitary Groups	SES	POLITICAL SCIENCE	09/01/2007	08/05/2007	Roger Petersen	MA	Massachusetts Institute of Technology	Standard Grant	Brian D. Humes	08/31/2008	$12,000.00		rpeters@mit.edu	77 MASSACHUSETTS AVE	Cambridge	MA	021394301	6172531000	SBE	1371	9179, SMET	$0.00	This project seeks to explain 1) why post-war armed organizations endure, go out of business or shift to a new sector (legal politics, crime) and 2) why ex-combatants either return to violence or successfully reintegrate into civilian life. 49% of civil wars, which ended between 1945-1999, erupted in subsequent war; 51% consolidated peace. To explain this variation, Political Science offers macro-level theories and micro-level empirics, but nothing in between. A major advance in the study of conflict and peace would come from filling this gap and theory building at the organizational level. This project attempts to construct such a theory. Additionally, it aims to develop a theory of post-war recruitment that treats post-conflict individuals not as independent agents, but as embedded in ex-combatant networks and groups which structure their decisions to demobilize. Last, it proposes to test this theory against hypotheses from the existing conflict literature that assumes semblance between pre and post war peace. To carry out this test, the study relies not on cross-national, but on original organizational, network, and individual level data.<br/>To build a theory of the post-war armed firm and its ex-combatant employees, this project analyzes the demilitarization of 48 paramilitary and rebel groups and 46,000 combatants in Colombia. It uses a multiple methods approach including in-depth interviews of experts on each armed group, ethnographic case studies of ex-combatant networks, and content analysis of armed organizations' records. Additionally, a large-scale individual-level survey of 500 demobilized individuals, 300 ex-combatants who have returned to arms, and 200 civilians will be conducted.<br/>This project affords social value in several ways. First, the project has the benefit of advancing knowledge of the causes of recurrent war, reintegration of ex-soldiers, and pacification of armed organizations and thus contributing to the development of demilitarization policy. Successful demilitarization of war-affected populations have proven vital to stabilizing post-conflict environments around the world, reducing the likelihood of renewed conflict, and facilitating countries' transitions from violence to peace, normalcy and reconstruction. Developing an understanding of how to achieve such success thus promises great benefits to society. Second, the study offers an additional benefit of developing intellectual collaboration and research partnerships between American and Colombian. Last, the results of this project will be disseminated broadly in the hope of informing policy in Colombia, the United States and other conflict zones.

Collagen is a naturally-occurring material which can impart specific biochemical and mechanical signals. While these features suggest that this biopolymer is a choice material for use in drug delivery and regenerative medicine, properties related to tensile strength and nanoscale structure can limit applicability. Furthermore, the synthetic design and production of collagen-based biopolymers has exhibited challenges not associated with other protein-based polymers, primarily because of the stringent need to correctly post-translationally modify the backbone for correct assembly, structure, and function. To address these limitations, this award will use a yeast expression system to create recombinant collagen-like biopolymers. Mechanical strength and structural properties will be modulated by incorporating natural cross-linkers of varying architectures. The proposed functional modifications upon this scaffold will expand the scope of material properties to include mechanical and structural ranges that are not naturally available.<br/><br/>The capability to create and investigate the fundamental properties of bioresponsive materials is critical for advancing areas such as regenerative medicine, therapies for disease, and biosensors. By creating novel collagen-like polymers of precise architectures using a yeast expression system, this award is planning to obtain mechanical and structural properties not naturally observed while simultaneously preserving collagen's natural ability to elicit biological responses. The project will involve both undergraduate and graduate students in the research. Due to the interdisciplinary nature of this collaboration, students participating in this research will gain an integrated perspective of the important interfaces and synergies between diverse fields. Results from this proposed work will also be incorporated into two graduate courses.
0710570	Materials World Network: Physically Based Approach for Predicting and Minimizing Damage Nucleation in Metals	DMR	METAL & METALLIC NANOSTRUCTURE, COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH	08/15/2007	02/08/2011	Thomas Bieler	MI	Michigan State University	Continuing grant	Eric Taleff	07/31/2011	$419,000.00	Martin Crimp	bieler@egr.msu.edu	Office of Sponsored Programs	East Lansing	MI	488242600	5173555040	MPS	1771, 7298	5936, 5980, 7488, 9162, AMPP	$0.00	The ability to predict damage nucleation and evaluate whether it will lead to a fatal flaw is one of the major goals of computational plasticity. However, most modeling of damage is based upon the assumption of pre-existing flaws or cracks, and the modeling approaches developed so far predict the growth rather than the nucleation of damage. While heterogeneous deformation is understood to be a precursor to damage nucleation, the step between heterogeneous deformation and damage nucleation is not clearly understood. If heterogeneous deformation is not modeled accurately, then it is unlikely that damage nucleation and subsequent damage growth can be confidently predicted. From a review of current understanding of heterogeneous deformation and deformation transfer at grain boundaries, identification of mechanisms of damage nucleation will require quantitative knowledge of (i) the orientations of crystals on either side of the interface, (ii) the boundary orientation and structure (energy), (iii) the activated deformation systems on either side of the boundary, and (iv) the stress-strain gradient history in the grains on either side of an interface. This research examines metals and alloys with simple microstructures that have an intrinsically low ductility (in this case titanium and dual phase steels) and thus provide the best opportunity to gain the slip-system-based information needed to clearly identify damage nucleation mechanisms. <br/><br/>The goals of this research program are: (1) Identify fundamental rules for identifying strong and weak boundaries in the context of a deformation path (2) Express rules quantitatively in the form of models that track boundary strength as a function of local stress and strain history. (3) Implement grain boundary strength rules into computational models of mesoscale deformation. This is accomplished in a joint research project involving Michigan State University (MSU) and Max Planck Institut fr Eisenforschung (MPIE) in Dsseldorf, Germany, where mutually useful skills are present which can reach the above goals when integrated into an international cooperative research program. The research is based upon obtaining sufficiently detailed data sets so that damage nucleation mechanisms in polycrystal boundaries can be clearly identified. State of the art methodologies are used, which permit comparisons of multiple experimental methodologies that provide complimentary information. Comparison of data sets helps quantify the resolution and credibility of orientation imaging microscopy, serial sectioning, three-dimensional x-ray mapping, electron channeling contrast imaging (ECCI) and backscattered electron imaging. These rich data sets facilitate model development that is needed before damage nucleation can be predicted with confidence in computational models. The work is carried out by three Ph.D. students under the guidance of Profs Bieler and Crimp at MSU, and Drs. Philip Eisenlohr and Franz Roters at the Max Planck Institut fr Eisenforschung. Extensive exchanges between the two laboratories occur in order to integrate experimental and analytical methods to reach these goals. Multi-scale modeling of sophisticated processing and service conditions of advanced materials and components is needed to support all technological innovations that drive the world economy. It is difficult to think of an aspect of material processing that affects society more than being able to reliably predict damage nucleation. Success in implementing credible models of damage nucleation in design environments will lead to reduced waste, accelerated time to market for highly value-added manufactured goods, improved safety and economy in all aspects of technology and engineering. <br/><br/>This award is co-funded with the Office of International Science and Engineering.

Specifically, the question asked is how much information a cell can obtain about chemical gradients and other signals released from the cells around it. The theoretical framework for this study is the mathematical theory of communication, known as information theory. Information theory, pioneered in the 1940's by Claude Shannon, provides the technical foundation for modern communications devices ranging from computers to cell phones. In this project, the investigators take the mathematical concepts developed in communications engineering and apply them to understanding a fundamental biological process known as signal transduction. <br/><br/>The human body is composed of trillions of individual cells. Different cells perform different functions, many of which depend on exchanging chemical signals with other cells. Some examples of communication between cells in the human body include communication between nerve cells in the brain, response of immune cells to chemical markers released by injured or infected tissue, and metastasis (uncontrolled growth and spread) of cancer cells. As with cellular telephones, communication between biological cells is limited by fundamental physical constraints that can be described by quantitative mathematical models. By improving our understanding of cell-to-cell communication and the physical constraints on its efficiency, the proposed project has the potential to improve our ability to understand a wide range of diseases involving breakdowns in cellular communications, such as cancer, chronic inflammation, and certain developmental defects.

Baerwald	01/31/2011	$460,368.00		vitousek@stanford.edu	3160 Porter Drive	Palo Alto	CA	943041212	6507232300	SBE	7304, 1691	1689, 1691, 9186, 9278, EGCH	$0.00	Agricultural systems offer substantial opportunities to integrate basic understanding of ecosystems and of human societies. Properties of ecosystems constrain the range of possible pathways for agricultural intensification, and the nature of agricultural production can influence aspects of human societies. At the same time, human societies create and develop specific systems of agricultural production that transform ecosystems, sometimes in dramatic ways. The Hawaiian Archipelago offers excellent opportunities to explore the nature and consequences of interactions among ecosystems, agricultural systems, and human societies as they played out over centuries prior to European contact. This collaborative research project will focus on intensive agriculture and society in Kohala, Hawai'i, where broad and well-defined environmental gradients encompass a large (60 km-square) and long-sustained rain-fed dryland agricultural system that was abandoned in the mid-19th century. With participation from local communities and schools, experimental gardens will be established across the range of the field system. This effort will draw on community input (traditional knowledge), archaeological observations, and ecosystem/soil analyses in addition to agricultural experimentation. Once in place, these gardens will be used to develop physiologically based agricultural crop models and to determine how the agricultural system was organized and integrated; how it was sustained for centuries prior to European contact; and how it interacted with nearby irrigated systems. This last effort will make use of strong differences in the abundances of multiple stable isotopes across the broad environmental gradient of Kohala.<br/><br/>The establishment of experimental gardens within the boundaries of the ancient and long-abandoned Kohala field system will serve several scientific and educational objectives. A well-validated crop model for dryland crops will allow much more detailed calculations of agricultural yields; these in turn will make existing models of past agricultural production and human demography across the Kohala landscape more realistic. Similarly, isotopic measurements of Hawaiian crops will support detailed interpretations of sources of food and other goods as these varied over space, time, and the social status of households in pre-contact Hawai'i. Together these efforts will make it possible to determine how this and other large, rain-fed agricultural systems functioned and how they interacted with nearby communities based on irrigated agriculture. The project therefore will contribute to understanding the evolution of complex societies. The gardens represent an extraordinary educational resource because they will make a step toward restoring an example of the main pre-contact agricultural system on the island of Hawai'i. School and community groups will make use of these gardens to learn science by conducting field experiments in a culturally meaningful setting. This project is supported by an award resulting from the NSF competition focusing on the Dynamics of Coupled Natural and Human Systems.

The investigators will conduct a global survey of relevant fossil species, using data from the published literature, existing field collections, new field collections, and museum specimens. Evolutionary history will be reconstructed using modern quantitative methods. Hypotheses about relationships will then be applied to a range of important questions in paleobiology, shedding light on subjects such as the nature of mass extinctions, biogeography, and rates of speciation. <br/><br/>Knowledge of evolutionary relationships is a basic requirement for understanding the history of life on Earth, yet modern quantitative methods have not always been applied to the study of fossil animals. The project seeks to redress this by using phylogenetic analysis to consider a diverse and important fossil group; further, this study will potentially serve as a model for the use of fossils to address major evolutionary questions. The project will train several students in evolutionary systematics, will serve public and K-12 education via a website and traveling museum exhibit, and will also serve the broader discipline by generating new data and also linking these data to existing biological databases.

Mathematical modeling and <br/>analysis can be used to give insight and better understand the dynamics of biological populations. Mathematical models are built on trade-offs between biological accuracy and mathematical tractability. Of particular importance are the effects on a population's dynamics of modeling assumptions concerning spatial or temporal heterogeneities or concerning heterogeneities among the characteristics of individuals within the population and how these characteristics affect the way they interact with their environment. The invited speakers will address a wide variety of theoretical issues, applications (ecological, epidemiological, etc.), and case studies that illustrate the connection of models with data. This meeting will develop understanding in new directions for the area of mathematical population biology that will have significant influence in years to come and will be of particular benefit for the young participants in this conference.

Shaka of University of California, Irvine and his graduate and undergraduate student colleagues will conduct exploratory research to develop isotagging reactions and multidimensional NMR methods in order to determine the primary structure of complex oligosaccharides. The ultimate aim of this research is to develop fast, sensitive, and robust methods for the determination of the primary structure in these important class of biologically active compounds.<br/><br/>Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) has become the primary tool for determining the structures of organic molecules. Despite this success, there are some classes of molecules that because of their chemical form do not lend themselves to NMR structure determination. Thus, new methods are called for. Prof. Shaka and his students will develop these methods to allow researchers to determine the nature and connectivity of complex polysaccharides -- molecules in which different sugars are connected together in complex ways. These molecules are biologically active, and are important in a number of biological contexts. In addition to the broader scientific impact of this work, the methods developed by Prof. Shaka and his students may be amenable for use in structure determination in other complex organic molecules. In addition, Prof. Shaka's students will receive advanced training in cutting edge NMR methods.

Smooth and efficient memory thermal management schemes must be developed to meet the challenge. There also lack memory thermal models and simulation tools in the public domain for research and education. This project proposes memory thermal models and thermal simulators for DRAM memory subsystems as well as efficient DTM (dynamic thermal management) methods. The investigators develop a simple and accurate dynamic thermal model based on fully buffered DIMM and an accurate and fast two-level simulator estimating the thermal behavior of a memory subsystem. They also study several new, system-level DTM schemes that coordinate DRAM thermal management with processor performance throttling. Several new DTM methods are to be developed. The first method, Adaptive Core Gating, adjusts the number of active cores according to the memory thermal status.<br/>The second method, Coordinated DVFS (dynamic voltage and frequency scaling), proactively scales down the processor frequency and voltage upon memory thermal emergency, reducing both the DRAM heat generation and the processor power consumption. Furthermore, thermal-aware OS job scheduling smoothes memory traffic and DRAM heat generation by mixing jobs with different memory demands appropriately. The thermal model is validated to execution on hardware platforms; and the proposed methods are evaluated on real systems.

To understand the evolutionary processes that led to key human features such as upright walking, a large brain, tool manufacture and use, and behavioral flexibility, it is necessary to develop a context for these innovations. What were the environmental forces that shaped and directed human evolution? Human evolution is a consequence of the interactions of early hominids with their physical and biological surroundings and there is a need to specifically reconstruct these parameters in association with discoveries of hominids. Documenting paleoenvironments at a relevant scale in the terrestrial record and developing causal links between evolution and environmental change, however, remains difficult. As a result, aspects of human evolution have been interpreted in the context of environmental data from the marine record, which provide a detailed record of large scale climatic change. This approach is valid only if links between global or regional phenomena and specific shifts in local hominid ecosystems can be demonstrated. <br/>This proposal seeks to address directly these issues by examining a series of environmental indicators to develop a high-resolution paleoenvironmental framework for a hominid-bearing sequence in the East African Rift Valley. This can then be linked to global climate changes. The work has at its focus a 2-3 million year old sedimentary sequence exposed in the Tugen Hills, a fault block within the rift valley near Lake Baringo in Kenya. This sequence exhibits abrupt and repeated cycling of major freshwater lake systems reflecting fluctuating climatic conditions. In recent research, this project has established a clear link between these short term oscillations (every 23 thousand yrs) and Milankovitch cycles that result from variations in the solar radiation received at the top of the atmosphere, controlled by variations in the geometry of the earth''s orbit. These changes represent the major driving force in the earth climate system through time, including glacial-interglacial cycles. Thirty-six vertebrate fossil localities, including three hominid sites, can be linked directly to this sequence, providing an opportunity to establish patterns of response by animals and vegetation to these short term shifts. <br/>This research represents the first attempt to develop multiple environmental and ecological indicators that can be linked directly to Milankovitch cycling in a terrestrial rift valley context. These data will be used to generate insights into the evolutionary response of hominid ecosystems to these pervasive climatic oscillations over the last six million years in Africa. While these data relate directly to fossil hominids and their vertebrate communities in the Baringo Basin, linking local ecological shifts with orbitally-forced patterns of insolation affords the prospect of extrapolating the affects of climatic oscillations on terrestrial ecosystems regionally in the past. With these data, we can begin to formulate high-resolution models for interpreting correlations between climate and human evolution, and elucidate the role of environmental change as a potential driving force in mammalian evolution in general and human evolution in particular. This research will foster highly interdisciplinary and collaborative studies, essential in developing perspectives of the multi-dimensional links between evolution and ecology. The project outlined here represents an ideal forum in which to generate and integrate research ideas cutting across traditionally disparate academic disciplines. The study will broaden opportunities and enable the participation of graduate students as well as research personnel from the National Museums of Kenya.
0724345	Collaborative Research: Assessing the Use of Paleorecords to Understand Beetle Outbreaks in Subalpine Forests	BCS	GEOGRAPHY AND SPATIAL SCIENCES	09/01/2007	05/29/2008	Kurt Kipfmueller	MN	University of Minnesota-Twin Cities	Continuing grant	Thomas J. Baerwald	05/31/2011	$111,210.00		kurt@umn.edu	200 OAK ST SE	Minneapolis	MN	554552070	6126245599	SBE	1352	1304, 1306, 9169, EGCH	$0.00	The last half-century has witnessed substantial alterations in the disturbance regimes of western forest ecosystems resulting from both changes in climate and human activities. While much attention is being focused on disturbances like fire and floods, eruptive bark beetle species have had equal or greater impact on western forest communities. Like all insects, bark beetles are highly sensitive to slight shifts in temperature, and recent warming trends may have resulted in increased outbreak frequency and range expansion into environments that were previously unoccupied by the beetles, such as high-elevation and high-latitude forests. Mountain pine beetle outbreaks are more common in lower elevation lodgepole pine forests but are thought to be relatively rare events in whitebark pine ecosystems. Outbreaks of mountain pine beetle in whitebark pine may be somewhat novel, with only a few documented outbreaks over the twentieth century. In recent years, however, mountain pine beetle outbreaks appear to be occurring more frequently in whitebark pine forests. The recent widespread appearance of mountain pine beetle in whitebark pine forests may be the result of changes to the life-cycle characteristics of mountain pine beetle or host susceptibility brought about by a warming climate. The long-term dynamics of mountain pine beetles in forests and the potential role of climate variability remains little understood because outbreaks are infrequent and historical records rarely extend beyond the twentieth century. This limits the number of events that can be examined and hinders the search for potential mechanisms producing outbreaks. This collaborative research project will increase the record of mountain pine beetle outbreaks in two watersheds using paleoecological reconstruction methods. The investigators will calibrate the historical record of mountain pine beetle outbreaks in common (e.g. lodgepole pine) and potentially novel (e.g. whitebark pine) forest ecosystems to extend outbreak histories further back in time by integrating dendrochronological techniques with lake sediment analyses. The use of these two paleoecological reconstruction methodologies takes advantage of the main strengths of each -- the annual resolution afforded by tree rings and the extraordinary depth of time that can be gleaned from lake sediments, which often exceed several thousand years. The investigators will develop detailed records of forest successional patterns following the most recent mountain pine beetle outbreaks using tree rings for comparison with longer records of vegetation and disturbance history available from pollen and insect remains found in lake sediments. Annually resolved reconstructions of summer temperature will be developed using tree-ring records from temperature sensitive trees to assess the role of climatic patterns related to bark beetle outbreaks. Records of successional patterns, climate variability, and beetle activity developed from tree rings will be compared with lake sediment records where the proxies overlap temporally to calibrate the sediment record and improve interpretations further into the past.<br/><br/>The results of this project will be relevant to management efforts in the forests where the study is conducted, and they will provide a number of longer-term benefits. First, the project will investigate the potential use of proxy records to reconstruct past mountain pine beetle outbreaks. Second, the project will provide a new method of pollen analysis that includes comparisons between instrumental and dendrochronological reconstructions of climate. The calibration of relationships between pollen and reconstructed climate from tree rings for approximately the last 1,000 years will strengthen inferences of climate conditions for periods of time for which instrumental and dendrochronological data are not available. Third, the results will be used to analyze forest successional dynamics following mountain pine beetle outbreaks and provide information regarding how vegetation composition may shift as a result of mountain pine beetle infestations. In addition to contributing to the science of beetle outbreaks, forest succession and climate controls, there will be direct management applications as a result of the research. The study will identify the linkages between mountain pine beetle outbreaks and summer climate conditions that can be used to better inform management personnel charged with developing plans for forest sustainability in the face of a changing climate. Whitebark pine is a keystone species in these ecosystems and is currently facing a number of threats including potential increases in mountain pine beetle activity. Understanding how climate, vegetation, and mountain pine beetles interact at long time scales will provide managers with critical information to develop management plans that could mitigate the deleterious impacts of a changing climate. The investigators will make the results accessible by working closely with resource managers throughout the study so that the managers are aware of the research as it progresses and can use significant findings in a timely manner.

The goal is to establish enough results so as to warrant the submission of a full proposal in 12 months.<br/><br/>In limited resource sharing systems, the degree of sharing between jobs is limited. An example is a time-sharing (processor-sharing) system, such as a CPU, where a fixed Multi-Programming-Limit (MPL) is imposed, so that only MPL number of jobs can share the CPU at a time.<br/>Another example is the classic M/G/k multiserver queueing system, with a fixed limit, k, on the number of servers.<br/><br/>Although such limited resource sharing systems are quite prevalent in computer systems and manufacturing systems, their analysis has stymied researchers for decades. This proposal makes a breakthrough in the analysis of such systems, by observing that the third moment of the job size distribution plays a critical role in their analysis -- a fact that has gone unnoticed all these years. The proposal seeks to understand this effect and find more accurate analyses of these important systems.<br/><br/>This proposal is a collaboration between two schools, Carnegie Mellon University and Georgia Institute of Technology, and thus a portion of the funds will be used to pay for travel between the two universities.

Her research will focus on their cognitive models of the human-environment relationship and how these models affect their practices of agriculture and logging. At the behest of international conservationists, the Bolivian government created Madidi National Park in 1995. Formation of this protected area, which stretches from the Andes to the Amazon Basin, enclosed numerous communities and continues to impact the everyday lives of those who live in and adjacent to the park. International NGOs have sought to strengthen their conservation efforts in part by influencing the values and beliefs of local residents so they become more concerned about impacts from their natural resource use. However, pilot research suggests that local residents already are mindful of environmental impacts, even though they conceptualize them differently than do the NGOs.<br/><br/>The three aims of the study are: 1) to assess and explain the formation of the environmental cultural models within a range of communities and ethnic groups; 2) to use this information to develop a survey to measure the value orientations and normative beliefs of the study population and their behavioral intentions towards logging, ranching, hunting, gathering, agriculture, and participation in conservation projects; and 3) to test the relationship between values, beliefs, and behavior and agreement within the study population about ideas and actions. This research will begin by delineating local ideas about the human-environment relationship and conservation through open-ended interviews, participant observation, and archival research. These qualitative data will be used to design and administer a culturally appropriate survey to determine the degree to which the value and belief systems are shared, adhered to, and acted upon.. The survey also will provide data for modeling local beliefs about the environment using cultural consensus analysis and standard psychometrics. <br/><br/>The results of this research will advance theory in cognitive anthropology and social psychology while also contributing to the growing body of work on environmental perceptions in political ecology. In addition, better understanding of these ideas and behaviors can ameliorate interactions between NGOs, the Bolivian government, and the individuals living in this continuously contested region. The research also will contribute significantly to the education of a social scientist.

Spengler	07/31/2010	$449,962.00	Richard Karp	ehalperin@cs.ucla.edu	1947 CENTER ST STE 600	Berkeley	CA	947044115	5106662900	CSE	7364	7364, 9216, HPCC	$0.00	In order to understand the genetic factors underlying complex diseases, disease association studies are performed, where cases and controls are collected and their DNA variants (SNPs) are compared. One of the main growing concerns in disease association studies is that population substructure may raise spurious discoveries, especially with the recent advances in technology where thousands of individuals are genotyped over the whole genome. In particular, if the cases and controls are collected from populations with different ethnic composition, the differences between the SNP variations in the two groups may be due to the population structure and not due to the disease. The main goal of this project is to develop efficient and accurate tools for population stratification methods, under different scenarios, and to integrate those tools in case control studies. The existing methods are either too slow or do not accurately predict the population substructure, and they lack rigorous analysis that proves their correctness. The new algorithms will consider cases in which the population is a collection of populations, populations in which individuals may have a mixed ancestry and use haplotype correlations to improve the algorithms. The impact of this proposed project stems from the fact that many current results reported in association studies are spurious due to population substructure, resulting in an incorrect understanding of the biological mechanisms causing a disease. The algorithms developed in this project will help to avoid such spurious results, thus improving our understanding of human biology and disease. The project involves the training of a graduate student and six summer students. The collaborative nature of the project will expose the students to the medical and genetics worlds, and at the same, it will improve their abilities to design and implement complex algorithmic problems. The software developed in this project will be integrated with the existing publicly available webserver HAP, which was developed by the PIs and has been used more than 9000 by geneticists worldwide.

The methods and techniques will be combined into the remote-access SNe Ia computational pipeline, which comprises sophisticated 3D simulation algorithms for fluid dynamics, nucleosynthesis, and radiation transport, as well as tools for the 3D analysis of SNe Ia data. SNe Ia are crucial for identifying the nature of dark energy, one of the most important problems facing modern science, because they serve as one of the most direct and precise distance indicators in the Universe. The results of this study will improve the cosmological calibration of these critical tools, by trying to understand what affects their status as standard candles, notably the different types of progenitor systems, deviations from spherical symmetry, and interaction with circumstellar matter. One important outcome will be a comprehensive set of observationally verified first-principles multidimensional explosion models of SNe Ia. Identifying physical correlations among predicted and observed signatures of SNe Ia will be crucial for improving the accuracy of their calibration.<br/><br/>This work is an exceptional platform for introducing students to cross-disciplinary and multi-field science, through the many areas involved in studying SNe Ia, such as numerical methods, large-scale hydrodynamics and radiation transport simulations, observations, and cosmological applications. Research results will be made available to the broad scientific community via the developed computational pipeline, and will be disseminated to the wider non-technical audience. The results will also benefit current and future ground- and space-based observing programs.
0718153	Interdisciplinary Study of the Striatum in Human Learning and Decision Making	BCS	COGNEURO, Science of Learning Activities	09/01/2007	07/29/2009	Mark Gluck	NJ	Rutgers University Newark	Continuing grant	Lynne Bernstein	12/31/2011	$561,233.00	Catherine Myers, Mauricio Delgado	gluck@pavlov.rutgers.edu	Blumenthal Hall, Suite 206	Newark	NJ	071021896	9739720283	SBE	1699, 7704	0000, 1699, 9178, 9251, OTHR, SMET	$0.00	The association of rewards with specific actions is a common learning mechanism observed in day to day life that lead to predictions about potential rewards and shaping of behaviors. Over the years, research has suggested that one particular brain structure, the striatum, is a central region involved in how humans learn what decisions are advantageous (e.g., lead to reward). The goal of this proposal is to explore the neural substrates of human reward learning and decision-making processes drawing on two distinct methodologies in cognitive neuroscience: functional neuroimaging and experimental neuropsychology. Functional neuroimaging in healthy individuals can show whether a brain region is normally involved in a cognitive function; neuropsychological studies of individuals with damage localized to the same brain region can show whether or not that region is also necessary for that function. With support from the National Science Foundation, Drs. Mark Gluck, Mauricio Delgado and colleagues at Rutgers University propose to integrate both methodologies to investigate the role of the human striatum during (1) learning when reinforcement is directly contingent on actions as opposed to learning from passive observation, (2) learning when there is a delay between action and reinforcement. Parallel studies will be conducted in patients with striatal dysfunction due to lack of dopaminergic input that occurs in Parkinson's disease (PD) and neuroimaging studies of striatal function in healthy subjects.<br/><br/>Results from this research will contribute to a deeper understanding of the role of the striatum in decision making and in reward prediction, and of how the striatum, and related brain regions, utilize prediction-error feedback. This research builds on prior studies of the role of the basal ganglia in feedback learning, but also expands into new and more complex cognitive domains, including the creation of chains of linked predictions about sequences of actions. Learning to predict future rewards and other positive outcomes is fundamental to our survival in a complex, dynamic and uncertain world; it provides essential knowledge for making decisions that critically affect our lives, and the lives of those around us. The findings could influence interdisciplinary research in economics and neuroscience concerned about the mechanisms of how humans make decisions. Further, the research will give us a deeper understanding of the non-motoric, more motivational deficits associated with PD, eliciting new ideas for future research directions. Finally, the proposal aims to increase training opportunities for undergraduate, graduate and post-doctoral trainees in both neuropsychology and functional neuroimaging.

Particles are also released into the environment from emission sources such as municipal waste incinerators, hazardous waste incinerators, welding systems, automobiles, diesel engine and aircraft exhausts, smelters, and utility boilers. There is also concern that nano-sized particles may be more harmful to human health than those in larger size ranges. Both the characterization and mitigation of particles is, therefore, a very topical area of environmental research. Research: Because of the importance in both understanding the adverse effects of particles and exploiting their features for beneficial purposes, aerosol research has been selected as one of four focal research areas (i.e., aerosol science and engineering; engineered aquatic processes; multi-scale modeling and molecular transformation engineering; and metabolic engineering and system biology) in the newly organized department of Energy, Environmental and Chemical Engineering (EECE), Washington University in St. Louis. Four core faculty members (i.e., PI and Co-PIs of this proposal) in EECE are heavily involved in particle-related research. To advance the knowledge and to develop the technology related to particles it is essential to characterize the size and composition distributions of particles. While there is extensive aerosol sampling and characterization instrumentation on campus, there is a glaring gap in the ability to simultaneously measure particle size and composition distributions in real time. The PIs, therefore, proposed the acquisition of high-resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer (HR-ToF-AMS) from Aerodyne Research Inc. The objectives of this proposed instrumentation acquisition project are: (1) to develop the capacity for real-time, simultaneous measurement of particle size and composition distributions; (2) to further advance particle related research activities at Washington University in St. Louis and research institutes in the surrounding area; and (3) to support the student training and education on the particle characterization at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. <br/><br/>Broader Impact The acquisition of HR-ToF-AMS will have significant impact on particle related research and education at Washington University by improving chemical analysis capabilities in the growth areas of aerosol science, environmental engineering and materials science. Acquisition of the instrument will advance the infrastructure for multidisciplinary research <br/><br/>activities by strengthening the facilities of the EECE and Center for Materials Innovation. The instrument will be used by faculty to advance scientific understanding in their respective disciplines of aerosol science and technology, environmental engineering, and materials science. The results of research using the instrument will have many societal benefits. The knowledge gained from environmental science and engineering research can provide a scientific basis for improved environmental protection. Improved understanding of nano-structured materials will benefit society when these novel materials are deployed in environmental, biomedical, and information technology applications. Meanwhile, the proposed instrument will be integrated into the curriculum of Aerosol Science and Technology for the senior undergraduate and graduate education. It will also strengthen the core courses for undergraduate Nanotechnology minor via hands-on or demonstration experiments. The inclusion of HR-ToF-AMS will enhance the teaching quality of the courses offered by these educational programs, and produce competent and creative workforce students for the societies. The PIs will actively present the research and education opportunity to underrepresented groups by approaching related student associations, and will recruit those interested to advance their careers in particle technology. Undergraduate students from other universities will have opportunities to experience this state-of-art instrument through the NSF-funded REU programs.

Current advances in SHM systems have lead to a variety of techniques capable of identifying damage; however, few strategies exist for using this information to quickly react to the environmental or material conditions to repair or protect the system. Unlike these modern SHM systems, biological systems can not only detect the presence of damage but react to heal it through stimulus responsive behavior. This research plan focuses on the use of advanced composite materials to mimic the response of biological systems to damage. This effort will provide a bridge between structural health monitoring and autonomic structural materials such that the SHM system can detect and respond to damage in a controlled fashion. Existing healing techniques are problematic because they cannot be controlled and provide no sensing response to report the presence of damage, the initiation of healing, or the strength recovered. A unique combination of materials and sensors will be used to mimic the one of the toughening responses exhibited by bone when subjected to cracking. The autonomous system developed here will use optical fibers to sense the presence of damage and autonomously initiate healing. Responsive behavior will occur by using the energy released from the optical fiber in the presence of damage as stimulus and the recent advances in thermally activated shape memory polymers (SMPs).<br/><br/>The outcome of the research will be a material system that can sense the presence of damage, arrest its propagation and initiate controlled healing through stimulus. The work will 1) model and characterize recently developed reactive polymers, 2) characterize the crack blunting from a localized modulus change at the crack tip, and 3) use cyberengineering to fabricate a composite material with integrated sensor networks, computing and logic to allow the system to respond to damage without human intervention. The research program will advance SHM from damage detection to an integrated material system which can identify and react to damage in an autonomous manner as biological systems do.

Examples of such problems can be found in a diverse range of areas, for example, in hardware and software design and verification, planning and scheduling, and artificial intelligence (AI). Many such problems can be translated into a common representation, called the Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) formulation. This formulation consists of a set of Boolean (True/False) variables and logical constraints among these variables. The challenge is to find an assignment to the variables such that all constraints are satisfied. In recent years, we have seen tremendous progress in the development of SAT solvers, which search for satisfying assignments. Current SAT solvers handle problem instances with over one million variables and several millions of constraints. An intriguing research question is whether the advances in SAT technology can be exploited for other key reasoning tasks central to AI. <br/><br/>This project considers three such tasks: (1) quantified Boolean reasoning, key in multi-agent reasoning and reasoning in adversarial settings, (2) counting of the number of satisfying assignments, which has many applications in probabilistic inference, and (3) sampling from the set of satisfying assignments, which is closely related to model counting. The broader impact of the proposal will be the design and development of efficient solvers for quantified Boolean formulas (QBF) and algorithms for model counting and sampling applicable to a wide range of users working in areas as diverse as verification, planning, adversarial reasoning, and probabilistic reasoning.<br/>

Our vision is that costly geochemical tools, such as the CAMECA ims 1270 ion microprobe, should be a community resource supported in centers with the scientific and technical expertise needed to fully exploit their potential. Prior NSF support has led to numerous significant discoveries in fields ranging from tectonics and igneous processes to sedimentology, paleoclimatology and paleobiology, the earliest history of the Earth and the origin and early evolution of the Solar System. In the current grant period, our goal is to ensure that the nation's geochemists, cosmochemists, and geochronologists continue to have access to our world-leading facilities at a level commensurate with our historic productivity, provide UCLA scientists the resources to continue to develop and refine existing and new SIMS methods for research in geochemistry, cosmochemistry, and geochronology, and undertake instrument modifications that lead to improvements in data acquisition and expanded capabilities that facilitate new types of investigations. Research training will continue to be a high priority and UCLA scientists will engage in synergistic activities both locally and nationally, including professional programs and K-12 education and outreach.

The instrument will be equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) system for microanalysis, and an electron back-scatter detector (EBSD) to obtain diffraction patterns of the sample. This combination of capabilities will enable research projects in<br/>materials science, engineering and earth and planetary sciences. Faculty in Chemical Engineering will study advanced catalysts for energy conversion and pollution control, durable fuel cells and defect free Ge/Si for low cost photovoltaics. Other projects include novel microfluidic devices, ion channels with potential use in DNA sequencing, cell-surface interactions in bio-films and aerosol derived particles for drug delivery. Faculty in Electrical Engineering will use the instrument for increasing efficiency of lasers and IR detectors and to make advances in epitaxial growth of lattice-mismatched materials. Faculty in Mechanical and Civil engineering will help improve understanding of scale effects on mechanical properties, particularly at the nanoscale and enable research on mechanics of grain boundary sliding and photonic band gap materials as sensors to detect damage in critical facilities. The FIB is an enabling technology to study thin sections of complex geological samples. Research by Faculty in Earth and Planetary Sciences includes studies of deformation and metamorphism in high pressure metamorphic rocks formed during continental collisions and the nature of fluid/rock interactions in the Earth's upper mantle. This research is essential for understanding the geochemical interactions between crust and mantle. Detailed studies of magnetic carriers in rocks will improve the university's ability to understand the paleomagnetic record that is essential for constraining the tectonic evolution of complex geologic terrains around the world. Finally, the FIB will revolutionize the ability to study sitespecific regions of the earliest solids formed in the solar system found in carbonaceous chondrites and cometary particles returned by the NASA STARDUST mission. Such rare and valuable samples must be characterized structurally, chemically and isotopically by integrated high spatial resolution techniques such as FIB-SEM, ion microprobe and TEM to elucidate their complex formational and thermal histories.<br/><br/>Broader Impact<br/><br/>There is tremendous need for this fabrication and analysis tool at UNM and open access to such a piece of high-tech equipment is necessary to foster the growth of science and technology in the state of New Mexico. Faculty from five departments at UNM and from at least two other New Mexico institutions will participate in this project. The faculty participants range from early career assistant professors to established senior faculty. Since UNM is a Hispanic Serving Institution, significant numbers of students<br/>from underrepresented groups will benefit from this facility. Graduate students, undergraduate students as well as post-docs will get hands-on access to this instrument. The project expects to have approximately 50 regular users for this instrument, after it becomes fully operational. They will integrate the research into their academic programs through new course development. By using this facility for outreach and demonstrations, they will also reach a broad cross section of students (K-12). The instrument will be<br/>located in the Electron Microbeam Analysis Facility in the basement of the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences. This building houses the Geology and Meteorite Museums; both facilities attract large numbers of tours from schools in the greater Albuquerque area as well as further a field. They plan to expand use of their suite of analytical instruments for demonstrations aimed at open house and recruiting events, helping them take the excitement of nanofabrication to the lay public. The FIB is particularly suited to demonstrate our abilities to perform nanoscale machining, with real time imaging. This facility will also help convert research ideas into commercial products, by providing access to small start-up companies in New Mexico and elsewhere.

The research is in two general areas, both involving ion formation by electrospray ionization (ESI) and mass analysis by Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT/ICR MS). The first area is investigating amino acid structures and how both water molecules and metal ions affect these structures. The structures are investigated using infrared (IR) spectroscopy and blackbody infrared radiative dissociation (BIRD). The main goal of these studies is to determine how many water molecules are needed for amino acids to change from nonzwitterion structures (most common in the gas phase) to zwitterion structures (most common in aqueous solution) and how interactions with metal ions influence this structural change. The second area is investigating how ions influence the organization of water itself. These experiments use IR spectroscopy to probe the structures of ions in size-selected nanodrops to determine effects of ion solvation at both short and long distance. The PI has already conducted studies on solvated calcium, sulfate and some simple amino acids. The renewed research project extends such studies to more complex amino acids (arginine, lysine), and more extensively solvated species and will use a broader IR spectral range than was possible previously. Taken together, these experiments should provide a better understanding of how heteroatoms in amino acid side chains and water molecules solvate charge in proteinaceous environments. They also should provide information about how water and the dehydration process in ESI affects ion structure. <br/><br/>Mass spectrometry plays an ever increasing role in analytical science, and the proposed research will educate and train scientists in this growing field, which is extensively applied in biology, medicine, and biotechnology research. In addition, this fundamental research on the building blocks of proteins will enable researchers to sequence proteins more rapidly and accurately.

This team will complete and characterize two multi-band optical and infrared cluster surveys, the IRAC Shallow Cluster Survey (ISCS), using the Spitzer Space Telescope, and the Blanco Cosmology Survey (BCS), using the Blanco 4m telescope in Chile. The BCS will be used to measure the galaxy power spectrum with 3.5 million galaxies extending to redshifts greater than one. These new programs will be coordinated with current and forthcoming millimeter-wave surveys designed to find clusters using the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect. Future surveys intended to deliver constraints on the dark energy equation of state will invariably be limited by systematic rather than statistical uncertainties. The ISCS and BCS will clarify and quantify these systematic effects, while simultaneously obtaining new, near-term cosmological constraints. The work uses catalog and cluster simulations to estimate precisely the survey completeness and contamination, and the cluster mass estimate accuracy. It also focuses on fields with optical/infrared and mm-wave data, now or soon, and with some existing X-ray data. The multi-wavelength approach enables a cross-calibration of the leading cluster selection methods, the possibility of developing cleaner and more sensitive selection techniques, and direct tests of the selection models.<br/><br/>This project will significantly impact larger experiments under way and to come. Because the BCS will constitute the largest contiguous deep optical survey in the southern hemisphere, the resulting public data set will be of great value for numerous other applications, such as galaxy evolution studies. This team has a record of working with K-12 teachers and students, and will expand that work in conjunction with the present research.

Comparative studies of the structure of primate skulls and teeth, field studies on dietary selection and foraging behaviors, and laboratory studies on the dynamics of feeding in captive primates have all contributed significantly to this endeavor. However, these research programs have never been fully integrated, and assumptions inherent to each limit the strength of hypotheses linking diet and feeding to primate biology and adaptations. For example, an assumption of lab research is that feeding behaviors and jaw-muscle activity recorded in the lab accurately reflect those of wild primates feeding in their natural habitats. Likewise, when applying field work to questions about the evolution of primate feeding, it must be assumed that field observations are related to masticatory function as observed in the lab.<br/><br/>The goal of this study is to integrate multiple lab and field methods into a study of foraging in free-ranging mantled howling monkeys at Hacienda La Pacifica, Costa Rica. First, using new technology designed specifically for this project, electromyographic data will be recorded from their jaw muscles while these animals feed in their natural habitat. Second, the mechanical properties of the foods consumed during the recording period will be quantified. Third, tooth wear will be quantified immediately prior to and following the recording period. Finally, feeding and ranging behaviors of individuals will be collected during the recording period. <br/><br/>Data from this study will be used to demonstrate how primates use their jaw-muscles during feeding on their natural foods and to generate ecologically relevant hypotheses relating jaw-muscle function to jaw structure. The jaw-muscle activity data will also be correlated with food mechanical properties, feeding behaviors and the progression of tooth wear. More generally, the proposed research will be the first of its kind to combine lab-based techniques for recording jaw-muscle function with field research on primate feeding ecology, behavior and dental morphology. Moreover, the integrative nature of this project will identify additional links between adaptations and function in the primate feeding apparatus, feeding behavior and diet that may not be evident from any one independent research program. <br/><br/>Broader impacts of this study include the promotion of collaboration between scientists at four universities with different areas of expertise and the training of students through their active participation in research for this project. The integrative approach will provide these students with hands-on training in field techniques, electromyography, and mechanical properties and behavioral data collection and analysis. It is also expected that information on mantled howling monkey feeding behaviors will benefit conservation management decisions regarding the long-term sustainability of these primates and their habitats in Central and South America. Finally, this project is led by a minority female researcher, thereby contributing to minority representation in the sciences.
0727023	Collaborative Research: Numerical modeling of fluid flow and transport during out of sequence thrusting and underplating: Application to the NanTroSEIZE investigation area	OCE	OCEAN DRILLING PROGRAM	08/01/2007	08/01/2007	Elizabeth Screaton	FL	University of Florida	Standard Grant	Thomas Janecek	07/31/2011	$122,446.00		screaton@ufl.edu	1 UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA	GAINESVILLE	FL	326112002	3523923516	GEO	5720	0000, OTHR	$0.00	Understanding the interplay between out-of-sequence thrusts, fluid expulsion, underplating, and the behavior of the plate boundary fault is of fundamental importance to the Nankai Trough Seismogenic Zone Experiment (NanTroSEIZE), but these processes have not previously been examined through fluid flow and deformation modeling. Accordingly, this modeling study will address the impact of these major processes on pore pressures and fluid flow within the prism, mega-splay fault, and plate boundary fault. The modeling will be implemented using an existing software package ABAQUS. This package offers the ability to simulate the major features important to this modeling, will allow modeling results to be reproducible by other researchers, and is flexible enough to accommodate needs of future subduction zone modeling.<br/>The model will be applied to the Kii transect of the Nankai subduction zone and used to test the following interrelated hypotheses:<br/>Hypothesis 1: The mega-splay fault system significantly alters the patterns of excess pore pressures and porosity loss within the accretionary complex.<br/>Hypothesis 2: The hydrologic role of the Nankai mega-splay system can be illuminated through observation of pore pressures, porosities, and fluid chemistry.<br/>Hypothesis 3: Underplating rejuvenates fluid expulsion at the base of the accretionary prism by transferring sediments to a different stress state and by moving the decollement zone to a less dewatered area.<br/>Although this application of the modeling is to the Kii transect of the Nankai subduction complex, an assessment of the importance of underplating and out-of-sequence thrusting for subduction zone dewatering and deformation will be useful for other subduction zones, as well as for workers in fold and thrust belts. Splay faulting and underplating are commonly inferred features that could greatly alter pore pressure and porosity distributions (and thus seismogenesis) in many subduction zones.<br/><br/>Broader Impact<br/>Understanding seismogenic zone processes has great societal impact related to earthquake and tsunami hazards. This study will constitute an initial step in the long-term investigation of the seismogenic zone. Modeling conducted early in the investigative process can help to shape scientific strategies during drilling and monitoring. The use of the ABAQUS software package will expand the ability of the subduction zone modeling community. Model input data sets will be made available to other researchers. As an active proponent in NanTroSEIZE, Liz Screaton will directly communicate modeling results to fellow proponents and at future workshops and NanTroSEIZE-related meetings. In addition, general interest conclusions will be published in scientific journals and presented at national scientific meetings. This project will result in the training of graduate students. At University of Florida, it will be adapted to either one PhD or two M.S. students. At University of Colorado, the project work will involve a student (either MS or PhD) in the modeling. The graduate students will present at scientific meetings and the project will be a significant component of their dissertation or thesis.

These instruments will become part of the university's Stable Isotope Ratio Facility for Environmental Research (SIRFER). Natural variations in the stable isotope abundances of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur are used to study biological, ecological, hydrological, and geochemical problems at and near the Earth's surface; these analyses are applied as well to human-related research from anthropology through forensic sciences. Current research projects include: Determination of isotope turnover times in animal tissues, leading to understanding metabolic routing and dietary histories of wildlife; Forensics applications determining the origins of unidentified humans; Reconstructing the migration routes of whales through their dietary inputs; Metabolism of toxins; Cycling of carbon within ecosystems; Estimates of stress responses in plants at the stand level; Reconstructing climate through tree rings; Determination of precipitation inputs relative to evaporative losses in river systems; Determination of nitrogen input sources and nitrogen transformation in rivers; and, in urban environments, Understanding both nitrogen deposition and partitioning of carbon dioxide sources from fossil fuels used in energy production versus biogenic activities. <br/><br/>In addition to valuable ecological research, this mass spectrometer will be used for undergraduate research and education, including the course, Stable Isotopes in Ecosystems. There is also an annual short course in Stable Isotope Ecology for students and faculty from other universities. Many of the students trained in these courses have gone on to establish their own stable isotope laboratories at other universities.

Efforts in this project will focus on model development and experimental verification of impact models between a robotic system and a deformable surface. These models will be included in new control designs to enable a robot to rapidly transition from non-contact to contact with a human tissue phantom. Unlike discontinuous and infinitely rigid ?hard-on-hard? impact models developed for manufacturing applications, the continuous impact models in this project will target impact of a robot with deformable tissue. As a result new continuous controllers can be developed that include the impact dynamics in the control design. The experiments proposed in this project will be used to support the idea of imparting controlled impact forces. The scientific outcomes of the SGER and subsequent efforts will provide an inroad to new applications where humans and robots share a common working envelope where contact is beneficial.

This project will focus on the agency of immigrant workers in overcoming challenges and establishing themselves as workers and members of households and communities in the U.S. Gomberg's ethnography is a micro-level look at how Mexican immigrant workers create and use social networks, attain resources, combat economic insecurity, nurture dignity and self-esteem, and promote norms that cultivate and help sustain markets for their labor. This study will complement existing research which has focused on the structural conditions that encumber immigrants, by showing how immigrants themselves react and adapt to these conditions. <br/><br/>The focus of this ethnography is a cohort of Mexican immigrants who work in the service/hospitality industry on Chicago's south side. Research will involve ethnographic interviews and participant observation that will take place at jobsites, households, and in the larger south-side immigrant community, as well as in the home communities in Mexico.<br/><br/>As globalization continues to generate international migrations and immigration is increasingly a critical issue for policy, Wali and Gomberg hope to make a timely contribution to both scholarly and policy debates. This project will localize these broad debates, demonstrating how Mexican workers in Chicago confront, change, and manage the circumstances of their lives as immigrants in the U.S. The research also will contribute significantly to the education of a social scientist.

Natural processes can produce extremely tiny, highly organized structures that are less than 1000 times the thickness of a human hair, yet lead to remarkable properties. Humans are doing their best to learn how to mimic nature. The ability to accurately and consistently create objects on this scale is predicted to revolutionize medicine, electronics, manufacturing, building materials, and even fashion. We are proposing the acquisition of a scanning electron microscope that will magnify objects by up to 10,000 times, allowing us to see some of these important structural details. This microscope fits on a standard tabletop, can be operated with minimal training, and has few maintenance requirements. It is ideal for use in undergraduate research at community colleges, which are attended nationally by nearly 44% of science and engineering graduates. It will be used in many divisions of science and technology, including the development of efficient methods for creating biosensors applicable to human health issues such as diabetes management. A second project will explore new methods for producing tiny metal particles that will increase the efficiency of important chemical conversions. A third project will examine the structures that influence the properties of gem-quality pearls. Outreach projects in biology and electrical and computer engineering technology will also be developed for local students and teachers in grades 7-12. The electron microscope is integral to all of this work because it can reveal the structural origin of the useful properties of synthetic and natural materials. Further, the hands-on experiences made possible with this instrument are expected to inspire more students to enter and remain in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields.<br/><br/><br/>Technical abstract<br/>We are proposing the acquisition of a benchtop scanning electron microscope (SEM) and sputter coater. These instruments will be used by several investigators for research and teaching in chemistry, geology, biology, and electrical and computer engineering technology (ECET). The first project explores the influence of molecular structure and reaction conditions on the nanoscale morphology of the conducting polymer polyaniline and its ring-substituted derivatives. Using these materials, we will develop a one-pot method to fabricate an enzyme-based biosensor composed of a conductive polymer matrix with embedded metal nanoparticles. Glucose/glucose oxidase is our preliminary target, but we will extend this work to other enzyme-substrate systems. The second project is the novel synthesis of biodegradable polysilyl esters catalyzed by the formation of metal nanoparticles. Dispersible, polymer-stabilized palladium nanoparticles are also being investigated as catalysts in the chemo-selective reduction of conjugate double bonds. The third project will characterize the gemological nature of pearls sold in the New York gem trade, including features such as color, luster, surface perfection, sphericity, etc. These are related to the pearls' microstructure, which is easily investigated by microscopy and whose origin depends on variations in the amounts of mineral matter (aragonite and calcite), organic material (the protein conchiolin), and water. Ready access to SEM will allow us to optimize reaction conditions to produce nanostructures with useful properties and will uncover the physiochemical origin of macroscopic properties in naturally occurring materials. This particular electron microscope requires minimal training to operate and has few maintenance and facilities needs, making it ideal for undergraduate research in nanoscience/technology at a community college, as well as for outreach projects in biology and ECET for local students and teachers in grades 7-12. The hands-on experiences made possible with this instrument are expected to inspire more students to enter and remain in STEM fields.

Baerwald	09/30/2013	$635,000.00	Sharon Jones, Jeffrey Pfaffmann, Kristen Sanford Bernhardt	ruebeckc@lafayette.edu	High Street	Easton	PA	180421768	6103305029	SBE	7318	7322, 9187, 9197, 9278, EGCH	$0.00	Life-cycle analysis (LCA) is an emerging foundation for investigating the environmental consequences of industrial systems on a holistic basis. LCA does not meaningfully incorporate models of buyer and seller behaviors that drive actual production and consumption and the subsequent environmental impact, however. LCA therefore has been applied predominantly to firm-specific engineering process improvement or to product design. As a result LCA has yet to meaningfully affect environmental policy making on a larger scale. This research project will build on the experience of two of the investigators, who were involved in the development of a decision-making model that combined economic incentives with environmental data to produce more varied and robust results than previously incorporated in LCA. This new project will improve the versatility of the model by incorporating agent-based modeling to study the environmental and economic implications of three technologically and economically diverse markets: shipping pallets, cell phone batteries, and municipal water delivery systems. Agent-based modeling will permit modeling of a more complex system with many decision-making agents, and it will allow the different agents to have heterogeneous characteristics. Agents will be implemented as computer software objects that interact according to behavioral and environmental rules specified by the researcher. The choice of products to analyze in this project is motivated by their very different market structures and the variety of their environmental impacts. The shipping pallet market has many heterogeneous buyers and sellers, potentially exacerbating its environmental impact. The producer side of the cell phone market is highly concentrated, but there are many buyers. Competition for buyers has created rapid technological replacement cycles and equipment disposal long before the end of its useful life. Water delivery systems are heavily regulated and, as a result, are typically bilateral monopolies with important environmental consequences related to the negotiated delivery infrastructure.<br/><br/>By strengthening environmental analysis as a holistic decision-making tool, this project will improve decision making within the three resource-intensive industries described above, thereby reducing wood, electronic device, and water waste. The computational models and methods developed in the conduct of this project will be applicable to many other industries that have significant environmental impacts, such as packaging and personal computers. Findings will be presented at scientific meetings and in print, and the software tools that are developed will be made available to other researchers, industry, and government agencies. This project will enhance education in undergraduate and graduate studies by providing extensive interdisciplinary research experience for undergraduate students, through incorporation of improved modeling and assessment techniques in courses, and through an on-line toolkit that will provide access to the software tools and other materials for researchers and practitioners. An award resulting from the FY 2007 NSF-wide competition on Human and Social Dynamics (HSD) supports this project. All NSF directorates and offices are involved in the coordinated management of the HSD competition and the portfolio of HSD awards.

Active learning is a kind of machine learning, a key aspect of Robust Intelligence. A central aim of machine learning is to develop techniques that construct models of data in order to help make predictions in future situations. The past decades have seen huge advances in machine learning that uses labeled data. However, labels are often difficult to obtain. Active learning addresses situations in which the data are unlabeled, and any labels must be explicitly requested and paid for. The aim of active learning is to learn a good classifier with as few labels as possible. Despite its practical importance, active learning is a comparatively underdeveloped area in machine learning.<br/><br/>This project will rigorously investigate the potential of intelligent querying, and develop practical, label-efficient learning algorithms. It will bring together a diversity of student talent, from theoreticians to domain experts in biology and vision applications. The resulting algorithms will be made widely available, and have the potential to increase the applicability of machine learning to the many large-scale problems in which difficulty of labeling is a critical bottleneck.<br/><br/>

Relative success in solving these problems on a regular basis has made modern society possible. Thus, how people solve cooperation problems and survive situations where their personal interests conflict with the interests of the groups to which they belong is a central question within the social sciences. <br/><br/>This research project engages the most recent theories of cooperation. Among the most promising approaches to the cooperation problem is Altruistic Punishment theory. In a nutshell, altruistic punishment refers to the willingness to punish defectors (free riders, who refuse to contribute to a collective good) even when doing so is materially costly and provides no direct benefits. This dissertation will attempt to answer three interlinked questions: (1) Is there evidence for a framework of adaptation for social exchange that involves altruistic punishment? (2) What are the psychological determinants of cooperation and altruistic punishment? (3) To what extent do these psychological factors explain individual differences observed in the laboratory experiments? Answers to these three questions would shed light not only on the specific research question of the psychology of altruistic punishment but also on how cooperation problems are solved. <br/><br/>In order to answer these three research questions a series of experiments have been designed that involve economic decision making tasks - specifically, providing collective goods in small groups and punishing, as the participants please, those who do not contribute. Participants are tested on two key psychological scales, Machiavellianism, which measures a person's tendency to deceive and manipulate others for personal gain, and social conformism. In a second series of experiments, the affective components of altruistic punishment will be investigated. The project expects that altruistic punishment is basically an emotional response to a norm violation. In order to test this theory, the participants' mood is manipulated in experiments.<br/><br/>This study will have broader impacts as the psychological insight resulting from this research could aid field researchers who investigate real life cooperation problems, such as those involving fisheries and management of other common pool resources. A better understanding of the mechanisms responsible for inducing cooperation can ultimately influence how policymakers design institutions. Societies rely heavily upon formalized institutions to remain intact, and a psychologically realistic model of cooperative behavior would undoubtedly help calibrate the institutional framework for addressing cooperation problems.

Rice	08/31/2010	$253,866.00		emperdue@bsu.edu	Office of Sponsored Programs	Atlanta	GA	303320420	4048944819	GEO	1670	0000, OTHR	$0.00	Dissolved organic matter (DOM) plays major roles in oceanic and global biogeochemical processes as it is one of the Earth's largest active carbon pools. Determining the detailed composition and structure of DOM offers unparalleled rewards as their informational richness represents a unique set of biogeochemical tracers capable of providing important insights into the origins of their parent waters and the diagenetic alterations that have occurred within those waters during transport. Recent analytical breakthroughs have the potential to bring a major fraction of marine DOM within our analytical window, thus greatly facilitating the reading of DOM's molecular messages. In addition, there has been promising improvement in the ability to isolate DOM using reverse osmosis coupled with electrodialysis (RO/ED) that can now isolate up to 95% of marine DOM compared to ~10-40% for previous techniques. <br/><br/>In this research, a new investigator from Old Dominion University will lead a team that also includes Georgia Institute of Technology that will combine improved isolation of marine DOM with the unparalleled power of ultra-high resolution FT-ICR MS and advanced NMR spectroscopy to gain major new insights into the composition of marine DOM and the biogeochemical processes controlling its composition. The main goals of this proposed study are to: (1) characterize bio-refractory DOM that dominates the marine DOM pool especially in the deep sea; (2) characterize newly produced DOM in an upwelling region and the semi-biolabile and photobleached DOM that accumulates in oligotrophic, subtropical gyre surface waters; and (3) compare RO/ED isolated DOM to the original sample and to DOM isolated using ultrafiltration and solid-phase extraction (e.g., XAD and C18). <br/><br/>In terms of broader impacts, this research will lay the foundations for future oceanic and global biogeochemical studies where these advanced techniques can be used to trace compounds or component classes of DOM from their multifarious sources, along their various paths of diagenesis and transport, to their points of export, microbial uptake or mineralization. In addition, the PIs will provide critically needed precursory reference material for the marine biogeochemical community. The proposed study will support a new Assistant Research Professor at ODU and three doctoral students. Collaborative ties with investigators from WHOI, MIT and the HOT site will foster cooperative field-based research. Public outreach and information dissemination will be facilitated by creation of a dedicated project website and through public and news media interactions, as appropriate.

Itsweire	09/30/2009	$240,038.00		arnoldo@ufl.edu	1 UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA	GAINESVILLE	FL	326112002	3523923516	GEO	1610	0000, OTHR	$0.00	Intellectual Merit<br/>Observations of circulation and related physical variables have been collected in Bahia Concepcion, on the Gulf of California side of the Baja California peninsula in Mexico. The first goal of the original study was to describe through observations how rotation affects the wind-driven circulation in a relatively deep, well-mixed, semi-enclosed bay. We are in the process of submitting those results for publication. The period of observations, originally planned to last only through the well-mixed winter season, was extended to the entire year, including the highly stratified summer season. The extended data set gives us the opportunity to describe the physics of the bay when the water column is stratified. This study focuses on three separate time scales: the seasonal cycle associated with the onset and demise of stratification, the internal tides, and the barotropic and baroclinic seiches. The second goal of the original study was to develop an analytical model to represent the circulation driven by tides and the effects of friction and rotation on the estuarine flow. Those tasks are now complete. Motivated by the results of the winter observations we propose here to develop analytical models of three-dimensional time-dependent wind-driven flow, including the effect of advection, and to extend the tidal modeling effort to include stratified basins.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/>The ecological and societal importance of small coastal basins (bays, estuaries, lagoons) is out<br/>of proportion with their size. Among many other important ecological functions, lagoons and estuaries serve as way stations for migrating birds, as nurseries for an immense variety of fauna and flora and as mating and calving grounds for marine mammals such as the Pacific gray whale. At the same time these water bodies have been deeply impacted by anthropogenic activities. Many, if not all, are used as pathways through which sewage and contaminated waters are introduced into the ocean. In the past three years we have developed contacts with and given talks to engineering consultants and lay groups who are stewards of several lagoons in San Diego county. We plan to further develop these associations by providing free advice and consultation. By way of mitigation, The So. Cal. Edison company is undertaking an eighty million dollar restoration of San Dieguito Lagoon, north of San Diego. Here we propose to work with Coastal Environments, the consultancy charged with the scientific management of the project at the same time as we advise the San Dieguito Lagoon conservancy and other advocate groups. This project will allow us to participate in summer hands-on activities with high school students, and continue our outreach efforts with Florida elementary schools. In addition, this study represents a collaboration between scientists from the USA, including a minority representative, and Mexican scientists. The study will continue to enhance the participation of minority groups in science. It will train one graduate student and one Post-Doc and expose many others, including minority undergraduates, to state-of-the-art data collection, analysis and the application of numerical models. It will facilitate international cooperation and capacity building in Mexico and will also greatly enhance the courses taught by the PIs at graduate and undergraduate levels.

This project is developing a sequence of virtual field experiences to provide pre-service undergraduate students with early exposure to working directly with K-12 learners. The sequence consists of three three-week modules focusing on a key professional practice: mathematical problem solving, diagnosing student mathematical thinking, and scaffolding mathematical understanding. The modules are customizable in terms of content from algebra, geometry, and probability and statistics; and they build on the unique resources of the Math Forum's Problems of the Week (PoW) environment. This web-based system presents students with challenging nonroutine problems to which written solutions are submitted and for which mentoring is available to deepen students' mathematical understanding. Implementation is taking place at five teacher education programs with diverse student populations, allowing refinement of materials to meet the strengths and needs of a broad representation of pre-service teachers. Project evaluation is providing ongoing data to both project staff and participating instructors concerning: i) the nature of participants' engagement in and use of module activities; ii) the factors influencing the extent and quality of the implementations, and iii) the impact on preservice teachers' mathematical thinking and disposition towards exploring and cultivating mathematical habits of mind in themselves and the K-12 students. The intellectual merit of this project lies in its grounding in the well regarded resources and associated community of the Math Forum and its leveraging of the research findings about online communities of practice resulting from an ongoing investigation, the Online Mentoring Project. In addition the project is informed by findings from an extensive literature on i) the value of early teaching experiences within pre-service teacher education programs and ii) the importance of developing pedagogical content knowledge in teachers along with core content knowledge. Broader impacts are being felt through the diverse set of participating teacher education programs as well as the large community of Math Forum participants.

Because such data bases never have identical content, it is necessary to write transforms (or adaptors) to convert such disparate data into a common form. The construction of such transforms is widely believed to be a major cost of data integration projects. <br/>The purpose of the Morpheus project is to capture a large number of such transforms in a repository by crawling the web for publicly available ones and providing high level tools for efficient transform construction. In addition, powerful browsing tools are anticipated that allow users to locate interesting transforms quickly in the repository by providing keyword search of documentation, search within a classification hierarchy of transforms, search by the provenance of transforms, as well as search by the input/output characteristics. <br/>Morpheus is expected to dramatically reduce the cost of writing and maintaining data integration transforms, which will ease the difficulty of future data integration projects. <br/>This project will support graduate students at both Massachusetts Institute of Technology and University of Florida. In addition, transform construction will be used as student exercises in data base classes at both institutions. Further information can be obtained from the project web site: http://www.cise.ufl.edu/~jhammer/morpheus/ where research results will be disseminated and prototype code will be available.

Under the Center's ?Open-door? policy, this instrument will be available to researchers at the university and in the region, for projects in a wide variety of areas. Seven productive university researchers, in a variety of disciplines, will use this instrument in their research. These researchers need the instrument either because it offers multiphoton capability in an inverted microscope platform, or because its rapid scan rate offers live cell capabilities in a true confocal scanner, or both. The major users' research areas are: Euglenid taxonomy; synthetic organic chemistry; biochemistry of lipoprotein assembly; functional neural imaging; developmental neurobiology; modulation of insect immunity; and plant cell biology. <br/><br/>This microscope will be in a 38-year-old imaging center that is the premier central facility for high-end imaging for the university community, currently serving at least 60 researchers in 22 departments or other administrative units at the university and other regional institutions. The aim of the center is to provide and maintain cutting-edge instrumentation to support the research needs of the faculty, as well as to serve as a resource for training students and staff. The center and its microscopes are widely used in instruction in high-level imaging at both the Graduate and Undergraduate levels, as well as informal community instruction through tours and demonstrations at local schools. Finally, the instrumentation at the center has been used to support regional microscopy meetings for demonstrating state-of-the-art imaging technology.
0736184	The Cultural Politics of Fair Trade Coffee: Commodifying Social Justice	BCS	CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY	05/15/2007	06/25/2008	Molly Doane	IL	University of Illinois at Chicago	Standard Grant	Deborah Winslow	09/30/2009	$23,329.00		mdoane@uic.edu	809 S MARSHFIELD	Chicago	IL	606124305	3129962862	SBE	1390	0000, 9179, OTHR, SMET	$0.00	This ethnographic, multi-site research project concerns the production, consumption and cultural marketing of organic fair-trade coffee. Fair trade is a globally regulated system based on direct market links between socially conscious consumers and poor rural producers. Most studies of commodity chains concern the economic effects of producer/consumer relationships. In departure from these, this study will examine the social relationships established through the fair trade commodity chain, as well as the intentions, values, ideals, and politics that are traded along with the product. The research objectives are (1) to understand changes in the coffee cultivation system from the perspective of growers and marketers in Chiapas. Mexico; (2) to understand what the labels of organic and fair trade signify to producers and buyers/consumers; (3) to understand, from the perspective of each participating group, local hopes for political or economic change vis a vis the fair trade relationship; and (4) to understand to what extent and in what ways involvement in organic fair trade regimes are linked to ideas about self and identity. <br/><br/>The one-year research project is based on participant observation Mexico and the United States, and interviews with coffee producers, fair trade leaders, and consumers. American environmentalism is often glossed as consumer-driven, by desires to have pure food, green spaces, and wildlife. In contrast, Mexican social movements have been more often regarded as producer-driven, by desires for the equitable distribution of land, the need to preserve forest resources for subsistence use, and the desire to access niche organic food markets. The global fair-trade movement is significant because it combines elements of both newer environmental movements and older peasant movements based on subsistence demands. This research will provide new knowledge by outlining the strengths and weaknesses of a movement that links a luxury, coffee consumption, to concerns for basic social justice. It will contribute to social science theory of globalization by linking economic and cultural processes.

The detection by Dr. Cowan and his collaborators of the long-lived radioactive element thorium in several, and recently uranium in one, Galactic halo stars has provided a perhaps unique opportunity to directly determine the ages of the oldest stars. Dr. Cowan will also introduce a chronometer pair, Th/Hf, to make age determinations for the oldest stars in the Galaxy. These studies, independent of cosmological models and parameters and chemical evolution models, will result in more accurate age estimates for the oldest stars than previously possible and will help to answer the fundamental questions of just how old are the Galaxy and the Universe.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of the proposed research activity involve several areas. The NSF-supported research is incorporated directly into the course curriculum of Dr. Cowan's regularly taught introductory astronomy course for non-science majors. Both graduate and undergraduate students are involved in the research activities of Dr. Cowan, including female students who are being trained and mentored by Dr, Cowan. As part of public outreach, Dr. Cowan also regularly gives public lectures on astronomy to the general public.

In particular, star formation is perhaps the worst understood and least developed ingredients of modern cosmological simulations. This collaborative project, led by Dr Kravtsov, aims to reduce greatly the uncertainty in the physics of galaxy formation by developing new, observationally motivated models for the formation of stars and star clusters. Recent advances in numerical algorithms and computing power mean that cosmological hydrodynamical simulations can now resolve the actual sites of star formation in the interstellar medium, making it possible to track the formation and destruction of giant molecular clouds self-consistently. The planned suite of ultra high-resolution N-body and gas dynamic adaptive mesh refinement simulations will incorporate an unprecedented wealth of physical processes, including the formation of molecular hydrogen on dust and its self-shielding from ambient ultraviolet radiation, and self-consistent three-dimensional continuum radiative transfer. On smaller unresolved scales, the simulations will incorporate star formation recipes based on reliable empirical correlations. The planned research will study the molecular content of high-redshift galaxies, develop star formation prescriptions consistent with the observational correlations, and study star formation in different galactic environments. It will address the formation and evolution of massive star clusters, for which abundant observational data exist, and investigate the dependence of cluster formation efficiency on properties of the host galaxy.<br/><br/>This project is unique in its ability to bridge the large scales of galaxy formation and the small scales of star formation, thus developing links between those two research communities. By involving students, the work provides professional training of young computational cosmologists in cutting-edge simulation techniques. The results provide support for current and forthcoming space- and ground-based observing programs. The research results are tightly integrated into academic teaching, and public education and outreach activities. Three-dimensional visualizations of the simulations will be available for planetarium shows and public lectures, and also web-accessible.
0728101	Nonlinear Dynamics of Seat-Occupant Systems with Nonlinear Viscoelastic Models of Flexible Polyurethane Foam	CMMI	DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS	08/01/2007	04/27/2009	Anil Bajaj	IN	Purdue University	Standard Grant	Eduardo A. Misawa	07/31/2011	$292,458.00	Patricia Davies	bajaj@ecn.purdue.edu	Young Hall	West Lafayette	IN	479072114	7654941055	ENG	7478	034E, 1057, 9146, 9178, 9231, 9251, CVIS, MANU	$0.00	The static and dynamic (ride) comfort of seat occupants are of paramount importance. Most seat design is still done from experience, and trial and error prototyping. The experimentally measured responses for human subjects or mannequins are explained based on simplified vibratory motion models incorporating a series of linear springs, masses and dashpots. These models have no relationship to the actual physics of the system in terms of its geometry, rigid-body component properties, and the structural system of seat suspension and supportive flexible polyurethane foam. So, they cannot be used for understanding effects of design changes on occupant comfort or other measures used to distinguish between seats. Some recent efforts that have shown limited success have introduced two-dimensional models wherein the occupant is considered supported by a finite number of linear springs and dashpots. Such models, when developed sufficiently, have the potential to ultimately be useful for realistic simulations of the occupant's response to various road conditions. This capability will lead the way to significantly reduced dependence on trial-and-error prototyping and the associated costs in the development of future automotive seats. The key to this development is accurate models of flexible polyurethane foam (FPU). The overall system dynamics also depends on the interface between the seat foam and the occupant body, which is complex with possible slipping, as well as loss of contact and impacts at high vibration levels. Finally, the foam models will also be useful as this material has become the material of choice in cushioning and support applications, including automotive and airplane seats, wheelchairs and hospital bedding, and sports equipment like shoes and shin guards. <br/>The goal of this work is to develop comprehensive physics-based two-dimensional models of seat-mannequin systems and to investigate the performance of these dynamic models in predicting the response of mannequins to various dynamic inputs. The essential physical components of such a dynamic seat-mannequin system model include rigid-body model of the mannequin, a sufficiently realistic model of flexible polyurethane foam, and models for seat-occupant interfaces at the seatback and the seat bottom. 1. Flexible Polyurethane Foam (FPU) is a highly nonlinear and viscoelastic material whose behavior is also dependent on its microstructural properties. This work will construct 2D- and 3D-nonlinear visco-hyperelastic material models of polyurethane foam for accurate modeling of foam behavior and the complex shear interactions that arise at the seat-occupant interface. Finite element models of microstructure of foam utilizing interconnected nonlinear viscoelastic beams will be used to model the microstructural behavior. Experiments and system identification techniques will be utilized to extract parameters for macroscopic models to fit experimental results as well as predictions from microstructure-based models. 2. The nonlinear viscoelastic models of foam will be incorporated into multi-body seat-occupant models, with special attention paid to models of interactions at the interfaces. The resulting seat-mannequin models will be in the form of nonlinear integro-differential-algebraic equations. These models are expected to be capable of predicting system responses under realistic excitations including transients and steady vibrations to periodic inputs. Solution techniques for such mathematical models are not well developed other than direct numerical simulation. Semi-analytical techniques based on multi-frequency harmonic balance method will be developed to predict responses for periodic excitations. The frequency-amplitude response predictions will be compared to results of direct time-integration and experimentally measured responses at different levels of vertical excitations, thus verifying the model as well as the model development methodology. Thus, the research undertaken is expected to advance the modeling of nonlinear viscoelastic materials with microstructure as well as the ability to accurately simulate the dynamics of seat-occupant systems.

Ferroelectric materials have the potential to replace ferromagnetic materials for next-generation storage media, because they can be controlled at smaller scales than their magnetic counterparts. By stretching these materials over corrugated substrates, it will be possible to alter their properties significantly. State-of-the-art imaging techniques capable of resolving switching of ferroelectric bits at speeds that are fundamentally and technologically important. <br/>An important component of this research will be collaboration with Seagate Research in Pittsburgh.

Collaborations with researchers at Argonne National Laboratory will give students a broad exposure to interdisciplinary collaborative research. <br/><br/>TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: <br/><br/>Dr. Levy will investigate lattice and domain dynamics of ferroelectric thin films that have been patterned or templated at nanoscale dimensions. The goal is to determine how nanodomain structure, switching speeds, microwave response and soft phonon modes are influenced by nanoscale boundary conditions. These boundary conditions will be manipulated either during growth of oxide ferroelectrics or afterwards through electron-beam induced etching or focused ion beam patterning. Levy has developed a variety of high spatial and temporal resolution optical probes spanning the GHz-THz range that will provide local information about the ferroelectric soft mode and polar dynamics. To assist current and future students in learning many of the prerequisite concepts related to the proposed research, Prof. Levy will collaborate with Prof. Singh (also at the University of Pittsburgh) who has been developing tutorials in advanced undergraduate and graduate-level subjects such as quantum mechanics. Prof. Singh will work with Prof. Levy and his students to develop tutorials on relevant topics, e.g., notions of crystal symmetry, tensor notation, principles of scanning probe microscopy, and nanofabrication techniques. An explicit aim for these tutorials is to reduce barriers often encountered by students, especially women and minorities, entering science and engineering disciplines by providing scaffolding and support. <br/>An important component of this research will be collaboration with Seagate Research in Pittsburgh.

0727883	Micronekton of the Cariaco Basin: Adaptation to a Severe Oxygen Minimum	OCE	BIOLOGICAL OCEANOGRAPHY	08/01/2007	08/29/2012	Joseph Torres	FL	University of South Florida	Standard Grant	David L. Garrison	08/31/2013	$371,050.00		jjtorres@usf.edu	3702 Spectrum Blvd.	Tampa	FL	336129446	8139742897	GEO	1650	0000, OTHR	$0.00	The oxygen minimum zone of the Cariaco Basin in the coastal waters of Venezuela is one of the most severe in the world. Like most zones of severe oxygen minima in the oceans, it is the result of periods of high productivity coupled with microbial degradation of the sinking organic matter with utilization of the dissolved oxygen, and restricted circulation of its deeper waters. The shallow sill of the Cariaco basin (140 m) severely restricts exchange with the rest of the Atlantic.Ocean. Below a depth of approximately 250 m the basin is anoxic, and hydrogen sulfide, a metabolic poison, is present at depths below 400 m in high concentrations. Not surprisingly, the fish and invertebrates of these waters principally exist in the oxygenated waters of the upper 200 m. This project involves the characterization of the vertical distribution, abundance, and species composition of the Cariaco Basin fish and invertebrate communities. Not only is the identity of much of this community unknown, but their relationship to the oxygen minimum is undescribed. A classic Cariaco Basin study from 1973 reported the presence of a small fish, the codlet, Bregmaceros cantori, that had the ability to migrate into the sulfide laden waters of the oxygen minimum as part of its normal diel pattern, and resided there during the day for up to 12 h. The investigators will also study how this fish achieves this remarkable feat. The Cariaco community will be sampled with discrete net tows aboard the CARIACO time-series vessel, the R/V Hermano Gines, in collaboration with Venezuelan scientists. The ability to tolerate sulfide or detoxify sulfide in the tissues of the codlet and the other species of fishes will be examined using a suite of novel techniques including metabolic enzyme measurements, determining presence of sulfides in tissues of fish caught during the day, tolerance of sulfide by important respiratory proteins, sulfide detoxification by gill, liver, blood, and muscle, and mitochondrial respiration in the presence of sulfide. Whether the codlet survives using an aerobic or anaerobic strategy will be evaluated based on the accumulation of anaerobic end products in fish captured during the day, enzyme activities, and possibly circulatory adaptations to allow retention of oxygen in the swimbladder. In addition to the international scientific collaboration the project will also involve the training of graduate students from the US and Venezuela.
0720901	The Selection and Incentive Effects of Equal-Sharing	SES	ECONOMICS	08/01/2007	11/10/2008	Ran Abramitzky	CA	Stanford University	Continuing grant	Nancy A. Lutz	07/31/2010	$219,342.00		ranabr@stanford.edu	3160 Porter Drive	Palo Alto	CA	943041212	6507232300	SBE	1320	0000, OTHR	$0.00	Incentive theory predicts that more equal sharing (pay less sensitive to performance) provides insurance but discourages participation of high-ability individuals and encourages free-riding. Yet, evaluating the empirical relevance of these predictions has been challenging, mainly due to data limitation. This proposed research will take a step towards filling this gap by analyzing unique data sets that are especially suited to test the selection and incentive effects of equal-sharing. The data contain rich panel information on both individuals and Kibbutzim (plural of Kibbutz), which are communities that have recently shifted non-uniformly from an equal-sharing scheme to pay-for-performance.<br/><br/>Broadly, the three proposed projects will contribute to incentive theory, which is at the heart of economics. The first project tests whether equal-sharing discourages participation of high-ability workers. It analyzes exit from and entry to Kibbutzim with a unique panel data of individuals linked across population censuses. The second project provides a unique empirical analysis of the free-rider problem by testing whether and to what extent equal-sharing leads to free riding behavior in the decisions of hours worked, absenteeism from work and fertility. To do so, this project merges individual-level Labor Force Surveys, which are conducted annually and contain information on these decisions, with a unique Kibbutz-level data set constructed through archival work. The project performs difference-in-difference analysis to test whether members in Kibbutzim that shifted away from full equal-sharing during the sample period worked longer hours, reduced absenteeism and reduced fertility. The third project tests the factors mitigating the trade-off between insurance and participation. A simple model of the Kibbutz as an insurance device facing participation constraints is considered and confronted with the data. The empirical test evaluates the relative importance of factors highlighted by the model vs. ideological factors highlighted by sociologists in determining the degree of equal-sharing and in mitigating negative selection.<br/><br/>BROADER IMPACT: This research contributes to our understanding of organizations that are subject to negative selection. Among these are professional partnerships, cooperatives, and labor managed firms, which are often based on revenue-sharing. For example, in professional partnerships such as law firms, just like as Kibbutzim, high-ability partners are expected to exit to earn a wage premium for their ability outside of the partnership. Second, this research will be among the first to test using individual-level data a well-known yet widely-disputed hypothesis, which has implications regarding immigration policy. This hypothesis, known as Borjas'' selection hypothesis, postulates a positive self-selection of migrants when the country of origin has a more equal earnings distribution than the destination, while a negative self-selection is expected when the country of origin has a more unequal earnings distribution. If it holds empirically, this hypothesis implies that immigrants from more equal origins are more likely to be of high quality. Third, by evaluating the extent to which individuals free ride at the workplace, this project sheds light on the usefulness of unemployment benefit programs. Also, by evaluating the effect on fertility of an extreme change in fertility incentives, this project contributes to our understanding of the usefulness of programs designed to encourage fertility, an issue that is subject to policy debates in Europe. Last, Kibbutzim present a puzzle for economists as economic theory predicts that communities based on equal-sharing are likely to unravel due to moral hazard and adverse selection. Yet, unlike many other communes in history, Kibbutzim have persisted successfully for most of the 20th century and formed one of the largest communal movements in history, consisting today of 120,000 members living in 268 Kibbutzim. This research will shed light on this puzzle by analyzing the factors that allow Kibbutzim to coexist within a capitalist environment and evaluating the role of economic factors in organizations often claimed to be driven by ideology.

The objective of this research is to develop TTS technologies that focus on elimination of concatenation errors, and accurate speech modifications in the areas of coarticulation, degree of articulation, prosodic effects, and speaker characteristics. The investigators are exploring an asynchronous interpolation model (AIM), which promises to provide for high-quality and flexible TTS. The core idea of AIM is to represent a short region of speech as a composition of several types of features called streams.<br/>Each stream is computed by asynchronous interpolation of basis vectors.<br/>Each basis vector is associated with a particular phoneme, allophone, or more specialized unit. Thus, the speech region is described by the varying degrees of influence of several types of preceding and following acoustic features. Using AIM, the investigators are also developing methods to optimally compress the acoustic inventories of TTS systems, given a size or a quality constraint, and to adapt the system to a new voice, given a few training samples. The system being researched forms a hybrid between traditional concatenative and formant-based synthesis, having advantages of both, resulting in a high-quality, optimized TTS system with voice adaptation capabilities. TTS has generally recognized societal benefits for universal access, education, and information access by voice. Our research will make it possible, for example, to build personalized TTS systems for individuals with speech disorders who can only intermittently produce normal speech sounds.<br/>

AFM is the only technique that can image wet, native samples with nanometer resolution, and it has also emerged as a key technology for manipulation-type studies of single molecules and complexes, including protein and RNA folding-unfolding under tension, and studies of enzyme activity under compressive confinement. Fluorescence microscopy has also progressed over the last decade to single molecule localization considerably beyond the classical diffraction limit, and structural dynamics by intramolecular distance, spatial orientation and mobility. The goal of this award is to design and develop a new instrument that will report the internal structural changes of single macromolecules and surface layers by single molecule fluorescence microscopy, simultaneous with application and detection of relevant mechanical forces and distances by AFM. The long term objective for this new microscope is to increase fundamental understanding of assembly, folding and function of macromolecules and surface layers. <br/><br/>Beyond research discoveries made possible with the new microscope, the broader impacts of the award include training, outreach and communication. Students and post-doctoral fellows will be integrated into the mechanical, optical, electronic and software development. The cross-disciplinary experience of conceiving a new technology, bringing it to practical fruition, and applying it directly to a current scientific problem cannot be obtained in any other way. The new microscope will be in the Penn Nano-Bio Interface Center, which provides community outreach that educates under-represented groups and high school students and teachers.

Argos is a satellite-based data collection and geo-location system dedicated to monitoring and protecting the environment. Any mobile platform carrying an Argos transmitter can be located anywhere in the world, and data from sensors connected to the transmitter can be collected, processed and distributed anywhere in the world. Location information is derived through Doppler or GPS. The types of platforms on which Argos transmitters are deployed varies widely, and includes ships, land stations, fixed data buoys, drifting buoys, and profiling floats. Among other things, these platforms provide valuable measurements of meteorological and oceanographic conditions such as monitoring the tropical Pacific Ocean for El Nino - La Nina events. Study of animal behavior is a growing application of Argos. Animals such as turtles, whales, sea lions, polar bears, elk, moose, reindeer, eagles, condors, etc., are among the many species being tracked. Very small transmitters weighing less than 20 grams are used to track birds. A recent type of high technology transmitter in use is the Pop-Up Satellite Archival Tag which records the movements of marine animals (tuna, eels, sharks, whales, etc.) below the surface. This type of tag will release from the animal weeks or months later, rise to the surface, and transmit the collected data. Thousands of Argos transmitters are in operation around the world. The Argos system has been operational since 1978. It was established under an agreement between the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA, USA), and the French Space Agency (CNES).

Wehmschulte, Department of Chemistry, Florida Institute of Technology is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division to investigate the the preparation of novel, highly reactive cationic aluminum and gallium compounds and the subsequent investigation of their properties. It is expected that these compounds can be applied as catalysts in several important processes including C-H and C-F activation, arene functionalization, and carbonylation and hydrogenation reactions. The new compounds will be obtained through application of large chemically robust and flexible terphenyl substituents in combination with modern weakly coordinating counterions. A wide variety of analytical tools including NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, X-ray diffraction and quantum chemical calculations will by employed in the investigation of the new compounds and their reactivity. This work has the potential to provide new and facile synthetic procedures for important compounds and key intermediates in synthetic chemistry. In addition, postdoctorals, graduate students and undergraduate students will be exposed to a wide range of synthetic, analytical and computational techniques and learn valuable skills. An outreach program to nearby undergraduate institutions and a local high school may attract students to scientific careers.

Ants may change tasks as they age, beginning as nurses and ending as foragers. Their brains need to be plastic so that they can generate age-appropriate behavior. In some species, workers show specialized behaviors, such as defending the colony, and are equipped with large and powerful jaws that make them effective soldiers. If workers are specialized for defense, their brains must respond to stimuli associated with threats to the colony and control aggressive behavior. Thus the brain of a nurse should respond only to the needs of brood and the brain of a defender should respond to threats from enemies. The project will analyze ant social behavior and examine age- and task-specific differences in the size of worker brains, brain compartments and individual nerve cells as well as the chemical composition of the brains of workers of different species in an extremely diverse group of ants. The expected subtle brain differences will help to understand how slight changes in brain structure and function can result in pronounced behavioral differences and how behavior develops during maturation. The project will train graduate and undergraduate students (including minority students) in behavioral, anatomical, neurobiological and molecular techniques and enrich the education of K-12 students by introducing them to behavior, neuroscience, ecology and evolution.

Greenspan	07/31/2011	$250,000.00		rupak@cs.ucla.edu	10889 Wilshire Boulevard	LOS ANGELES	CA	900951406	3107940102	CSE	7352	9218, HPCC	$0.00	0702743<br/>Rupak Majumdar<br/>University of California - SD<br/><br/>Collaborative: Software Verification for Hardware Models<br/><br/>Modern microprocessors are some of the most complex engineering artifacts ever constructed, and their design complexity has been increasing in every generation. Correctness is a fundamental concern for microprocessors: all software applications implicitly assume correct operation of the processor. As demonstrated by the infamous Pentium division bug, the cost of bugs in the final system is prohibitive. Validating these complex designs is a real challenge. Current practice of extensive simulation for design validation is inadequate as it can only exercise a small portion of the state space, leaving many key properties unchecked.<br/><br/>This research applies techniques from formal verification to verifying the correctness of higher-level models of complex processors. Higher level processor models written in programming languages like C, C++, or SystemC, are becoming more and more prevalent as golden reference models for subsequent hardware implementations. While hardware and processor verification have been an active area of research, the novelty of this research is to merge the high-level design structure and powerful automated abstraction techniques developed in software verification (such as Predicate Abstraction, Shape Analysis, and Atomicity) with the insights from hardware verification (such as proof decomposition and memory abstraction). Instead of the usual bit-level models used in hardware verification, the combined techniques are likely to produce more compact models, helping the reasoning to scale to large systems, such as the complete description of a modern microarchitecture.<br/><br/>The research will tie in with the investigators' educational objectives of developing graduate level courses that combine the principles of formal verification with the principles of reliable system design.

They will first investigate a more realistic interaction for protons, considering a broad distribution of wave propagation directions, as implied by observations and as predicted by their prior work in compressible MHD turbulence. The team will incorporate this proton heating effect into the spatial evolution of plasma flowing outward through a coronal hole, and they will then determine detailed wave intensities and spectra required to generate the observed solar wind distributions. <br/><br/>Since the spectra of alpha particles and the dispersion relation of the waves will evolve together and affect each other, the PI will use hybrid simulations to model this behavior in a self-consistent manner. The simulation will follow these microphysical dispersive interactions, which will then be incorporated into global coronal hole equations to describe the macrophysical evolution of the solar wind with increasing radial position. The PI's team will use the kinetic description resulting from this effort to explore the limits on the resonant wave spectra and spectral energy transport rates required to yield the observed fast solar wind, as well as the response of the flow properties to changing coronal hole conditions. The PI will also apply this approach to the collisionless slow solar wind. <br/><br/>Such rigorous kinetic understanding of the microphysical processes taking place in the coronal plasma will allow the PI's team to correctly reproduce the thermal behavior of the disturbed solar wind in global simulations of CME propagation. This knowledge will also enable the PI to accurately model the acceleration of solar energetic particles at CME shocks and other space weather phenomena. This research effort will involve student participation at all levels, including graduate students and postdocs, at the University of New Hampshire's Space Science Center.

The visit will help develop a detailed international collaborative research and education plan to determine cultural effects in the ways teachers interact with online courses designed to enhance science teachers' content knowledge and instructional abilities. The planned project will also include participation of the American Geological Institute (AGI) and the Museum of Natural History (AMNH). The visit will include preparation for logistical planning, visits to schools and on-site assessment of the technical compatibility of courses within the available infrastructure. As increased Internet access provides ways to overcome geographic, temporal and other barriers to educational opportunities, attention is turning to optimizing online course interactions. Research is beginning to provide insights into how online interactions are shaped by personal expectations and patterns of interpersonal communication, which can in turn be recognized as related to the learner's culture. The proposed project will extend that research to focus specifically on online science teacher professional interactions in graduate classrooms.<br/><br/>There is sufficient overlap of interests between faculty at Salisbury University and the University of Malaysia to indicate that they can successfully pursue the activities proposed, and that the interaction will benefit both sides. The research will have broad impact as distance learning becomes an increasingly prevalent form of teacher professional development. The education graduate students participating in both the visit and the planned research will be the ones who will provide professional development to teachers in the future, which makes their knowledge of culturally sensitive approaches to professional development of vital importance. In addition, U.S. teachers who take online graduate courses that are designed with explicit attention to cultural diversity will be more likely to extend that perspective to their students. Results of the research will be shared throughout the network of agencies doing similar online course development through professional meetings, conferences, publications and in prototype online course applications.

The project's long-term objective is to learn how vertebrates evolved from non-vertebrate chordates. This work tests the hypothesis that vertebrates evolved the ability of neural plate border genes to turn on neural crest specifiers. The project tests predictions of the hypothesis in Oikopleura dioica, a larvacean with a fully sequenced genome, using novel methods to alter hundreds of embryos at once. Larvaceans are ubiquitous marine organisms that are considered basal chordates that contribute substantially to the biomass and carbon cycling of oceans. Oikopleura orthologs of neural crest-related genes will be cloned and in situ hybridization will be used to learn their expression patterns. Neural crest-related gene regulatory networks in Oikopleura will be dissected by performing gain- and loss-of-function experiments with Oikopleura orthologs of key crest-related genes, and results by in situ hybridization and genomic microarray will be evaluated. Public understanding will be enhanced of the roles of larvaceans in the environment and in the investigation of vertebrate origins. Achieving these aims will define developmental mechanisms that vertebrates evolved to develop a full blown neural crest and illuminate mechanisms by which evolutionary novelties arise. Because larvaceans, especially Oikopleura dioica, remove large quantities of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide from the atmosphere for long-term storage in ocean depths, a better understanding of larvacean biology will help illuminate understanding of global warming. The project will educate school children about the role of larvaceans in ecology and the science of evolutionary biology and will mentor representatives of underrepresented groups, particularly minority undergraduates.

Leland	07/31/2008	$6,000.00		mkernis@uga.edu	310 East Campus Rd	ATHENS	GA	306021589	7065425939	SBE	1321	9179, SMET	$0.00	Individuals sometimes exhibit judgmental biases that result in excessive risk-taking and suboptimal performance outcomes. Recent research has demonstrated that egotistic concerns about maintaining positive self-views can instigate judgmental biases and subsequent risky behaviors that undermine performance outcomes. The proposed research examines whether these biases and risky behavior occur more among people with fragile (as opposed to secure) high self-esteem, especially following ego-threats. Fragile high self-esteem involves favorable, but shallow, feelings of self-worth that are unstable (i.e., experience substantial short-term fluctuations), contingent (i.e., dependent upon meeting specific outcomes or standards), or paired with discordant low implicit (i.e., largely non-conscious) self-esteem. In contrast, secure high self-esteem involves genuine and well-anchored positive feelings of self-worth that are relatively stable, not contingent, and paired with congruent high implicit self-esteem. Two studies are proposed. Study 1 examines the role of fragile versus secure high self-esteem in overconfidence and risk-taking behaviors. Study 2 examines the role of fragile versus secure high self-esteem in risky decision-making as a function of myopic focus on reward.

This project has three primary aims. The first extends development of a new method for constructing hierarchical trees from sequence data using maximum likelihood and modal inference. The tree construction is based upon application of either one of these two inference methods to an ancestral mixture model, a model whose parameters describe the population structure at each fixed time point T in the past. If one estimates this structure over a fine grid of time points T, the relationship between the estimates over time can be graphically described as a hierarchical tree. The second project aim is to enhance the biological realism of the ancestral mixture model to include (a) multi-state characters, (b) advanced models of sequence evolution, and (c) recombination. The extensions are based on using diffusion kernels constructed from continuous time Markov Chains. Empirical Bayes methods are also proposed to be employed to improve overall estimation precision. The third aim is development of a new method for reconstructing haplotype sequences from genotype data without knowing the parental information. The methods and algorithms are based on the ancestral mixture models together with a multi-moment approach that simplifies computation. In addition, the investigators propose to extend the method to long sequences by sliding a window along longer genotype sequences, then using the information from the overlapping estimates to construct longer haplotype estimates.<br/><br/>The current release of the National Center for Biotechnology Information's(NCBI) database dbSNP contains over 11.5 million human single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) records, representing a 10-fold increase over the last 4 years. Analysis of such data has become a focus of much research within bioinformatics and computational biology because it is the SNPs that carry the information that distinguishes the individuals within a species. Encoded in this data is important information about the relationship between the characteristics of an individual and their genetic code. The investigators are developing methods and models for this data that are fundamentally different in approach from the standard techniques currently used in two areas where SNP data is used, coalescent and phylogenetic inference, in which one reconstructs genetic relationships similar to family trees based on the current ancestors only. The broader impacts of this project include the development of methods and models with potential wide ranging uses across broad scientific disciplines, the increased fusion of biological and mathematical innovation, and opportunities for broad interdisciplinary training of diverse students.

Dr. Liu and collaborators will be conducting the largest and most sensitive direct imaging survey to date for massive (>1 Jupiter Mass) planets orbiting other stars. NICI (the Near-Infrared Coronagraphic Imager) is the new high contrast adaptive optics camera on the Gemini-South 8.1-meter telescope, tailored to direct detection of extrasolar planets through dual-channel methane-band imaging. NICI is expected to provide excellent sensitivity to planetary companions around young (< 100 million years) stars in the extended solar neighborhood.<br/><br/>In addition to providing images of the planets themselves, three specific issues in extrasolar planet formation are expected to be addressed through this work: 1) the distribution of planets in the outer (> 5-10 AU) regions of other solar systems, 2) the dependence of planet frequency on stellar host mass, and 3) the spectrophotometric properties of young extrasolar planets. Target selection will be optimized through Monte Carlo simulations and it is expected that several giant planets will be detected among the 150 young stars to be surveyed.<br/><br/>The research goals of this project will be accomplished in tandem with the training of a postdoctoral research associate at all stages of the project. This next generation of scientists will receive training in the rapidly growing fields of exoplanets and science with adaptive optics, as well as hands-on experience with real-time observing on an 8-meter telescope. In particular, development of observational techniques and expertise with high contrast adaptive optics systems is an important step toward future high angular resolution ground-based astronomy. Undergraduate students are also expected to be involved in the work through the Institute for Astronmy's ongoing NSF Research Experiences for Undergraduates program. Dr. Liu will also continue to participate in ongoing outreach efforts through public lectures and discussions, where this research and the results will be prominently featured.

These events support playful interactions as characters engage the emotions of the audience. The Act-It Out sequences invite children and parents to become involved in modeling scientific concepts, thus creating an environment where learning is the product of social interaction and kinesthetic, affective and interpersonal learning. To provide proof-of-concept that this a transferable model, an independent, interdisciplinary team from the University of Wisconsin, Madison Biotechnology Center will produce their own FST event that will be evaluated and compared to an existing FST program. The Madison Children''''s Museum will partner as a venue for the event and provide expertise in the planning process. The ultimate project resulting from this planning would include workshops to train collaborative teams from around the country in the principles and practices of FST, promotion of cross-disciplinary collaboration among professionals, and honing of an evaluation design for FST events. The trained teams would then produce FST events that reach children, their parents and the general public. The planning grant project design includes activities necessary to further test, verify and document Fusion Science Theater events. It provides a proof of concept of model effectiveness and transferability. It also initiates, develops and assesses ways to train other groups to implement the model and publicizes the model to national professional networks to spread the work and recruit site teams.

In particular, principles of mathematical modeling, dynamical systems theory, bifurcation theory, asymptotic analysis, stochastic processes, and numerical computation will be used and advanced by this work. The three biological themes of this work are the onset of cardiac arrhythmias, the construction and regulation of one-dimensional organelles, and the dynamics of biochemical networks in bacterial populations. Some specific, representative, problems to be studied are the cause of spontaneous calcium release events in cardiac cells leading to early afterdepolarizations, the effect of stretch activated receptors on cell depolarization in a region of hypoxia, the dynamics of the hypoxia response control system in cardiac cells, the mechanism of hook length regulation in Salmonella, the error prevention mechanism for chromosomal segregation during mitosis, and the structure and function of the quorum sensing biochemical network in vibrio fischeri.<br/><br/>While the biological problems to be studied are quite diverse, they are unified by their many common mathematical features. Thus, this work has the two-fold goal of using mathematical modeling approaches to understand several specific complex cellular processes, and to discover common principles and transferable concepts that are in operation in many different areas of biology. In this way, this work will contribute to the development of a fundamental and unified theory of how biological processes work, and in doing so, will contribute to our understanding of many issues relating to human health and medicine.

The EA will support a range of faculty and students research in paleolimnology, paleoceanography, terrestrial vegetation ecology, and marine and freshwater fish ecology. Undergraduate and Master-level students as well as other faculty from Cal-State Fullerton (CSUF) and institutions collaborative with the PIs will have access to the instrument with appropriate training. Data obtained from the EA will be used towards the completion of undergraduate research theses, Master's theses, and the 4 PIs own, and collaborative, research. The intellectual merit of this study is that each sub-project will advance the knowledge and understanding of major life-based elements in their respective Earth systems. The broader impacts of this work include research experience and thesis preparation for BSc and MSc students. As a Hispanic Serving Institute, this research will also provide research opportunities for underrepresented individuals in the sciences at CSUF. Acquisition of this system will also provide an opportunity for students to use technically advanced, yet accessible, equipment in the laboratory environment. Lastly, each of the PIs pursue environmental-based research. This research will expose students to important, socially relevant issues, particularly in Southern California where the impact of humans on the environment is especially salient.

Consider a chick hatching from an egg and how much more informative a movie is as compared to one photograph of the egg and another of the chick. In the study of materials, we are interested in how solids respond to various environments and stimuli. In the past we have studied transitions in materials by making many duplicate samples and stopping the transformation at a few time points to take essentially still photographs and then attempting to connect the dots between these time points. This approach is tedious and slow, not to mention riddled with uncertainties about missed information. The new instrument enables researchers to stimulate materials and record their response at the same time. Our imaging method detects chemical and topological features 500 times smaller than the thickness of a human hair, and also allows for sample manipulation on this length scale. Stimuli that are important for designing extraordinary properties into a new material include exposure to liquids and gases, temperature control, electric fields, and mechanical deformation. The materials to be studied have a wide variety of applications including membranes for fuel cells, highly sensitive chemical sensors, flexible electronics, engineered coatings, structured surfaces for tissue engineering, and high-efficiency solar cells. The instrument will be incorporated into our highly successful, professionally staffed regional facility that is open to all academic, industrial, and governmental scientists and engineers. <br/><br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/><br/>The new scanning electron microscope is equipped with a uniquely broad array of accessories to enable the combination of high-resolution imaging and nanoscale manipulation for powerful in situ experiments involving controlled stimuli and correlated response. In situ capabilities include nanoscale manipulation of specimens and exposure to fluids, gases, electrical fields, light, mechanical deformation, and temperature. The in situ approach enabled by this instrument is not only cleaner and more efficient than in-and-out procedures involving multiple instruments and exposure to air, it also makes possible entirely new, albeit high risk, initiatives to understand fundamental processes at the nanoscale. The experiments to be conducted go far beyond structural imaging, while incorporating this basic feature as an essential ingredient. We will also acquire an optical microscope with digital imaging/recording; this will serve as a front end for sample screening and preliminary measurements to inform and ensure the optimum use of the SEM. Seventeen faculty members associated with seven departments and representing all ranks have envisioned and planned remarkable experiments for this new instrument within four topical areas of nanoscale science: electrically responsive materials (including fuel cell membranes, flexible electronics, and nano circuitry), phase transitions (including superlattices, phase separation, and patterning), surface phenomena (including wetting, cell response, gas adsorption, and self-assembly), and mechanically responsive materials (including hard materials, proteins, and fluids). The user base will provide a focal point for initiating new collaborations, interactions and training/education initiatives. The instrument will be incorporated into our highly successful, professionally staffed regional facility that is open to academic, industrial, and governmental scientists and engineers. To encourage the full participation of local liberal arts colleges, particularly the highly selective women's college Bryn Mawr College, we will provide technical assistance and machine use to researchers from these institutions.

The program devised for this conference, presenting a coherent set of concepts and paradigms, will consist of five formal sessions covering 1) human interactions with plant volatiles, 2) the function of vegetative volatiles in the physiology and ecology of the plant, 3) the function of floral volatiles in the physiology and ecology of the plant, 4) biochemistry of plant volatiles, and 5) the use of instrumentation in studying plant volatiles. This meeting will be highly interdisciplinary, and the topics range from highly technical to those with general interests, for example the usages of plant volatiles in human affairs (e.g., foods, perfumes). By bringing diverse group of researchers together, this conference has the potential to have a major impact on many separate disciplines. Special efforts have been made to obtain a diverse and balanced group of speakers and to attract scientists at the early stages of their career, with emphasis on women and minorities, and have outlined specific steps to recruit and fund such participants.

Hence, architecting large-scale distributed systems that function correctly and provide adequate performance even when parts of them are compromised is one of the most important challenges.<br/> Byzantine replication is emerging as a promising direction to mitigate server compromise. Experience with Byzantine replication protocols reveals considerable shortcomings in the underlying theoretical foundation. Namely, existing fault models, metrics, and correctness criteria used to reason about and construct Byzantine replication algorithms, fail to capture properties that manifest themselves in wide-area environments. Since all existing Byzantine replication algorithms were designed to meet the standard safety and liveness criteria, they all exhibit critical vulnerabilities not covered by the standard models. <br/>This project will develop the theoretical foundation, architectural framework, and algorithmic techniques for a scalable wide-area Byzantine replication system that provides strong performance guarantees under attack. This includes: (1) expanding the existing theoretical fault models to better encapsulate the unique characteristics and performance vulnerabilities associated with scalable wide-area Byzantine replication systems; (2) defining useful metrics for evaluating and comparing different architectures, configurations, and algorithms with a focus on their performance under sophisticated attacks; (3) developing an architectural framework for scalable Byzantine replication that can be customized to topology, performance, and resiliency requirements of specific wide-area systems; and (4) developing specific algorithms for wide-area environments that provide strong performance guarantees under attack.

Sub-millimeter observations with the revolutionary SCUBA camera on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope on Mauna Kea, Hawaii, revealed the existence of a population of dust-obscured, ultra-luminous galaxies that dominates star formation in the high-redshift Universe. The new camera, SCUBA-2, speeds up the mapping of wide fields by almost three orders of magnitude, and will dramatically expand understanding of the sub-millimeter Universe and the history of dusty star formation. This project will carry out a SCUBA-2 survey of two heavily studied fields of the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey (GOODS), during weather conditions suitable for observing at a wavelength of 450-microns. Since the confusion limit is lower at this wavelength, which is shorter than other wavelengths used, these data will be able to (i) measure the more typical sources contributing to the sub-millimeter background, (ii) measure fluxes close to the rest wavelength peak of the blackbody distribution, and (iii) obtain much more accurate positions for the sources. Combining the sub-millimeter data with radio, infrared, optical, and X-ray data, from space and from the ground, will determine the multi-wavelength properties of the distant, heavily dust-obscured sources, and provide accurate positions for spectroscopic follow-up. The research will determine redshifts, luminosities, and star formation rates, and thus trace the extent and evolution of obscured star formation in the distant Universe.<br/><br/>Understanding the star formation history of the universe is a major goal of modern astronomy, and of great public interest. This research will inform popular science articles, web sites, and frequent talks to broad sections of the technical and lay communities. Previous data collected by these investigators have been made available to the community and have proved valuable for many outside projects: this practice of regular release will continue with the new survey data. Both investigators continue to promote diversity and cultural interaction at their respective institutions, including students from throughout the Pacific arena (in Hawaii), and a strong effort to involve women (in Wisconsin), who remain a vastly under-represented group.

Objectives include: finding and describing phases with topological order, where quasiparticle excitations do not have the quantum numbers of the electron, rather they are fractionalized; deriving exact results for particles with non-abelian braiding, where the physics depends on not only which particles are interchanged, but also the order in which they are interchanged; discovering and describing quantum critical points which separate novel phases from phases with conventional order; probing deeply the symmetry structure of one- and two-dimensional models of strongly correlated electrons, in particular the interplay between different competing orders; using integrable field theory in quantum impurity problems, to describe, for example, the observed destruction of coherence by extremely dilute magnetic impurities.<br/><br/>One method utilized will be field theory, especially non-perturbative methods useful for understanding novel phases which cannot be approached by conventional methods. Other methods used include integrability and supersymmetry, which are symmetries making exact computations possible in strongly-correlated systems.<br/><br/>This award supports undergraduate, graduate, and post doctoral education at the interface of theoretical condensed matter physics and mathematics.<br/><br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>The Division of Materials Research and the Division of Mathematical Sciences contribute funding to this award under the NSF-wide Mathematical Sciences Priority Area. This award supports fundamental theoretical research and education in condensed matter physics aimed at discovering and understanding new states of matter and transformations among them. This research lies at the interface of theoretical physics and mathematics and often involves synergistically advancing theoretical condensed physics and mathematics in parallel. <br/><br/>The PI focuses on electrons confined to two-dimensions in a strong magnetic field. Exotic states of matter known are known to exist; the area is ripe for the discovery of more new phases. There is substantial evidence that exotic phases also occur in materials in which the alignment of atomic-scale magnets to produce magnetism on the human scale is frustrated often because of the geometric configuration of the atomic-scale magnets on the nanometer scale. One motivation to seek these new phases of matter is to find a system capable of becoming a topological quantum computer. Such a computer could perform certain operations much faster than any currently existing computer. Other unforeseen technologies may also arise. Another motivation is a fundamental understanding of the physical world around whether or not it leads to new technologies, not yet even imagined. The quest leads to the synergistic advance of theoretical condensed matter physics and mathematics.

However, at the present time people who are unable to see or unable to use a mouse miss out on this unique experience, though it could benefit them the most. Second Life currently has more than 6 million residents and is growing fast. Although there are certainly ethical, legal and financial justifications for developing an accessible client to this environment, the PI's goal is to improve the quality of life for millions of people in the United States with disabilities of the types mentioned above. In this exploratory project, he will develop a prototype client for Second Life that offers a basic level of accessibility, and which will allow him to assess the feasibility of and technical requirements for a client that is fully accessible to blind players. The prototype client will initially allow blind players to navigate the environment using voice commands alone; it will then be enhanced and extended, as time and resources allow, so as to enable these players to interact in meaningful ways with other players. Achieving these objectives is not straightforward, because the client and server of Second Life have only recently been made open source and no one has yet attempted to create an accessible client for the environment. The PI has identified a number of issues that need to be investigated and resolved, including how to extract relevant information from the environment in order to provide meaningful output. This funding will allow the PI to explore alternative strategies in this regard, and also to run accessibility studies with the basic client in order to identify other problems. The open source community is slowly starting to add new features to Second Life; the PI's experience with the basic client may allow him to make timely recommendations (e.g., objects descriptions may need to be much richer than they are now, to better accommodate an accessible client). <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The technology developed in this project can be leveraged to other massive multiplayer online games (such as the popular World of Warcraft), not to mention games in general. Voice navigation can make first person shooters or 3D adventure games accessible to physically disabled players. The PI will take advantage of his experiences in this project to contribute to the formulation of accessibility guidelines for games, similar in spirit to those developed by the W3C for websites, which will enable future games to be developed in an inclusive way for the benefit of all members of society.

Beratan of Duke University is supported by the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to design, analyze and interpret inelastic electron-transfer kinetics in molecules with bridge-localized vibrational modes. He is developing interpretive and predictive descriptions of intramolecular inelastic electron-tunneling in a variety of molecules containing an electron donor, a rigid bridge, and an electron acceptor. This work is in collaboration with the experimental group of Rubtsov at Tulane to examine analogies between the double slit electron transmission experiment and the molecular electron-transfer problem. The goal is to define new schemes to control electron transfer and to develop approaches to manipulate the strength of molecule-mediated electronic coupling. This work is having a broad impact in developing intuition that may lead to applications in optical communication and solar energy harvesting. The PI is promoting science education by providing summer research opportunities to economically disadvantaged and historically underrepresented groups. A new course cluster for first-year students is under development to examine the fundamental philosophical foundations of science.

Properties of ecosystems constrain the range of possible pathways for agricultural intensification, and the nature of agricultural production can influence aspects of human societies. At the same time, human societies create and develop specific systems of agricultural production that transform ecosystems, sometimes in dramatic ways. The Hawaiian Archipelago offers excellent opportunities to explore the nature and consequences of interactions among ecosystems, agricultural systems, and human societies as they played out over centuries prior to European contact. This collaborative research project will focus on intensive agriculture and society in Kohala, Hawai'i, where broad and well-defined environmental gradients encompass a large (60 km-square) and long-sustained rain-fed dryland agricultural system that was abandoned in the mid-19th century. With participation from local communities and schools, experimental gardens will be established across the range of the field system. This effort will draw on community input (traditional knowledge), archaeological observations, and ecosystem/soil analyses in addition to agricultural experimentation. Once in place, these gardens will be used to develop physiologically based agricultural crop models and to determine how the agricultural system was organized and integrated; how it was sustained for centuries prior to European contact; and how it interacted with nearby irrigated systems. This last effort will make use of strong differences in the abundances of multiple stable isotopes across the broad environmental gradient of Kohala.<br/><br/>The establishment of experimental gardens within the boundaries of the ancient and long-abandoned Kohala field system will serve several scientific and educational objectives. A well-validated crop model for dryland crops will allow much more detailed calculations of agricultural yields; these in turn will make existing models of past agricultural production and human demography across the Kohala landscape more realistic. Similarly, isotopic measurements of Hawaiian crops will support detailed interpretations of sources of food and other goods as these varied over space, time, and the social status of households in pre-contact Hawai'i. Together these efforts will make it possible to determine how this and other large, rain-fed agricultural systems functioned and how they interacted with nearby communities based on irrigated agriculture. The project therefore will contribute to understanding the evolution of complex societies. The gardens represent an extraordinary educational resource because they will make a step toward restoring an example of the main pre-contact agricultural system on the island of Hawai'i. School and community groups will make use of these gardens to learn science by conducting field experiments in a culturally meaningful setting. This project is supported by an award resulting from the NSF competition focusing on the Dynamics of Coupled Natural and Human Systems.

Despite this critical importance in disease transmission, our understanding of the hormones in ticks and their role in development, reproduction and disease transmission is in its infancy. For example, only one hormone has been studied in ticks, a hormone that regulates egg production. Ticks feed exclusively on blood throughout their entire life and, because of this unusual life style, they have developed unique, but poorly understood, ways to control their development. The major goal of this research is to identify the hormones produced by the tick brain and its associated glands and at the same time to examine the role of the brain and genes expressed by the brain in the regulation of female egg development and reproduction. This project includes studies aimed at understanding how the male uses protein secretions in its semen to regulate the female brain and initiate female egg production. These studies will be conducted by examining global gene expression in female tick brains and identifying the genes in male ticks that encode for pheromones that regulate female development. The broad impacts of this work include (a) increasing our understanding of tick biochemistry and function as compared to insects and related organisms; (b) greatly advancing our understanding of tick hormones, pheromones, brain function and the evolution of blood feeding; (c) providing brain gene microarrays to the scientific community that can be used to further advance the study of neurobiology in ticks and other organisms; and (d) provide new methods for the control of ticks and tick borne diseases. This interdisciplinary project will be conducted between two universities and involve four different research laboratories providing a unique training experience for undergraduate/graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in molecular biology, genomics, proteomics and physiology. In addition, these labs have an established track record of technology transfer to the private sector and the development of practical solutions to human problems.

Unfortunately, the traditional strict layering design approach is no longer effective in wireless ad hoc networks, particularly in the mobile ad hoc networks, and fails to achieve the desired flexibility. Thus, cross-layer network design becomes much more important than ever and should be investigated thoroughly. <br/>In this project, the PI carefully selects three research tasks ? joint design of flow/congestion control and medium access control, active collaborative relaying, and opportunistic medium access control and auto rate control ? to demonstrate how cross-layer design should be done and how this design could improve the performance. In all these problems, the medium access control (MAC) layer acts as the anchor point to extract the needed information about the wireless environment to be used for other layers. In so doing, network protocols can be made more adaptive and responsive. <br/>It is expected that cross-layer design methodology can be significantly advanced through this research. Moreover, the basic ideas and the cross-layer design methodology introduced in this research open a new avenue to the design of efficient network protocols and the proposed technologies could be easily incorporated into the commercial products, and hence will have significant economic impact on the telecommunication industries. Finally, any research outcome of cross-layer design can be easily incorporated into wireless network courses that train the future work force.

To this end, Jack Johnson will examine various types of sediments in two drainage basins in the northern desert coast of Peru to identify local ENSO-caused landscape changes over the last several thousand years. He will then use luminescence methods to obtain ages for these sediments under the supervision of Dr. James K. Feathers to build an extensive picture of the timing, frequency, and magnitude of these events in each area. This picture will then be compared with a wide range of published archaeological data on prehistoric Peruvian economies to assess the potential impacts of fluctuations in ENSO activity on the economic infrastructure of the prehistoric societies that inhabited the area.<br/><br/> Research of this nature is important for several reasons. First, it will improve scientific understanding of past variations in ENSO activity in Peru, and this will in turn provide both geographic and temporal perspective to efforts to understand both ancient and modern fluctuations in ENSO events around the world. Second, this research will help give similar perspective to the long-term economic threats these events pose to Peruvians, and it will therefore help inform local public efforts to mitigate the billions of dollars in damages that these events can cause through massive erosion of soils and infrastructure. Third, the combination of data on ENSO activity and the uniquely rich archaeological record of the area can provide a detailed illustration as to how human groups deal with climatic events over the long term. Such insight will be invaluable to researchers interested specifically in the prehistory of the Andes, as well as those more generally interested in evaluating modern global challenges posed by the impacts of acute climatic fluctuations on elaborate economic webs.<br/><br/> In broader terms, this project will also help integrate various communities of researchers and citizens with an interest in the archaeological record and archaeological methods. Peruvian archaeologists and geologists will be engaged in fieldwork and will be trained in the field collection of samples for luminescence dating, a technique for which expertise is lacking amongst Peruvian academics. Peruvian and American students, including two full-time field assistants, will be trained in field sediment analysis and in luminescence methods. Presentations and lectures on this research will be given in multiple forums in both the United States and Peru, including professional conferences, primary schools, and community meetings. All conclusions will be published in peer-reviewed journals in both English and Spanish, and all data will be archived online in both English and Spanish for public access by any researcher with an interest in climate data, chronometric data, or archaeological data. Lastly, this project will provide training and advancement towards a doctoral degree for Jack Johnson.

This collaborative research project will investigate the intersection of Islamism and capitalism and its geopolitical and cultural implications through a multi-sited case study of the new Turkish veiling-fashion industry and its transnational connections to Berlin, Paris and Amsterdam. Turkish producers of veiling-fashion, which is fashionable Islamic dress for women, have begun to export their products to retail outlets in the Middle East, Europe, and North America. The investigators will analyze the scope, history, and geography of the veiling-fashion industry headquartered in Turkey by tracing out the circuits of production, design, sales, and finance that characterize the industry. They also will explore the implications of the production, sale, and consumption of veiling-fashion for geopolitics, geoeconomics, and identity formation in a transnational context. The investigators will employ a multi-method research design with four components: (1) a survey of the veiling-fashion industry in Turkey; (2) interview-based case studies of three transnational veiling-fashion companies (Tekbir, Aydan, and Dicle); (3) focus groups with consumers of Turkish veiling-fashion in Istanbul, Paris, Berlin, and Amsterdam; and (4) the production and analysis of a veiling-fashion archive of catalogues, brochures, advertisements, company reports, and fashion shows.<br/><br/>This research project will provide an empirically grounded assessment of the effects of transnational Islamic businesses and the rise of veiling-fashion amongst Muslim women in contemporary Europe and Turkey. More broadly, project results will illuminate the geopolitical and geoeconomic implications of the transnationalization of Islamic practices and identities. The project will focus on the structure and dynamics of the veiling-fashion industry and the role of Islamic business practices, economic governance, and workplace regulations at each stage in the global commodity chain. Through the analysis of how the production and consumption of veiling-fashion has become entwined with political and cultural identities in Turkey and in Europe, this research will provide new understanding of critical issues, including questions of migration, the regulation of public veiling, and the transnationalization of Muslim identities, that now are at stake in Turkey, Europe, and other parts of the world.

In particular, using machine learning to model gene <br/>regulatory networks---the switching on and off of genes by regulatory <br/>proteins that bind to non-coding DNA---has emerged as a central <br/>problem in systems biology. Now, an explosion of new high-throughput <br/>technologies for measuring physical interactions between proteins and <br/>between protein and DNA provides a new data integration challenge for <br/>computational modeling of gene regulation. These new data can all be <br/>viewed as graph-structured data, or physical interaction networks.<br/><br/>The central computational goal of this project is to develop new <br/>machine learning learning algorithms for exploiting graph-structured <br/>data, including: (1) boosting with efficient graph mining; (2) graph <br/>kernels based on subgraph histogramming; and (3) information-based <br/>graph partitioning. These new algorithms will be used to integrate <br/>physical interaction network data into models of gene regulation in <br/>order to better represent underlying biological mechanisms. The <br/>focus will be two fundamental modeling problems: inferring signal <br/>transduction pathways and modeling cis regulatory modules at the <br/>level of DNA sequence and interacting regulatory proteins. The <br/>algorithms will be applied both to publicly available data and to <br/>primary gene expression data provided by one of the investigators to <br/>study the hypoxia in yeast and the response to environmental toxins <br/>in mammalian neural cells.<br/><br/>This project will learn systems-level models that lead to new insight <br/>into the underlying mechanisms of gene regulation and open the way to <br/>broader biological discoveries. All data, results and source code <br/>will be publicly available via the Web (http://www.cs.columbia.edu/ <br/>compbio/cellular-networks) and disseminated through courses and <br/>bioinformatics software packages. The project will also create <br/>undergraduate research opportunities for joint dry and wet lab <br/>projects and outreach activities to introduce New York City public <br/>high school students to new interdisciplinary areas of science.

Anti-inflammatory treatment of human spinal core injury and its<br/>timing must be based on knowledge of the types of cells participating in the inflammatory response, the time after injury when they appear and the nature of their actions. However, inflammatory cascades and relationship with neurogenesis are complicated and consequence of central nervous system injury including spinal cord injury is poorly understood. Invading macrophages and resident microglia cells, the two major cell types that are from monocytic lineage play major role in the inflammatory process. Due to the lack of specific markers, the functional roles of invading macrophages from activated microglia within injured<br/>spinal cord are not largely unknown. We propose to use microarray techniques to investigate expression profiles on microglia and macrophages in different time points and the expression network between inflammation and neurogenesis. New methods are proposed to label defined cell populations in microglia/macrophage deleted mice. New statistical techniques will be developed to address directly the<br/>challenges from our biological studies. These include removing intensity effect of the Affymetrix data, identifying significant genes and determining gene expressions patterns over time, identifying a small group of genes that differentiate invading macrophages from activated microglia in the spinal cord, among others. They involve the statistical estimation, testing, variable selection, classification and network modeling in high-dimensional feature spaces. These emerging problems will be confronted via developing new statistical methods to address the challenges associated with high-dimensionality. At the same time, the investigators also intend to provide fundamental understanding, via asymptotic analysis and simulation studies, to these problems and their associated methodologies. A distinguished feature of the proposal is the combination the strengths of our expertise in statistics and molecular biology to gain better understanding of molecular<br/>disturbances in spinal cord and central nervous system injury.<br/><br/>The proposal investigates molecular disturbances in spinal cord and central nervous system injury. Our aims include identifying genes that reveal the distinct functional profiles of resident microglia and invading macrophages in spinal cord injury, and selecting the genes that are uniquely altered during specific facets of the neuronal response to inflammation. These approaches can not only help us understand the molecular mechanisms of inflammatory responses in spinal cord injury, but also potentially identify genes to be targeted for therapeutic intervention following spinal core injury. In addition, our developed cutting-edging statistical techniques and bioinformatic tools can be applied to other biological and statistical researches. The project will also integrate research and education by working closely with students and funding them in the form of research assistantships, creating datasets, and developing publicly available computer code (both made available through the web) for each of the main research endeavors funded by this proposal. Various research findings and examples will be simplified and taught in both undergraduate and graduate courses.<br/>In particular, they will be used in supervising undergraduate senior theses and Ph.D. theses. Postdoctoral fellows and underrepresented groups will be trained as a part of our research investigation. The results will be disseminated broadly through presentations at seminars, conferences, professional association meetings, and internet.

Unlike the Internet where heterogeneity is normally addressed for the sake of functional interoperability, CPS systems are normally regarded as special-purpose systems of systems, designed mostly for critical infrastructures that require global regulation and performance assurance. Therefore, heterogeneity must be addressed not only for the sake of functional interoperability, but also for policy regulation and performance assurance.<br/>To address functional interoperability, a distributed framework, called the CPS-Bus, is proposed to flexibly interconnect different CPS subsystems. To support policy regulation, a policy specification language is developed to regulate the relationship between context, operation and rules. To achieve performance assurance over heterogeneous subsystems, a novel run-time combination of reflective interfaces and a distributed control framework is invented to address evolving performance dynamics and required on-demand functional (compositional) changes. This work will allow the effective interconnection of computation and physical processes to reveal the useful correlations among different phenomena and to conduct effective control across the boundary of CPS subsystems. For developers, this work will significantly reduce the design and development costs for building CPS systems. For end users, the resultant CPS systems will lead to exciting applications such as assisted living that will fundamentally improve the quality of every-day life.

It faces three challenges: to compile sufficient data, to integrate multiple databases, and to maintain tools that can assemble all the local data records into a geologic time line. The third challenge amounts to sequencing the fossil record and we propose to address three of the obstacles it faces: (1) Fossil biotas of the same age may differ as a result of habitat and preservation effects; (2) Very large data sets must be sequenced in smaller pieces and the results stitched seamlessly together; (3) Increasing numbers of dated and fingerprinted ash beds need to used more effectively. We propose a case study of manageable geographic and temporal extent that, nevertheless, raises these same issues. The Ordovician and Silurian periods span almost 100 million years of early Paleozoic time and are traditionally subdivided by graptolites and conodonts - two fossil clades with different ecological and preservational traits that restrict their use to largely mutually exclusive domains. The Mohawkian (Late Ordovician) of eastern North America presents precisely the type of challenging geological environment in which to build and test the temporal sequencing and stitching approaches that we envision. Mohawkian strata are widely exposed in the region and yield a rich fossil record that includes diverse, but somewhat endemic, conodont faunas. The epicratonic succession is rimmed along the Appalachian margin by deeper water sediments of the Taconic foreland basin. These strata contain a suite of inter-continentally distributed graptolite faunas, but few described conodont assemblages. Numerous altered volcanic ash deposits (K-bentonites) link these facies through a set of transitional facies along the interior basin margin. Despite these advantages, the prevalence of short sections, structural complexity, and facies limitation of the faunas impedes precise and reliable correlation between the cratonic and basinal successions, consequently limiting our ability to compare their disparate faunas and tectonic histories.<br/>Intellectual Merit: We propose to combine (1) geochemical fingerprinting (tephrochronology) and<br/>U-Pb geochronology of K-bentonites from the Mohawkian and early Cincinnatian with (2) a restudy of late Mohawkian conodonts and graptolites from eleven regions across eastern North America and (3) computer assisted sequencing of the global Ordovician conodont and graptolite fossil record. This work will provide a detailed temporal and paleoecological framework within which to refine the application of biofacies information to the temporal sequencing of the fossil record via rigorous quantitative techniques. We will focus in steps 1 and 2 particularly on conodont and graptolite-bearing successions that contain Kbentonites, and especially on regions where conodonts and graptolites occur in close association. The results of our work in a time interval that remains troublesome in spite of a wide range of timestratigraphic information will bear upon fundamental questions in both local and global stratigraphy. In the course of this study we will test existing alternate correlation models for the mid Upper Ordovician of central and eastern North America. The results will provide an improved, age-calibrated basis for studies of faunal turnover and diversity change in the Ordovician and Silurian. Most importantly, the work will lead to the development of improved techniques for time scale construction and validation.<br/>Broader Impact: The data and tools we develop will be shared immediately through the CHRONOS<br/>project and will investigate technological solutions that are not being addressed by CHRONOS to<br/>sequence events. The project meets the EARTHTIME goal of cross-training stratigraphers and<br/>geochronologists in developing high precision time-scales. We will train two PhD students (one a<br/>minority), and three undergraduates. We will integrate the efforts of four institutions, two with large<br/>minority enrolment (UCR, UALR), in a new collaboration that will facilitate the interaction of all the<br/>students and PIs at each institution. Undergraduates will participate as field and lab assistants for the PIs and for the graduate students, and will be given pieces of the project as senior research projects. Each student will present aspects of the research at a professional meeting. The project will also include a secondary school teacher who will work alongside PI Leslie during the summer as part of the Arkansas STRIVE program. The teacher will develop class projects based on their experiences. The project thus impacts future generations of students by enhancing a secondary education teacher's knowledge base and scientific curriculum.

Determining whether fundamental constants vary is a frontier study both in modern cosmology and in particle physics. The aim is both to increase the sensitivity of such measurements by a factor of three to five, and to increase the range of cosmic times over which determinations can be made. This involves a search for new, highly-redshifted molecular absorbers, and their use to determine, or set limits on, the rate of change of the fine structure constant, the proton gyromagnetic ratio, and the ratio of proton mass to electron mass. The methodology, focusing on the use of the conjugate lines of the OH molecule, offers significant advantages compared to other approaches, such as more accurate frequency calibration and minimizing systematic errors due to relative gas motion of different species. As well as considering secular changes in physical constants, this work will measure the molecular gas mass as a function of redshift, make in-situ measurements of the Cosmic Microwave Background temperature, find new examples of compact symmetric radio galaxies, test the radio-loud model for Active Galactic Nuclei, and determine the changing physical conditions in star-forming molecular clouds over cosmic time.<br/><br/>In addition to training a new generation of radio astronomers in observing techniques at both the high- and low-frequency ends of the radio spectrum, this study includes developing a planetarium talk, an undergraduate introductory module, and an Aspen workshop, on the implications of the research.

Domestic Politics and Signaling Long Term Resolve in International Crises	SES	POLITICAL SCIENCE	08/01/2007	08/05/2007	Glenn Palmer	PA	Pennsylvania State Univ University Park	Standard Grant	Brian D. Humes	07/31/2008	$6,248.00		gpalmer@psu.edu	110 Technology Center Building	UNIVERSITY PARK	PA	168027000	8148651372	SBE	1371	9179, SMET	$0.00	Scholars have long emphasized the importance of resolve in international crises. However, the literature to date has largely focused on the intent to use force. This project seeks to shift the focus of arguments about resolve from the willingness to make good on one's threats to the willingness to bear the costs of a prolonged conflict. This produces new insights into the process of crisis bargaining, with implications for which conflicts are likely to escalate to higher levels of violence as well as the expected outcome of the conflict should it escalate.<br/><br/>Domestic politics serves as a useful indicator of when states are likely to be willing to bear the costs of sustained fighting. In democratic states, the behavior of the primary political opposition has a large impact on the costs a state is willing to suffer in war. Opposition parties will often support the government in the early stages of a crisis, even if they have every intention of withdrawing their support later. If they do oppose the conflict, the government faces a far greater risk of punishment for failure. A fear of future opposition could force governments to accept settlements early in conflicts, while they are still supported by the opposition, rather than risking continued fighting in hopes of better terms of settlement. Therefore, governments are more likely to end their wars if the opposition is currently supporting the conflict but that support is tenuous. On the other hand, once the opposition does oppose a conflict, governments actually become more likely to keep fighting, as their political fates are now more closely tied to the outcome of the conflict and they are forced to take bigger risks to avoid failure. <br/><br/>To assess these claims, a dataset will be compiled on the wartime position of the primary opposition party(ies) for interstate wars involving established democracies. Data will also be collected on battle fatalities over time within these wars. Using event history analysis, the effects of opposition behavior and facts on the ground on the duration and outcome of war will be estimated. <br/><br/>This project will produce useful data that can be used by other researchers to answer other important questions, such as what factors determine whether a war will be opposed, the effect of opposition on public opinion and electoral outcomes, and what factors determine changes in the relative rates of casualties. The results of the analysis here will be important, as they may help us better explain why democratic leaders often choose to continue fighting unpopular wars (as did the US in Vietnam and currently in Iraq) and why democratic leaders often end popular and successful wars early, when they could have pressed the enemy further (as did the US in the Persian Gulf War). This will help us understand the politics of war, and shed light on why leaders cling to failing policies in general.

Whitmore	07/31/2012	$225,000.00	Reina Maruyama	karsten.heeger@yale.edu	21 North Park Street	MADISON	WI	537151218	6082623822	MPS	7694	0000, OTHR	$0.00	This proposal addresses two fundamental questions in neutrino physics: Are neutrinos Majorana or Dirac particles, and what is the absolute neutrino mass? The only practical experimental technique currently available to address the first question is to search for neutrinoless double beta decay; the second can be answered by measuring the distortion near the endpoint of a single beta decay energy spectrum. A limited number of technologies are available to investigate these questions and cryogenic bolometers is the only detection method that may offer answers to both.<br/><br/>The proposed research will investigate ways to improve on the sensitivity levels achievable with current bolometers for neutrino experiments. Specifically, we will pursue studies to understand and discriminate sources of radioactive backgrounds by making use of multiple signal characteristics available from bolometers such as heat and scintillation. In addition, R&D on the signal extraction from bolometers will be carried out to improve the detector speed. The readout and scalability of microcalorimeters is crucial for the next generation of direct neutrino mass measurement using bolometers.<br/><br/>Cryogenic bolometers are being used extensively in astronomy and astrophysics research. They have also found application in a few neutrino experiments (double beta decay and single beta decay endpoint mass measurements), but the expertise currently resides mostly in Europe. The research proposed here will help develop the expertise of this promising technology in the neutrino community so that we are ready to pursue sensitive neutrino mass and/or double beta decay experiments using bolometers when DUSEL becomes available.

In prior work supported by NSF, the PI developed a formally exact diagrammatic kinetic theory of liquids that led to a useful picture of dynamics on various time scales. In the current work, he is extending this method to look at temperatures below the critical temperature of mode coupling theory. The singularity which arises in mode coupling theory at that temperature might be an artifact of the theory and may have no relation to the true glass transition. <br/><br/>This research will shed light on an important phase transition that occurs in glasses, of which proteins are an interesting example. It is expected to add to the body of techniques available for stimulating complex systems, and may open ways to treat the behavior of systems as complex as a biological cell, thus having a broad impact on a number of fields of science.

The goal here is to understand science in spin-based nano-fabricated structures by probing the quantum states and dynamics of spins on nano-sized islands, laying the foundation for a new generation of ultra-fast and non-volatile electronics. This program begins with the fabrication of simple nanostructures based on proven single-electron transistor architecture and processing, with ferromagnetic electrode(s) to inject polarized spins. These new nanoscale hybrid structures will be used to test various theoretically predicted phenomena such as enhanced magnetoresistance, single-electron charging effects, conductance oscillations, and spin diffusion. One of the novel features of this effort is to inject fully polarized spins into nonmagnetic materials such as carbon nanotubes, nonmagnetic metals, and superconductors, by spin filtering through the use of a magnetic semiconductor. Ultimately, the localization of a single-electron of controlled spin in a highly sensitive nanostructure will enable novel and more versatile spin-based devices, which so far is being pursued based on the behavior of large numbers of spin-polarized electrons. This program represents an excellent opportunity for the students (of all levels) involved being educated in the nanoscience; participate in a true team effort with complementary and collective goals. The students will work in multidisciplinary areas - physics, materials science, and nano-devices, getting trained and educated in the spin-based research laying the foundation for future technology, which is already in short supply in the U.S. <br/>%%%<br/>The recognition of electron spin as a binary variable analogous to its charge as currently used in semiconductors, opened new fields of science and technology that have already led to commercial devices, called spin electronics. This interdisciplinary team will address the underlying fundamental science and engineering research issues that are critical to the emerging field of nanoscale spin electronics (also called as spintronics). In spite of the recent progress and potentially promising for applications, the field of spintronics just beginning to unravel, (remains largely unexplored) and requires extensive research efforts. The proposed research (elucidating spin transport including spin tunneling and injection from a ferromagnet into a nonmagnetic metal, superconductor or a semiconductor) holds great promise for nanoscale science and future information technology. This aim is supported by the investigation of promising new materials combinations for spin transport and the development of powerful, innovative probes of spin dynamics in nanostructures. This team, with complementary knowledge and expertise - of physicists, material scientists and electrical engineers, will efficiently address all the issues from the conceptual level to the near-device stage. The proposed program will ultimately lead to novel spin electronic devices that meet the criteria for low power, broadband, and ultra high density including extremely powerful computers. Many PhD students, and importantly undergraduates and high school students will take part in this program under the guidance of the PIs and postdoctoral fellows. The training will generate future scientists and engineers in high demands in the area of nano-science and spin-based information technology to maintain the future technological prowess of the country, critically necessary for the national security. <br/>***

AIP retains much of the elegance and simplicity of <br/>IP, but is far better equipped to thwart malicious adversaries. To <br/>provide this protection, AIP incorporates three kinds of <br/>accountability: source accountability, control-plane accountability, <br/>and dataplane accountability. Together, these three forms of <br/>accountability ensure that any host, router, and autonomous network <br/>can identify misbehaving components.<br/><br/>Operationally, this results in: an Internet in which any spoofing or <br/>forgery of source addresses is detectable (from source <br/>accountability); a partial defense against flooding attacks from <br/>compromised hosts (also from source accountability); an Internet <br/>where route hijacking and other security compromises to inter-domain <br/>routing are impossible (from control-plane accountability); and the <br/>ability for end hosts and operators to pinpoint locations where <br/>packets are being lost or excessively delayed even when the problems <br/>are in other networks (from data-plane accountability).<br/><br/>The cornerstone of AIP is its use of a self-certifying address <br/>format. All AIP addresses are of the form AD:EID, where AD is the <br/>identifier for the autonomous domain that the host belongs to, and <br/>EID is a globally unique host identifier. Both address components are <br/>derived from public keys held by the domain and host, respectively, <br/>allowing other entities to verify the authenticity and provenance of <br/>packets and messages. AIP's self-certifying addressing allows simple <br/>protocols to realize the above benefits.

Methods that have had success in this domain impose constraints on models incorporating notions of simplicity, smoothness, or robustness. The constraints are often formalized either as priors for Bayesian methods or as geometric criteria for machine learning methods. The heart of this proposal is to develop and relate the importance of the geometry underlying the data to probabilistic modeling. The specific research foci of the proposal are: 1) The exploitation of geometric assumptions for problems of model uncertainty and variable selection in high-dimensional models; 2) A Bayesian framework for the use of ancillary or unlabeled data in predictive modeling; 3) Theory, methods and computation for nonparametric Bayesian kernel models; 4) Novel methods for nonlinear dimension reduction for high-dimensional data from regularization and geometric perspectives.<br/><br/>The proposal develops theory, methods and computational tools for statistical modeling motivated by applications in functional genomics. Modern molecular biology has generated data of a rapidly escalating scale and complexity -- high-throughput genomics data, genetic and sequence information, proteomic and metabolomic data, and other forms of more traditional biomedical or clinical information. Modeling this data for predictive phenotypes of prognosis, diagnosis, and pathway deregulation as well as understanding relevant variables and their associations are fundamental challenges for modern statistics, machine learning, and data-mining research. These methodological developments will have impact on several other scientific areas including biology, engineering, environmental and health science, and social sciences.

A model seminar curriculum developed by a team of professional ethicists and GIS&T educators will be developed and disseminated freely to the GIS&T education community in the U.S. and overseas. This project addresses the fact that GIS&T is a large and rapidly-growing multidisciplinary field concerned with the nature, use, and societal impacts of information derived from geospatial technologoes. Technologies such as the Global Positioning System (GPS), satellite remote sensing, and geographic information systems (GIS) enable analysts to track people and tehings, to evaluate natural resources and monitor land uses, to identify optimal sites and routes, and to target areas for further investigation or intervention. As such, ethical issues related to: 1) privacy of individuals and use of geospatial technologies as surveillance tools; 2) appropriate use of data collected using these methods for policy decisions; and, 3) consequences of inequities that arise through biased access to geospatial tools and derived data. A panel of ethicists and educators will be convened to develop a seminar curriculum that engages students in the philosophical foundations of ethics, in echniques for assessing and strengthening moral reasoning ability, and the ethical issues associated with GIS&T. Student interactions with GIS&T professionals will be used to develop case studies that illuminate practical situations and professional responses to them. The curriculum will be widely disseminated through the Association of American Geographers and through virtual seminars at PSU.

The PIs' prior work in brain-computer interfaces based on functional near-infrared (fNIR) imaging has shown great promise for restoring communication and environmental control to people with such disabilities. Currently, typical control interfaces for these systems are simple discrete selection paradigms, which have proven to be effective but limited in information throughput rates. Innovative control interfaces based on continuous control paradigms, which dynamically map brain signal levels to control signals, have not been adequately studied for fNIR imaging. Depending upon the extent to which brain signals can be effectively mapped to continuous control, adding this feature to existing discrete control could significantly increase the range of tasks that can be performed by users of an fNIR-based direct brain interface (e.g., positional selection or 2-D drawing). In this work, the PIs will explore innovative direct brain-computer interfaces for continuous control and use them to develop applications for creative expression. For people with severe motor disabilities, creative expression can provide an emotional outlet as well as mental exercise to improve quality of life. The tasks inherent in creating visual art, such as drawing, coloring, and texturing, cannot be accomplished with discrete controls. Therefore, visual art provides an ideal experimental platform to study fNIR-based continuous control interfaces. It also provides an engaging and motivating platform for training that will improve users' abilities to control a direct brain interface. To these ends, the PIs will study non-traditional control interfaces for continuous and discrete selection such as wheels, dials, and gauges, to determine to what extent fNIR signals can be mapped to continuous control. The PIs will explore continuous methods for selection and control of art media such as brushes, colors, textures, and shapes, and investigate to what extent continuous brain signals can be translated into visual art gestures (drawing, shading, coloring). The advice of a professional, internationally-known artist who has ALS will guide the user requirements of the control interfaces. Quantitative and qualitative user performance data will be collected, and will among other things be used to compare learning effects with a visual art paradigm against traditional, discrete selection exercises to determine if training time and performance can be improved. Project outcomes will add to the body of knowledge for assistive technology and human-computer interfaces.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: Methods for translating cortical oxygenation signals into continuous control signals for user interfaces will have mainstream applications for assistive technologies by essentially smoothing noisy input signals. Such developments could be applied for use by those with reduced motor coordination, including the elderly, young children, and those with motor diseases such as Parkinson's disease. Mainstream users may benefit from a hands-free interface, and neural control could provide added dimensions to the creative process.

The requested instrumentation, a large system for production (Netezza Performance Server(s)), are to be housed at Howard and Sandia National Lab and serve scientific projects on DNA binding mechanisms, protein structure prediction, data mining for computational science at Sandia, multi-dimensional visualization at SUNY-Buffalo, and natural language processing at NMSU. The work responds to the data deluge/tsunami/explosion/avalanche<br/>that presently overwhelms the scientific community. The data intensive computer resource, National Terabyte Data Analysis Centers (NTDAC), provides the ability to analyze tera-scale data sets 10 to 100 times faster than current alternatives at a lower cost. Over time, NTDAC is expected to house and analyze peta-bytes of raw data, to have back-up and support capabilities, and to use parallel relational data warehouse appliance technology that is orders of magnitude faster and easier to use. The initial focus, exploitation of massively parallel relational database appliance technology, enables solution problems in computational biology, chemistry, physics, text mining, bibliographic coupling, and natural language processing.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: The infrastructure benefits all areas of science through faster data analysis. The interrogation of massive data sets allows practitioners and students to deliver/gain new knowledge at a more rapid pace, and to create needed solutions. Moreover, the institution is an HBCU, where minority students are likely to gain from the experience.

An outgrowth of the WPI-developed ?ASSISTments Systems for Math?, and REC-funded ?Modeling Across the Curriculum?, the proposal?s main goal is to develop a rigorous, technology-based system for middle school standards-aligned assessment of inquiry skills (i.e., interpreting data, formulating hypotheses and predictions, conducting experiments, collecting data, mathematizing, and communicating and defending hypotheses) in six physical science content areas (i.e., Properties of Matter; Elements, Compounds, and Mixtures; Motion of Objects; Forms of Energy; and Heat Energy). Assessments will be aligned with the Massachusetts Curricular Framework and the National Science Education Standards. <br/><br/>The innovative aspect of this proposed effort resides in its intent to both assess students? inquiry skills and to provide students with intelligent, systematic (as opposed to guessing), and explicit tutoring, providing feedback on their choices as they work with computer-based manipulative models (microworlds), thus increasing their science learning. Participants include students and teachers from the Worcester Public School System, characterized by its diverse ethnic and SES student population. <br/><br/>Five research questions drive this research: (1) Does inquiry tutoring lead to improved inquiry skills?, (2) Does inquiry tutoring lead to increased content learning as measured by the State?s assessment system?, (3) What is the relationship of students? epistemologies of models and their inquiry with models?, (4) Do inquiry skills transfer across the six science topics as measured by better inquiry skills in each of the six skills?, and (5) What is the relationship between inquiry as measured by students? logs, and content learning as measured by pre- and post-tests on content? <br/><br/>Anticipated products include (a) an intelligent tutoring system capable of assessing students? skills, and providing teachers with data by class and students by inquiry skill, and (b) a set of assessment items in six physical science areas. Evaluation will emphasize the overall development of the inquiry assessments and tutoring system in relation to content learning through multiple statistical methods. Dissemination includes conferences, publications in scholarly journals, and a website.

The instrument will consist of an inverted optical microscope modified to allow confocal imaging in a beam-scanning configuration. The microscope will be equipped with a photoelastic modulator for rapid polarization modulation, a pair of photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) for polarization-dependent SHG detection, and a pair of PMTs for polarization dependent two photon excited fluorescence (TPEF) detection. <br/><br/>This instrument will yield detailed polarization information and nanoscale structural information, obtained from molecular tensors and theoretical modeling. This instrument will be utilized initially to study cell wall construction (through cytoskeletal actin-myosin network dynamics) and deconstruction (enzymatic degradation of cellulosic materials for renewable energy) mechanisms. These efforts will capitalize on the chiral-specific activities of second harmonic generation (SHG), which allow for determination of absolute polar orientation and the degree of coparallel versus anti-parallel alignment within fibrous assemblies. This instrument will affect a broad range of research areas involving surfaces and interfaces.

A direct extrapolation and ad-hoc application of existing defect-tolerance (DT) and fault-tolerance (FT) techniques erodes much of the benefits of new technologies. The objective of this research is to develop a systematic framework for design and test of digital systems that optimizes a specified combination of cost, performance and power for nanometer technologies.<br/><br/>A framework for efficient application of existing and new DT and FT techniques, including the use of spares, task rescheduling, coding and DFM rules is being developed. This framework works in conjunction with existing design flows and includes components spanning the levels of technology (variations/defects), layout, circuit, logic, architecture and system. Key innovations are embodied in new techniques for identifying efficient ways of assigning spares, reconfiguring around faulty modules, and modifying selected parts of a module to improve yield. To obtain optimality, a design explorer is being developed to efficiently search the space of alternative designs. <br/>This research will provide the first framework for design of digital systems for the remaining years of CMOS scaling and beyond. We will train graduate and undergraduate students in this methodology of the future and share our results with academic and industrial colleagues. <br/><br/>This research will provide immense benefits to society by being a key enabler of an era of inexpensive and powerful digital devices with significant educational, health and security functions.

Fisheries, particularly those in the Arctic and sub-artic regions, exhibit a complex interplay of cultural, biological, political, and economic factors, which may not be suited to a single disciplinary investigation. One such fishery, that has experienced dramatic ecological and political changes over the course of the last century, is the Pacific Halibut (Hippoglosus stenolepis) fishery. This project will utilize a multi-sited and multi-methodological approach in order to investigate the history of the halibut fishery, surrounding the western region of Kodiak Island, Alaska. During the course of the project, the researcher will examine the complex interactions between the fishery, climate, and two groups who produce knowledge about the Pacific Halibut fishery: community members of Old Harbor, an Alaska Native fishing community on Kodiak Island, and the International Pacific Halibut Commission, the Seattle-based intergovernmental body that manages and conducts most of the scientific research on the fishery. Oral history methodologies, including interviews and participant observation, will be utilized to understand Old Harbor's history of the fishery and its role in the social and economic development of the region. In this way, the researcher hopes to gain insight into the historical and cultural context in which changes to the fishery take place.<br/><br/>In addition to the social-economic history of the Pacific Halibut fishery, the researcher will employ the technique of biochronology in order to develop a biological history of Pacific halibut growth in the Kodiak region. By examining the changing widths of increments found in halibut otoliths, the ways in which external factors such as climate, pollution, and exploitation act on fish populations will be reconstructed. Using the International Pacific Halibut Commission archived otoliths, a chronology will be built for approximately 100 years of growth. <br/><br/>It is the researcher's intent that the project will demonstrate the utility of biochronology as a tool for exploring the potential impacts of climate change on organisms over time and that halibut biochronology will provide key technical information to fishing communities and to fisheries biologists about the biological history of halibut populations in the region. In addition, the oral history component can provide important information about the community relationship with and experience of the halibut fishery which should be considered policy makers as they develop new fishery policies in the future, particularly in the face of large scale climatic changes. <br/><br/>This research will explore ways in which the community discourse about and relationship with the fishery compares to that of the scientific narratives and will seek ways to bring these perspectives together. It is firmly grounded in a developing body of knowledge where scientists have begun to focus on 'local' or 'traditional' knowledge categories for local ecological systems. In addition, they have begun to develop theoretical frameworks for bringing together scientific and local knowledge about the environment together. The potential findings from this research will not only provide local resource managers and communities with new insights into their resources, it will provide insights into current theoretical understandings of the environment, science, and the construction of local knowledge.

The first part of the project is to study the global existence and structure of multi-dimensional shock fronts solutions for the hyperbolic conservation laws with lower order dissipations, such as relaxation. The second part is to study the nonlinear stability of planar transonic shocks for the Euler-Poisson equations of semiconductors, both in one-dimensional and multi-dimensional cases. This research aims at understanding the global structure and behavior of solutions with shock waves for the nonlinear systems of conservation laws with some additional physical effects, both in one space dimension and several space dimensions, elucidating the influence of the additional physical effects such as relaxations and electric fields on the structure and behavior of shock waves, developing new ideas and techniques for the study of nonlinear partial differential equations, and providing new insight to the numerical computation of shock waves for the nonlinear systems of conservation laws with additional physical effects.<br/><br/>The systems of nonlinear partial differential equations to be studied in this project arise in many branches of applied sciences and engineering, such as gas dynamics, shallow water waves, semiconductor devices and biophysics. These equations provide basic models of importance in a wide range of applications. For those equations, shock waves are very important wave patterns. The study of shock waves is very challenging because they are highly nonlinear. This is particular so in several space dimensions and when the additional important physical effects are taken into account. This research will deepen the understanding of nonlinear waves, particularly for shock waves. Also, new theories and techniques will be developed for applications. Moreover, the theories and methods to be developed in this research will enhance basic understanding of many important nonlinear wave phenomena and their applications to applied sciences and engineering.

While the causes of the extinction event are debated and of intense interest, the effect of the ensuing community changes on species that survived the extinction has not been well investigated. Yet knowledge about effects on survivors will be immensely valuable to predictions of future biodiversity. Thus, instead of studying the Pleistocene extinction solely from the perspective of why species went extinct, PIs are keen to investigate how, or in fact, whether, surviving species were affected by the extinction event. PIs therefore propose to use the rich but untapped Quaternary fossil resources of Shasta County, California, to investigate the response of the mammal species that survived the Pleistocene-Holocene transition event. Their primary goal is to determine community, species, and population response of survivors to the Pleistocene-Holocene transition and to sort out whether the response was due to megafaunal extinction, climatic change or both. To document the nature of late Quaternary disturbance events and impacts on the biota, they will use an interdisciplinary approach, based on tracing changes in morphometrics, isotopes, genetics, and community composition of fossil mammals. This will be facilitated by (i) excavations and analyses of newly discovered and known fossil sites; (ii) obtaining secure stratigraphic control with multiple radiocarbon dates and other geochronologic and stratigraphic techniques; (iii) conducting genetic analyses aimed at detecting signs of population subdivision, density changes and local extirpation; (iv) comparison of pre- and post-extinction communities in terms of taxonomic composition, total species richness, species richness within various size and trophic categories, abundance and evenness of species; (v) tracing phenotypic changes in populations; and (vi) using ancient DNA with phylochronologic techniques to directly recognize genetic structuring of fossil populations. All of the biotic changes will be interpreted within the framework of the extensive extinction and climatic changes that are documented in their study area and globally.

This dramatic restructuring of embryo morphology involves epiboly, a process by which the embryonic cell mass spreads over the surface of the yolk. Epiboly is followed by gastrulation, a large-scale rearrangement of tissues leading to formation of germ layers that ultimately give rise to all the organs and tissues of the body.  An important focus of developmental biology research is to understand the molecular mechanisms controlling epiboly and gastrulation. Using molecular genetic approaches, Dr Garrity's and Dr Horne's laboratories recently identified the calcium channel beta subunit as essential for normal epiboly in zebrafish. Classically, the beta subunit is thought to function as a critical auxiliary subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs), multi-protein complexes that mediate calcium entry into the cell. The auxiliary beta subunits (beta1- beta4) help transport the pore-forming alpha1 subunit to the cell membrane and modulate the electrophysiological properties of the calcium channel. However, recent research suggests that beta subunits may have additional functions in the cell independent of their roles in VGCCs. Mutations in the beta subunit lead to uncoordinated, lethargic behavior and seizures in mice, and have been associated with epilepsy in humans. Ongoing research in Dr Garrity's and Dr Horne's laboratories will use a combination of molecular genetic and biochemical approaches to test potential roles for the beta subunit in interacting with cytoskeletal components or in cell division or differentiation. The proposed research in zebrafish is expected to define new cellular roles for the beta subunit family, which could extend to other cell types in different physiological contexts, and may lead to a better understanding of disease phenotypes in mice and humans. The research will also contribute to our basic understanding of the molecular mechanisms driving epiboly. This collaboration will provide training and research opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students on two campuses, utilizing video conferencing. It will also provide summer internship opportunities for minority undergraduate students enrolled at Colorado State University-Pueblo, an affiliated Hispanic Serving Institution.

The approach is to develop both microfluidic operations for sample collection and preparation and quantum dots-based nanosensors for identification of pathogens according to their ribosomal RNA sequences. The microfluidic unit and the nanosensor unit will be integrated into a system whose performance will be exemplified through analysis of Bacillus spores.<br/> The use of the droplet-based microfluidic operations will minimize the requirement of liquid volume and avoid the need for building moving components on the chip for sample processing that both reduces the consumption of biochemical reagents and the complexity in constructing an integrated microfluidic processing system. The highly sensitive rRNA nanosensors will eliminate the need for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification, thereby simplifying assay protocols and system integration. <br/>This sensing system will have broader impacts with the societal benefits including (i) immediate detection of bio-warfare pathogens such as anthrax to prevent their possible catastrophe and (ii) surveillance of environments in, for example, transportation infrastructures, healthcare buildings, and workplaces. Besides, this research will also have significant impacts on education by (i) establishing micro/nano scientific visual library on web based on the research outcome; (ii) developing micro/nano science coursework with a lab session; and (iii) having undergraduates especially from the underrepresented groups to participate in the research activities.

Standard theories of the monetary transmission mechanism assume that the prices of many goods and services are fixed for extended periods of time. Models incorporating this assumption are widely used by central banks to inform monetary policy decisions. Over the past decade, economists have gained access to detailed data on prices of individual goods and services. They have used these data to measure the importance of price rigidity. An important series of studies uses the data that is collected to construct the Consumer Price Index to measure the frequency with which prices change. These studies conclude that there is substantial heterogeneity across different goods but that, on average, prices change roughly once a quarter. This finding poses a stark challenge to models which emphasize the importance of sticky prices. <br/><br/>Our project will use detailed microeconomic data to assess the empirical importance of a type of nominal rigidity that has heretofore not received much attention in the macroeconomics literature. We refer to this rigidity as the reference price phenomenon. By this we mean the tendency of goods prices to oscillate between two or three values over extended periods of time. It is difficult to reconcile the importance of reference prices with either existing sticky-price models or flexible-price models. We document the extent to which the reference price phenomenon is pervasive. Second, we examine whether the extent and timing of switches between reference prices is correlated with macroeconomic variables, including those characterizing monetary policy. Third, we assess whether our data is consistent with the idea that prices change according to a schedule that is set in advance, i.e., whether pricing plans are sticky. Fourth, we document how often sets of reference points change. This information sheds light on how often firms change plans rather than prices. We use our empirical results to formulate and assess alternative monetary models.<br/><br/>Our research is based on two detailed micro data sets. We obtained the first data set from one of the largest food and drug retailers in North America. We have access to weekly prices, quantities sold, and cost of goods sold for roughly 60,000 products. Products are defined at the unit product code and store level. Our sample period covers 2003 to 2006 and includes roughly four billion data entries. The second data set is from a chain of grocery stores in the Midwest with one hundred outlets. The data set consists of weekly observations on price and sales revenue for 3,500 items. The sample period covers 9 years, beginning in 1989, so that it encompasses one recession and one recovery. With these data, pricing plans can be studied by product characteristics in great detail and with regard to their degree of persistence over up to nine years in less detail.

In some materials, there is a coupling between magnetization and electrical polarization (magnets produce magnetic field, while electrically-polarized materials, or ferroelectrics, produce an electric field). These materials are called multiferroics. Multiferroics hold potential for various applications, such as electronics and information storage technologies. <br/>Recently, two new classes of multiferroics were discovered. In one class, ferroelectricity results directly from magnetism, and in the other the electrical properties are coupled to magnetism due to strong quantum effects. In the both cases, the magneto-electric coupling is unusually strong (a useful property), but the physics of the coupling is unknown. <br/>This project is devoted to investigation of the microscopic origins of the magneto-electric coupling in these materials using x-rays and neutrons. <br/>The results will shed light on the new multiferroics, and will help search for new materials with technologically useful properties. In addition, highly-needed specialists for new National research facilities at Oak Ridge, Brookhaven, and other National Laboratories will be trained.<br/><br/><br/>Technical:<br/>Magnetoelectric (ME) multiferroics are materials in which magnetic and electrical polarizations are coupled to each other. Multiferroics are of scientific interest, and they also hold potential for applications, such as information storage and spintronics. Materials with large ME coupling are rare. Recently, two new classes of multiferroics with unusually large ME coupling were discovered: magnetically-driven multiferroics, and ferroelectrics in which polarization is due to strong electronic correlations (e.g. charge order). The physics of the ME properties in these materials is understood poorly. This project is devoted to investigation of the lattice and magnetic structures of several prominent compound series of new multiferroics: the REMn2O5 system, perovskite manganites with charge order, and ReM2O4 layered magnets. Ferroelectric distortions, magnetic structures, excitations, and effects of magnetic and electric fields on these properties will be investigated using x-ray and neutron scattering. These studies will shed light on the mechanism of the ME effect, and will aid in design of new magnetoelectrics with enhanced properties. Students and postdocs trained under this Project will become specialists in scattering techniques, fulfilling an urgent current need for personnel at newly constructed National facilities at Oak Ridge, Brookhaven, and other National Laboratories. This project will also foster collaboration between regional Universities under the auspices of the recently established Rutgers Center for Emergent Materials.

Users have very diverse computer equipment ranging from handheld devices to desktops, and downloaded items range from simple stock quotes to news stories to full movies. Such highly heterogeneous circumstances will be predominant in the networks of the near future. Current schemes for content download are inefficient at addressing the mentioned heterogeneity. The goal of this project is to obtain new and improved schemes that would result in better access to content for the users while improving the network utilization.<br/><br/>The research will focus on three coding techniques to attack the problem: rateless coding at the application layer, network coding at the network layer, and collaborative coding at the physical layer. Quantitative and qualitative limitations of network and rateless coding in heterogeneous environments will be studied to develop new practical coding schemes appropriate in such circumstances. Another research direction is to investigate and analyze mechanism to make networks more uniform using physical layer collaborative transmission schemes. An assessment will be made on how this process affects the performance of the higher layer coding schemes. <br/><br/>Broader Impact: The research, if successful, will improve the efficiency and availability of data in networks. This has the potential to benefit directly and indirectly the population at large. In addition, this collaborative research has the potential to obtain fundamental new insights at the interface of coding and information theory and combinatorial optimization. Several PhD students will be supported and trained in interdisciplinary areas and they would also obtain valuable industrial experience.

Using the immersed boundary approach, mathematical models will be built to represent the fluid dynamics around the proximal tubule brush border microvilli, and to represent the tubular flow in a papillary collecting duct undergoing peristaltic contractions. The resulting models will be used to study the effects of the two-way fluid-structure interactions on solute and water transport along the proximal tubule and along the collecting duct. Additionally, nonlinear optimization techniques will be used to further the physiological investigation of cellular homeostasis, by assessing the effectiveness of various regulatory mechanisms in homeostatic recovery.<br/><br/>If one is stranded in the ocean for days, should one drink the sea water to quench one's thirst? The answer depends on whether the subject is a person (don't!) or a rat (no problem, drink away!). The reason is that the osmolality (i.e., total solute concentration) of sea water is higher than the maximum urine osmolality that can be produced by a human. In contrast, a little rat can produce a urine twice as concentrated as sea water. It may be hard to believe, but the mechanism by which some mammals produce highly concentrated urine is not well understood. This project will use mathematical analysis and computational techniques to answer a number of basic and important questions in renal physiology: How do the peristaltic contractions of the renal papilla impact the concentrating mechanism of the kidney? How do the brush border microvilli, which are found along portions of the nephrons (little tubules in the kidney), affect solute transport in the kidney? What are the most effective ways for kidney cells to change aspects of its transport properties in order to survive in its ever-changing surroundings? The answers to those questions are crucial in an overall understanding of renal physiology, renal pathophysiology, and other autoregulatory mechanisms.

A review of the GSE funded studies and products will be conducted to identify metrics and measures that are used in research on gender and as indicators of change. A well articulated logic model for evaluation and a set of benchmarks will result from interviews with principal investigators and the GSE program officer. Recommendations for measures of broader impact that may capture the intended interactions between research, dissemination, and extension service projects will be derived from the emergent program logic. Finally, a report of the broader impact measures and metrics identified for each of the three GSE Program components will be prepared, linking the evaluation logic model components to the strategic goals of NSF and to existing national data that frame the context for research on gender in science and engineering. <br/><br/>The intellectual merits of this proposal include the emphasis on metrics and measures that may be used to capture the dynamic interactions among contributors to the GSE learning community. Exploring various indicators and asking how to capture the nature of links between logic model components as well as the short and long term broader impacts of the GSE Program are also novel and on the cutting edge of measurement research. Through this study, implicit theories of action, underlying evaluation logic, and relevant metrics and measures will be identified. The proposed principal investigator (PI) and grantee organization bring strengths in drawing together knowledge of large scale data resources to triangulating quantitative and qualitative insights necessary for exploratory research. Some of this experience in measurement and evaluation has come from previous and successfully completed evaluations of NSF-EHR programs. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of this study will inform principal investigators by providing a focused review and annotated inventory of measures, protocols, and instruments that may be appropriate for their work. GSE researchers will benefit from the identification of knowledge gaps and testable assumptions that result from articulating the evaluation logic model and corresponding implicit theories of action. Finally, program officers, policy-makers, and the public will benefit by having an array of possible measures to use in evaluating the broader impacts of federally funded programs.

Temporal and spatial monitoring of the plume concentrations are needed to assess risk, make decisions and take remedial action. Current underground contaminant plume monitoring technologies are inefficient, expensive and ineffective. Wireless sensor technologies have the potential to dramatically improve this process. <br/>A closed-loop system integrating wireless sensor network based monitoring with numerical models for plume tracking is being developed, in which sensor data continuously calibrates and validates the system identification and prediction models, while the output from these models direct the sensor network operation to optimize constraints such as accuracy and power consumption.  The system is based on a novel virtual sensor network architecture with broader applicability beyond plume tracking. Algorithms and protocols being developed support the formation, usage, adaptation and maintenance of dynamic subsets of collaborating sensors, named Virtual Sensor Networks (VSNs).   VSN protocols for collaboration among groups of sensors will greatly ease the task of deploying sensor networks, especially in environments where multiple geographically overlapping applications are deployed.  A proof-of-concept laboratory test bed that captures the complex subsurface processes is used for integration and evaluation of VSN protocols.  This interdisciplinary project  will significantly advance the state-of-the art in subsurface plume tracking and sensor networking technologies. It will stimulate a unique partnership of electrical engineers,  computer scientists and environmental researchers, and demonstrate closed-loop operation of computer models and sensor networks  to solve complex environmental problems.

Recent observations have revealed a number of puzzles and raised important questions that require theoretical understanding and modeling. <br/><br/>In this project, the physics and astrophysics related to the surfaces, atmospheres, and magnetospheres of highly magnetized neutron stars will be studied.  The work is essentially organized into two parts. First, quantitative calculations of the cohesive properties of condensed matter in strong magnetic fields will be performed.  These are fundamental quantities characterizing magnetized neutron star surfaces.  The possible observational consequences of strong surface cohesion of neutron stars with strong magnetic fields will also be explored, including surface condensation and the development of polar gap accelerators (relevant to radio emission) in the magnetospheres of pulsars and magnetars.  Second, the basic physics of proton/ion cyclotron line transfer in a variety of environments will be studied, and applied the physics to neutron star atmospheres and radiation bubbles in magnetar outbursts.  Dr. Lai's ongoing program of numerical modeling of partially ionized neutron star atmospheres of heavy elements will also be continued.<br/><br/>Some of the research results (e.g. the cohesive property of condensed matter at different field strengths) will have lasting value to the astrophysics/physics community, going beyond explaining particular observations.  A graduate student will be supported here and trained in scientific computing and multidisciplinary subjects required for this work, and an international collaboration will also be fostered.  The results will be published in refereed journals and presented in appropriate scientific meetings.  A web interface where researchers can easily access these results will be created.  In addition, Dr. Lai will integrate the results of this research into his general education lectures at Cornell.

Indeed, individual recognition is the primary means of assessment for most primate species. However, a growing body of evidence indicates that humans also use physical characteristics (?quality signals?) as a way to evaluate others ? particularly in the context of competition and mating. One reason why humans might utilize quality signals is because they live in extremely large social groups where they frequently encounter individuals they do not recognize. However, this hypothesis is difficult to test because quality signals are rare among primates, and little is known about the function and use of signaling in non-human primates. Thus, the main objective of this research is to determine how primates living in large groups ?size up? potential rivals and mates ? a task that involves mapping the boundary of where individual recognition ends and where other short-hand means of assessment begin. The subjects for this research are wild geladas (Theropithecus gelada), a monkey that lives only in the highlands of Ethiopia. Geladas are an ideal species for this research for two reasons. First, while the vast majority of primates live in small groups where individuals recognize every group member, geladas (like humans) live in extremely large groups where individual recognition may not extend beyond a small subgroup. Second, male geladas are unusual among primates in having 2 conspicuous traits that may serve as quality signals, a red patch of skin on the chest and neck, and ritualized display vocalizations. By combining behavioral observations, experimental playbacks, and laboratory analysis of fecal steroid hormones, this research addresses 3 questions: (1) What are the limits of individual recognition in gelada society? (2) For recognized individuals, do they base reproductive decisions on this information? (3) Alternatively (or additionally), do geladas use quality signals, such as chest color or vocal displays, to evaluate potential competitors or mates? <br/><br/>The PI and co-PI of this project are committed to integrating research goals with education and conservation at several levels. First, over the course of this three-year project, a post-doc will receive training in playback experiments and hormone analysis, 4-6 graduate students will gain summer field experience, and 6-8 undergraduates will gain experience analyzing data for senior theses. Second, it is expected that 1-3 Ethiopian graduate students in primate behavior will join the project. Third, an Ethiopian counterpart will be sponsored for graduate training in wildlife management. Finally, this project's research presence in the Simien Mountains National Park (currently on the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger) is assisting conservation efforts. Conservation projects that have been initiated thus far include: a census of geladas living in the area, a survey for tourists on park conservation, and a survey for the local people to gauge the degree of human-wildlife conflict. Both the PI and co-PI will continue to dedicate a fraction of their field time to conservation efforts in the area.

The system will be used to study the frontiers and possible boundaries of quantum mechanics, and will serve a wide range of collaborators (experimental and theoretical), as well as being central to the advanced education of students.  The experiments which this system will enable with microfabricated, nanomechanical structures will help to resolve fundamental questions of modern physics, especially those concerning the boundary between the Classical and Quantum regimes, and questions regarding the validity of quantum mechanics for large objects.  Furthermore, these developments are expected to impact advanced technologies, particularly those requiring ultra-sensitive mechanical detectors and in the realms of quantum information and computation.  To enter and probe this exciting realm of physics, an advanced new system is required which combines a nuclear demagnetization refrigerator accessing 1-10mK temperatures with a heavily engineered electronic environment.  The proposed system and resulting research activity will also provide an excellent education to the students and researchers.

Dixie Highway Suite 650	CORAL GABLES	FL	331462926	3052843924	SBE	1352	0000, 9178, 9251, OTHR, SMET	$0.00	Slums have long been a characteristic part of the landscapes of large cities in the less-developed world, and they have proliferated in recent decades. This research project will examine slums, but instead of placing the usual focus on slums as problematic places to live in, the investigators will concentrate on the role of slums as sites of economic production. The investigators will systematically study the nature of economic activity in slums, how that activity is rooted in the slum, and its connections to the wider urban economy. What kind of economic activity takes place in slums, and how important is it to slum communities? Why does it take place in that particular slum location, and what is the nature and extent of spatial concentration? What are the external linkages, and how is this activity connected to the wider urban economy? The project us expected to breaks new ground in three ways. First, it will combine different geographical and thematic literatures, such as writings on slums that often disregard economic dimensions and writings on the new economic geography that lack attention to slum milieus. Second, the project will develop a theoretical argument as to why slums can be important sites of economic activity. Explanations include the immediate presence of labor, the absence of zoning policies, and strong social networks. Finally, the project will place major emphasis on primary data collection on labor and firms in two large and well-known slums, Dharavi in Mumbai (India) and Klipspruit Valley in Johannesburg (South Africa). The investigators will combine large scale surveying of slum households and slum firms, statistical analysis, interviews, and mapping. The project will reveal the nature and significance of economic production in the two study areas and will contribute to general theory development on the spatial organization of urban economies and on the nature of slums.<br/><br/>About one billion people currently live in slums world-wide, and if current trends continue, the number will double by 2030. It is critical to better understand the economic logic of slums not just as labor reservoirs but also as sites or zones of specialized economic production. Without such understanding, one cannot fully understand the overall urban economy of these cities. Urban economic development strategies must take into account the economic role of slums, particularly in regard to popular efforts to stimulate local enterprise development. Furthermore, policies dealing with slums thus far have systematically ignored their economic functions, but slum eradication, rehabilitation, and relocation may have important economic consequences. The project therefore will be relevant to academic, social, and policy concerns.

The principal means will be through the initiation of a series of conferences devoted explicitly to work that effects this integration. <br/><br/>The intellectual merit of the proposal rests on the attempt to invigorate the existing community in history and philosophy of science, as well as attracting new scholars with an interest in integrated HPS; and to generate new scholarship in integrated history and philosophy of science. This goal will be achieved by the creation of a new forum devoted to integrated HPS that is open to all interested scholars, at which they can meet and present their work. <br/><br/>The broader impact will derive through the long-standing interest of people outside the field in integrated history and philosophy of science. Many of our colleagues in the sciences who seek a broader understanding of their science find work in integrated history and philosophy of science to be especially illuminating, since it can connect the foundational issues in the science with contextual issues. Scholars in the humanities often find these analyses helpful for similar reasons and as one model of a highly successful type of interdisciplinary endeavor. Finally, fundamental research in integrated history and philosophy of science provides primary source material for education. It provides to science education materials that can be used to convey the humanistic context of science to students; as well as the importance of science to humanistic studies. It also offers fundamental source materials for secondary science teachers struggling to convey to their students the nature of science.

This radical high-frequency topology is based on a novel hybrid modulation scheme, next-generation SiC power devices, and nanocrystalline transformer core. The mechanism for validation is twofold: scaled experimental design for concept validation and analytical design using empirically-validated SiC device models for performance and reliability predictions at high power.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit:<br/><br/>Conventional low-frequency high-power inverter needs extremely bulky, expensive, and huge-footprint-space filters and transformer. The proposed polyphase inverter eliminates the need for dc link filters and line-frequency utility transformer. Further, due to i) the unique hybrid modulation (which reduces switching loss), ii) significantly reduced core loss of the nanocrystalline transformer core, and iii) reduced on-state drop (implying lower conduction loss) and reduced device capacitance and reverse recovery (implying reduced switching loss) of SiC high voltage devices, operation of high power inverter is feasible at high efficiency even at high frequency. <br/><br/>Broader Impact:<br/><br/>The proposed inverter has applications ranging from FutureGen, FACTs, solid-state power station, distributed generation, interconnection of two subgrids operating at different frequencies, electric ship, fuel-cell APU for aerospace, to high power UPS. Results of the research will be integrated into two power courses, which are taught by the PI and taken by several students. The project will support 1 Ph.D. student and will incorporate 6 Sr. Design and undergraduate students (with

However, there has not been a<br/>corresponding evolution in the model under which security policy<br/>operates in such environments: policies must still make independent<br/>decisions using only partial information: just what is known by that<br/>component at the time the decision is made. Thus, security policy must<br/>operate under certain assumptions that often cannot be validated. Such<br/>unchecked assumptions offer a way for attackers to bypass security by<br/>exploiting unforeseen loopholes. Consequently, administrators often<br/>use additional security mechanisms, such as intrusion-detection<br/>systems, that are poorly integrated with each other and with the<br/>explicit system access-control policy.<br/><br/>This project is exploring the use of coordinated security policy<br/>mechanisms in heterogeneous, large-scale distributed environments. The<br/>assumptions on which security policy decisions are based are always<br/>checked against current facts. Changes of these facts are signaled by<br/>events propagated to other security-critical elements. Security<br/>mechanisms become dynamic, allowing for coordinated and continuous<br/>policy re-evaluation throughout the duration of an entity's<br/>interactions with the various components of the system. This model<br/>naturally integrates access control, intrusion detection and other<br/>defensive mechanisms, allowing for the unification of protection and<br/>reaction under the auspices of a common security policy. The result is<br/>a more reliable and robust computing infrastructure that is resilient<br/>to new threats and attacks, and bridge the gap between the<br/>capabilities offered by advanced defense mechanisms and the inability<br/>of security policy to take advantage of them in a coherent,<br/>coordinated manner.

Duckles<br/>University of Arizona<br/><br/>The rapidly growing green building market is changing the types of buildings organizational consumers want, the materials that builders use and the way in which architects design and think about buildings. This dissertation will examine the way in which the actors within a quickly shifting market promote, attack, implement or alter the ideals of sustainability and environmentalism in the face of established rules, norms, and traditions, i.e., institutions. We will examine the mechanisms by which the ideology of a movement becomes integrated into the marketplace. This work will meet at the intersection of three literatures: social movements, organizational change and economic sociology to address the emergence of an embedded market, gain an understanding of the institutional shifts as a social movement outcome and discuss the relationship between the profit motive and the motive for organizations to be socially and environmentally responsible. To accomplish this, we propose to study how the environmental ideals are commensurated as new institutional standards emerge through the creation of the LEED building certification system, created by the US Green Building Council. The study will focus on LEED certified buildings in the state of California and in three phases gather data on builders and architects, organizational consumers and suppliers. Methods include participant observation, targeted interviews, and the gathering of document data on green buildings. Analysis will be conducted using a unique blend of narrative and process analysis. <br/><br/>The broader impact of this study will address the growth and creation of markets, particularly in response to ideological origins and will have implications for the way in which social movement ideology becomes institutionalized. Green building is also a case that addresses the emergence of socially responsible and ecologically responsive organizations.

Hope Ave.	Providence	RI	029061648	4012746310	CSE	7367	7367, 9150, 9215, HPCC	$0.00	This project is a collaborative effort between the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Media Laboratory and the Groden Center to develop and evaluate wearable social-emotional technology that helps individuals with high-functioning autism or Asperger syndrome acquire an affinity for the social domain and improve their overall social abilities. The project will develop the first wearable camera system capable of perceiving and visualizing social-emotional information in real-time human interaction. Using a small wearable camera and video-pattern analysis algorithms, the system analyzes video of the wearer or interaction partner and tags it at multiple granularities (facial actions, communicative facial or head gestures, and emotions). <br/><br/>The wearable system aims to: (1) facilitate learning and systemizing of social-emotional cues; (2) promote self-reflection and perspective-taking; (3) allow wearers to study subtle nonverbal cues and share experiences with peers, family members, and caregivers; and (4) contribute new computational models and theories of social-emotional intelligence in machines. A clinical study will compare the efficacy of the wearable system to current gold standard interventions for autism spectrum disorders (ASD). A participatory approach to the co-design and use of technology draws on the experiences of individuals with ASD and their solutions to systematizing social interactions, thereby empowering them to enhance their relationships, while participating in the development of next-generation social-emotional intelligent technologies.<br/><br/>The project will make significant contributions to the difficult challenge of developing machine intelligence that is robust at handling human social interaction. When people or machines fail to perceive, understand, and act on social-emotional cues they are hindered in their ability to interact with and learn from others. The results of this interdisciplinary work can be leveraged in human-computer interaction, robotics, and technologies with social-emotional intelligence. The research will also provide investigators with a new tool to study nonverbal communication outside of laboratory settings. <br/><br/>This project brings together the overlapping and converging goals and challenges of autism research and affective computing, both already interdisciplinary in nature, and demonstrates how a collaboration could lead to several mutually beneficial outcomes ? from developing new tools to assist people with ASD in understanding and functioning in the social-emotional world, to developing new computational models and theories that enable technology to provide an overall better experience to those who use it. This work also promotes the training and education of students and people with ASD by involving them in cutting-edge scientific research.<br/>

The semantic information includes frame information based on FrameNet together with sense information based on WordNet. <br/>The annotations in the corpus are manually assigned by human annotators to ensure their reliability. Bootstrapping methods, using portions of the hand validated annotations, are being used to improve the performance of automatic annotation tools. The corpus is drawn from the materials in the American National Corpus, which consists of written data and speech transcriptions generated y native speakers of American English and representing a broad range of genres. All of the annotations are represented in a common format to enable merging different annotation layers, so that interactions among different linguistic phenomena can be studied.<br/><br/>The manually annotated corpus will provide an unparalleled resource for computational linguists and linguists who seek to identify patterns of syntactic and semantic usage that can feed the development of language models. This information can be used to train software to automatically annotate unseen data, which in turn enhances applications such as information retrieval and extraction and machine translation. Usage patterns for American English are also invaluable for the development of materials and tools to support English language learning. The resulting corpus and its annotations, together with tools for manipulating the data, will be made freely available for research purposes through the Linguistic Data Consortium.

Proton transfer is a key aspect of a broad array of chemical problems, including acid-base reactions, energy storage and utilization, and catalysis. The center is focusing its investigation of the chemistry of proton conduction via site-to-site jumps and well-defined scaffolds. The main objectives are to (i) identify optimal functional groups and the underlying dynamics of facile proton transfer; and (ii) fabricate ideal scaffolds that produce stable and rapid proton conduction. <br/><br/>An important application area of this research is the design of better membranes for fuel cells. In keeping with this goal, the CBC will create a web-based entity, the National Chemical Energy Research Network, NCERN, that will (i) act as a dynamic interface among energy researchers and research centers; and (ii) foster better communication between chemists working on energy-related research and the general public.

0742406	Asymptotic Problems in Parabolic Equations and in Random Transport	DMS	PROBABILITY	07/01/2007	08/08/2007	Leonid Koralov	MD	University of Maryland College Park	Standard Grant	Tomek Bartoszynski	08/31/2008	$36,065.00		koralov@math.umd.edu	3112 LEE BLDG 7809 Regents Drive	COLLEGE PARK	MD	207425141	3014056269	MPS	1263	0000, OTHR	$0.00	0405152<br/>Koralov<br/> The project concerns several closely related problems in the theory of parabolic partial differential equations and in random transport. The goal of the project is to investigate the behavior of solutions to the parabolic Anderson problem, the solutions to the equation of the evolution of a magnetic field in a random flow, and a variety of probabilistic aspects of transport phenomena. For the Anderson problem the study focuses on the equations with random time-dependent potential. In the scalar case this problem can be looked upon as a scalar model for the equation of the evolution of the magnetic field in a random flow. In the vector case the Anderson model is related to passive transport by random flows, which is also a subject of the current project. The study of transport phenomena is concerned with the long-time behavior of ensembles of points as well as connected sets under the action of a large class of physically relevant flows. <br/> Most of the proposed problems arise naturally in the study of various physical phenomena in meteorology, oceanography, and the theory of turbulence. In particular, when studying passive transport, one assumes that certain properties of the media are known (for example, while the temperatures or velocities on the surface of the ocean can not be measured in every single point exactly, certain statistical information is assumed to be available). The problem then consists of trying to predict the long-time behavior of a passive scalar (such as an oil spill carried by the currents on the surface of the ocean) based on the statistical properties of the underlying media. Several such problems can be formulated in relatively simple terms, yet the solutions are very non-trivial, and at times surprising.

Mbaaiwa, Fernanda de Vasconcellos Pegas, and Carter A. Hunt, will undertake comparative research on the local effects of ecotourism in four rural communities in Peru, Botswana, Brazil, and Nicaragua. The researchers will address social science debates about the influence of local and international markets on human-environment interactions. They also will produce empirically grounded analyses that use the findings of descriptive case studies to build generalizing theory and evaluate the utility of ecotourism as a market-based tool for conservation and development. <br/><br/>The research builds on a ten-year study of an indigenous-owned ecotourism lodge in the Peruvian Amazon. In that case, ecotourism has had contradictory effects. It has fortified local institutions for managing common pool resources, but it has also led to expanded exploitation of natural resources and new conflicts over profits. The researchers hypothesize that community management of ecotourism is especially important for building local institutions for conservation and development. The four focal communities in this study were chosen because they all experience direct costs and benefits from ecotourism, but differ in their levels of control over decision-making and ownership of ecotourism operations. <br/><br/>The team will conduct six months of ethnographic field research in each site. They will carry out interviews, focus group discussions, and participant observation to assess community participation in ecotourism and its effects the economy, resource use and conservation, and overall perceptions of well being. They also will conduct surveys of stratified samples of community residents. The data from all four cases will be combined to conduct systematic comparisons. Causal conditions for predicting conservation outcomes from ecotourism will be assessed using Qualitative Comparative Analysis. Comparisons will also be made within and across communities at the level of households and individuals.<br/><br/>The study is important because it will contribute to anthropological theory about the influence of the market on human-environment interactions. Specifically, it will generate better understanding of conditions under which market incentives interact with local institutions to enable collective action for conservation. From a practical perspective, the research will lead to better policy for ensuring that communities benefit socially, economically, and environmentally from ecotourism. The study is innovative because it will use ethnographic approaches to evaluate social and cultural changes associated with ecotourism (not just economic ones), especially as they relate to conservation ethics and institutions for resource management. The results of the research will allow conservationists, development practitioners, tour operators, and local community leaders to understand more clearly the mechanisms by which ecotourism meets development goals while also protecting the environment. Finally, the research will foster international research collaboration and will contribute to the doctoral training of three graduate students.

The purpose of this project is to investigate two very important but mostly untouched MANET security issues: user unlocatability and communication anonymity. Without solving them, mobile users can be easily tracked or their communication patterns can be easily gathered for user profiling, which would jeopardize the user privacy and make them vulnerable to pinpoint attacks. In this project, a novel overlay-based approach OverUCA, an anonymous network overlay composed of nodes that anonymously communicate with one another atop the underlying MANET substrate, will be investigated to achieve user unlocatability, source anonymity, destination anonymity, source-destination unlinkability, and full compatibility with existing routing and MAC protocols. The success of this research will have a tremendous impact on advancing the deployments of MANETs in security-critical commercial, civilian, and military applications. This research will provide a viable way to fight against pinpoint attacks, advance the state-of-the-art in the wireless security research, and spark new research activities in securing MANETs. Moreover, the results from this research will be disseminated widely through high-quality conference and journal publications and public talks. Furthermore, the research outcome will be integrated into the educational curricula across two institutions. Finally, a couple of minority (female) students will work for their Ph.D. degrees, and hence this project will train the minority professionals for the national work force.

The program offers research/internship opportunities to students and provides support to recipients through personal and internet communication with other scholars, career planning assistance, and mentoring. Most of the ACA students are from Appalachia where the per capita income is 34.2% below the national average and the unemployment rate is 123.8% of the national average. The ACA is using this project to provide students with faculty support at a level and magnitude that is far greater than would happen if the individual institutions were not collaborating. This project is having a positive effect on the students, the schools they attend, and central Appalachia, with four expected outcomes: more students are majoring in STEM areas; scholarship recipients are learning about potential careers in Appalachia; research institutions are broadening recruitment efforts at ACA schools and more ACA students are pursuing post-baccalaureate studies; and the work force qualifications of recent college graduates in the Appalachian states are improving with the addition of more students who have skills crucial to attracting industry.

The data samples collected with massive particle detectors of experimental HEP require significant data handling and processing loads. The push for grid-based computing was significantly driven by the phenomenal computing needs expected for the LHC experiments that will soon be coming online at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland. Even categories of experiments that traditionally do not demand large computation resources, such as neutrino experiments, are now producing high statistics datasets that are requiring significant computational resources for analysis and interpretation of the results of recent experiments.<br/><br/>On the theoretical side, the physics of the strong interaction (QCD) had been analytically intractable for a wide range of problems of current interest. Lattice QCD is a tool that allows us to investigate the dynamics of QCD, understand how certain low energy phenomena arise, and compute the consequences of the Standard Model. It is expected to play an important role in supporting the experimental effort and in discovering new physics. The computational demands for the high precision, phenomenologically interesting lattice QCD calculations are such that high performance massively parallel supercomputers are required. However, small scale resources are also critical for developing new ideas and training graduate and undergraduate students. In addition, small scale resources with enough local storage can play an important role in the analysis of the gauge field configurations and quark propagators generated on the big machines. This part of the analysis is usually done by small groups located at universities.<br/><br/>This proposal addresses the computational needs of the W&M neutrino group and the larger neutrino community for simulations of neutrino interactions in the MINOS neutrino detectors currently operation at Fermilab in Batavia, Illinois and the Soudan Underground Lab in northern Minnesota. Concurrently, this proposal will provide a facility for performing small pilot projects in lattice QCD and for supporting the data analysis requirements of the large computations performed on the major Lattice QCD machines. In effect, this proposal enables the PIs and W&M students to play a significant role in the larger Lattice QCD community and allow them access to the results of the major computations in this area.

As the number of online databases grows, there has been an increased need for techniques and tools that allow users and applications to leverage the high-quality information that is hidden behind their Web form interfaces. This project will address the problem of discovering and organizing hidden-Web data sources, a necessary step to large-scale retrieval and integration of Web information. Scalability of novel techniques over very large volumes of data will be explored. New machine learning techniques will be applied to the problem of locating and organizing Web site fronts to databases and the overall strategy of locating and organizing web forms that serve as user interfaces to databases. These would then be clustered to discover domains<br/>(categories) of databases the domains would be used to organize the collected forms into a searchable collection. That collection will allow users with particular interests to located databases that serve their needs.

The project's goal is to delineate how the position of fugitives as refugees from enslavement shaped the economic, social, and cultural organization of their villages. Literate outsiders interacted little with runaway slaves, and, consequently, the written record offers limited insight into their communities. Archaeology provides a valuable window onto these refugees' lives through analysis of the material record they left behind. The project will specifically compare the cultural cohesion and economic organization of fugitive slave groups and the coastal hinterland communities that neighbored them. <br/><br/>As the first archaeological study of fugitive slave settlements in Eastern Africa, this project will illuminate the lives of people little understood by scholars in any field. The study will also promote interregional analysis of slavery and slave resistance by expanding the comparative perspective already fostered by similar research in Mauritius, Brazil, the Caribbean, and the mainland U.S. Finally and most broadly, this project will contribute to cross-disciplinary understandings of community creation. Fugitive slave communities typically formed more rapidly than communities forged under less perilous circumstances. This accelerated rate of development allows scientists to use fugitive slave groups to better understand group formation: in the absence of shared traditions and practices, what holds newly formed communities together? This project's Eastern Africa focus offers a distinct cultural context and power dynamic in which to consider community formation. Runaways in Eastern Africa typically negotiated a much more fluid social environment than did their counterparts in the New World. This project's analysis of fugitive slave community creation in a very different power dynamic than those previously studied in the Americas will help to clarify how power dynamics affect and/or disrupt group formation. <br/><br/>Beyond its academic importance, the proposed project offers several broader impacts. The National Museums of Kenya (NMK) is a participant in the UNESCO Slave Routes Program, and one of its aims is the development of a museum on slavery. The proposed project, which will be affiliated with the NMK, promises to advance such goals. By incorporating NMK archaeologists, the project will also promote local participation in Kenyan archaeology. The project is equally committed to disseminating its research results to public audiences. Planned outreach strategies include on-site school tours during excavation and the creation of curricular materials. The development of on-site educational tourism may further integrate local communities into the research process. A longer-term goal is the creation of a website explicating the project for both professional and public audiences. Project results will also be shared at academic conferences and in publication in professional journals. Through participation in these broader scientific discourses, the author will strive to promote an awareness of her work among researchers with related interests. Finally, the project will support the graduate education and professional development of the author.

The first part explores the factorization phenomenon, a<br/>direct and unexpected link between the representations of<br/>finite-dimensional Lie groups and infinite-dimensional loop groups. The<br/>second part seeks to relate two important combinatorial tools, the<br/>Littelmann and Kyoto path models, to the geometric topology of loop groups<br/>as studied by Bott and Mirkovic-Vilonen. The aim is to give a natural<br/>geometric framework for these tools, which are originally defined in purely<br/>combinatorial terms, in order to better understand their combinatorial<br/>structure. The third part seeks to compute explicit bases for the<br/>(co)homology and K-theory of loop groups, so-called affine Schubert and<br/>Grothendieck polynomials, applying the geometric approach of Bott-Samelson<br/>to extend and simplify the recent work of combinatorists.<br/><br/>Loop groups are symmetry groups of infinite-dimensional objects, but are<br/>closely analogous to symmetries of finite-dimensional objects such as<br/>spheres. Loop group symmetry, at the boundary between tame (finite) and<br/>wild (intractable) problems, is crucial in many areas, such as the<br/>Langlands program in number theory, conformal field theory in particle<br/>physics, soliton theory in integrable systems, and solvable lattice models<br/>in statistical physics. Precise combinatorial analysis of loop-group<br/>representations makes possible explicit formulas and solutions in all these<br/>areas. Furthermore, the resulting combinatorics of periodic permutations<br/>and Young tableaux has applications to problems of computer science such as<br/>sorting algorithms and network design in cases which are infinite, but<br/>periodic.

This presents a maintenance and evolution challenge when a code clone is changed because it is likely that the other corresponding clones require similar adaptation. This research project will investigate program analysis and transformation techniques to support the categorization, selection, and refactoring of code clones. The topic of clone detection has been investigated in the past by many researchers. However, scientific foundations to support analysis and automated transformation of the results reported from a clone detection tool are still lacking and often require a manual approach to clone refactoring. The key focus of this research is an investigation into the foundational analysis and transformation techniques that will provide a software engineer with the proper tool support to increase their productivity while improving the correctness of adaptive changes in the presence of clones. This project has potential for broad impact across many domains in critical application areas (e.g., scientific and ?e-science,? as well as middleware for enterprise software). In addition, contributions toward educational objectives are core to the proposed research plan.

Causal discovery is essential to scientific discovery and decision making in domains as diverse as medicine, epidemiology, ecology, and economy. The need for assisting policy making and the availability of massive amounts of data puts new requirements on the design of effective methods to automate causal discovery. The approach is to first organize a challenge around a number or real and semi-artificial tasks to refine evaluation metrics, then design and implement an interactive web-based environment facilitating virtual experiments on artificial systems.<br/><br/>Intellectual merit: Standard benchmarks are needed to foster scientific progress, but the design of a good causal discovery benchmark platform, not biased in favor a particular model or approach, is not trivial. Two key elements distinguish this proposal: (1) the interactive aspect of the platform allowing researchers to emulate experimentation by placing queries on the systems; (2) the dynamic aspect of the platform acting as a repository of new problems and proposed solutions.<br/><br/>Broader impact: Challenges with open participation over the Internet, provide a good opportunity for researchers of any origin to demonstrate excellence and quickly make themselves known. Advancing the methodology for reliably determining causal relationships would have a great socio-economical impact, e.g. by improving policy making. The subject of causal discovery is particularly pedagogical to develop the logic of scientific discovery in students.<br/>

For example, a stoplight turning green might automatically elicit the response of stepping on the gas pedal to move forward. However, you must change that response if we see a child entering the intersection, or if your goal is to make a left turn. Failures to control behavior in these ways can have important consequences. Research with humans and other primates shows that a network of brain regions including frontal and parietal cortex is important for the cognitive control of behavior. Research with rodents shows that the neurotransmitter acetylcholine is an important chemical messenger used by the brain in situations that require control. With support from the National Science Foundation, Dr. Lustig will use pharmacological fMRI to integrate these two lines of research and establish how acetylcholine influences cognitive control functions in the human brain. Participants will take one of three doses (placebo, low dose, high dose) of a drug that increases acetylcholine's action in the brain by slowing the rate at which it is broken down. They will then undergo functional brain imaging while performing tasks that make low or high demands for the cognitive control of behavior in response to changing environmental cues. The results will answer several important questions about how acetylcholine acts in the human brain to influence the control of behavior. First, they will show which parts of the human frontal-parietal control network are specifically influenced by acetylcholine. Second, they will show whether all aspects of performance are influenced by increased cholinergic function, or only those that make high demands for cognitive control. Third, they will clarify whether acetylcholine has its effects by increasing the engagement of control-related brain regions or by helping those brain regions to act more efficiently. The project also compares several different methods of analyzing pharmacological fMRI data to determine which may be best for future studies examining how different drugs influence brain function.<br/><br/>This work will help us better understand how the human brain allows us to control and change our behavior in order to accomplish our goals. This ability improves as children mature into adults, and is disrupted in many clinical disorders or when normal adults are stressed or fatigued. The project will help to integrate human and animal research, and to improve the technology by which scientists study the action of drugs on the brain. Dr. Lustig's research team actively involves both graduate and undergraduate students. The laboratory specifically targets the inclusion of students from under-represented groups, recruiting from synergistic NSF programs such as the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program. As part of their experience in the lab, students receive training in experimental methods, brain anatomy, and the fundamentals of fMRI. Students independently present this work via posters and slide presentations at local or regional meetings, and are involved in presentation at national meetings and journal publication.

This program is designed to provide detailed mechanistic information on elementary chemical reactions. Methodological improvements are underway to extend the algorithm to variable step sizes, to develop methods to treat reactions without barriers, to implement more accurate density functionals, to increase the range of reaction complex properties, and to automate the analysis procedures. Planned applications include rearrangement reactions, substitution reactions, addition/cycloaddition reactions, electrocyclic reactions and chelotropic reactions. This work is having a broad impact through the creation of a publicly accessible atlas of chemical reaction mechanisms, which may open new routes of synthesis and control. The software will be made available to the scientific community, along with training workshops to ensure its proper use. New courses in computational chemistry and reaction dynamics that relate directly to the research are under development at the undergraduate and graduate levels.

The goal of this project is to determine how closely adapted cutthroat trout are to the physical environment of the streams that they inhabit. A laboratory experiment will measure how juvenile westslope cutthroat trout survive in water temperatures that are different from their native temperature. A field experiment will introduce several populations of cutthroat trout into a stream currently having no fish and monitor how fish from each population survive. Both experiments will use fish occupying a wide variety of habitats.<br/><br/> This research will help determine how fine of a geographic scale natural selection operates, and ultimately, how the possible benefits of adaptation to a local environment compare to impacts of inbreeding. This will benefit fisheries management because moving fish from large thriving populations to small struggling populations is one of the most promising methods for preserving cutthroat trout. State agencies are currently reluctant to move fish because they lack knowledge regarding how closely adapted cutthroat trout populations are to their native streams. If cutthroats show strong patterns of local adaptation to their native environment, introducing fish into a population struggling to survive could do more harm than good. This project provides research training to graduate, undergraduate, and high school students.

A disaster-tolerant communication network must work despite interference among users as arises when first responders converge at a disaster site. Conventional interference avoidance methods offer diminishing capacity per user as the user density increases. Cooperative communication can solve the problem by taking advantage of the interference, thus saving total network transmit power. However, the performance of existing cooperative communication algorithms vary significantly with the channel statistics for which they are designed and, also, waste received mutual information when the channel is better than the transmission rate or suffer an outage when the channel cannot support the transmission rate. This research explores the design of a cooperative communication system, composed of single or multiple antenna nodes, that works across varying channel conditions in the sense that outage is eliminated and received mutual information is not wasted. The goal of the project is to take an information theoretic solution all the way to a single-chip implementation to advance communication and coding, as well as system-on-chip (SoC) implementation. The project tackles research problems that are at the intersection of three areas: (i) communication theory, (ii) very large-scale integration (VLSI) signal processing, and (iii) system-on-chip architecture and design.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: The project advances interdisciplinary communication system research and design. The system-on-chip realization has the potential for application in future fixed or mobile ad-hoc wireless networks with the capability to work under strong interference as required by first responders, potentially strengthening national security and emergency preparedness. The proposed project provides an educational opportunity to expose students to the diverse aspects of communication system theory and practice. It will also involve undergraduate students and students from underrepresented groups through an integrated research and education program.

The objective of this project is to consider the problem of jamming in a holistic way and design a framework towards coping with these attacks. The framework will unify the functionalities of deterring, detecting, and alleviating the effects of jamming.<br/><br/>Unlike previous efforts this research will (a) exploit physical layer capabilities such as the tunability of power/rate and the use of smart antennas to cope with jamming and (b) design solutions that are based on strong experimental foundation. Furthermore, the design will seek to address jamming attacks by not only external adversaries but also internally compromised nodes that send large volumes of seemingly legitimate data. The project will encompass the following tasks: (i) Extensive experiments to understand the impact of jamming and identification of behavioral traits during a jamming attack. (ii) Design of methods to obfuscate traffic patterns such that the jammer will be unable to target important nodes or locations in the network (iii) Use of the experimental knowhow in the design of the framework for detecting jamming attacks and (iv) Exploiting physical layer capabilities such as rate/power and smart antennas to cope with attacks.<br/><br/>This research is expected to broadly impact successful future deployments of vehicular and municipal ad hoc/mesh networks. It will also be tightly knit with educational programs that will augment wireless teaching laboratories and introduce cross-disciplinary courses that bridge the physical and higher layers.

Cross-layer design is strongly needed for such a network due to its two special features; dynamic spectrum availability and spectrum heterogeneity. Quite different from other well-studied wireless networks, such as mobile ad hoc networks and wireless sensor networks, the major concerns of WMNs are throughput, fairness, and QoS support, instead of mobility support and power efficiency.<br/><br/>The PIs plan to conduct a comprehensive study on cross-layer optimization in DSA WMNs, and design protocols under the guidance of this cross-layer optimization. They will concentrate on the bottom four layers of the network stack and seek joint congestion control, routing, spectrum sharing, and power control solutions with the objective of maximizing throughput, achieving certain fairness, and providing QoS support. Furthermore, the research will be conducted under various network models including different interference models, different traffic models, and different fairness models.<br/><br/>The INTELLECTUAL MERIT of the project includes (1) a unified mathematical model which precisely characterizes all important features and the formal formulations of the cross-layer optimization problems under different network models, (2) centralized and distributed algorithms for solving the optimization problems, and (3) a spectrum-aware routing protocol.<br/><br/>The BROADER IMPACT of the project includes (1) novel cross-layer schemes for emerging DSA WMNs, with impact on the advancement of information technology, (2) high quality publications and training of highly skilled students, and (3) possible impact on the standardization in IETF and IEEE for DSA wireless networks in the future.

Conformational equilibria refer to ensemble average properties and spontaneous fluctuations of IDPs in their native milieus. Important biological functions are associated with intrinsic disorder. These include molecular recognition, self-assembly, post-translational modifications, and entropic machines. The question of how IDPS use disorder in function will remain unanswered pending the availability of accurate, quantitative physical models for conformational equilibria of IDPs. Most IDPs are deficient in hydrophobic residues and are rich in charged and polar residues and therefore they are akin to polyampholytes and polyelectrolytes. Research goals will be accomplished using a combination of techniques including molecular simulations, theoretical approaches based on polymer physics, and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. The studies will cover a range of IDPs, which differ in their overall hydrophobicity, charge asymmetry, and sequence complexity. Results of these studies will lead to an improved mechanistic understanding of how IDPs use disorder for function. Recent data from the PI's group shows that backbones of generic polypeptides behave like chains in poor solvents in physiological milieus. This observation implies that theories for polyelectrolytes and polyampholytes in poor solvents provide the appropriate conceptual framework for developing quantitative models for conformational equilibria of IDPs. This project will test the hypothesis that IDPs assume conformations akin to so-called necklace globules, which is expected of polyampholytes and polyelectrolytes in poor solvents.<br/><br/>Research on IDPs is a major growth area in protein biophysics. The PI's group is developing important tools for the simulation and analysis of conformational and phase equilibria of IDPs. As part of this project, the PI will disseminate these tools to the community, and continue the tradition of using these tools to collaborate with experimentalists. The PI has taken active interest in promoting the cause of IDPs as a major area of research in molecular biophysics. The PI played an important role in helping to draft the statement-of-significance to convince the Biophysical Society's council to create a special subgroup within the society for the discussion of issues central to research on IDPs. The PI is a member of the Biophysics steering committee at Washington University. In this role, the PI is developing stronger ties between biophysics and bioengineering, especially focusing on the areas of IDP function and self-assembly. The PI is also actively involved with the McDonnell International Scholars program at Washington University. One of the goals of this program is to be proactive about recruiting top-flight graduate students and postdoctoral fellows to join research programs at Washington University and contribute to a rich and diverse intellectual environment.

As a consequence, computer scientists have developed techniques that deliver improved average-case performance and/or design convenience at the expense of timing predictability. For embedded software, which interacts closely with physical processes, timing is usually an essential property. Lack of timing in the core abstractions results in brittle and non-portable designs. Moreover, as embedded software becomes more networked, the prevailing empirical test-based approach to achieving real-time computing becomes inadequate.<br/><br/>This project reintroduces timing predictability as a first-class property of embedded processor architectures. It tackles the problem from the hardware design perspective, developing precision timed (PRET) machines as soft cores on FPGAs. It shows that software on PRET machines can be integrated with what would traditionally have been purely hardware designs. This project seeks to reinvigorate research in an area of computer science and computer architecure that have stagnated in research due to maturing industrial practice. This is expected to provide a starting point for a decades-long revolution that will once again make timing predictability an essential feature of processors. This project addresses the core abstractions of computing. Rather than attempting to correct the lack of timing in these abstractions with more layers of abstraction, this project has the goal of showing that embedded processors can deliver both predictable timing and high performance. It opens up the field to new computing abstractions that include timing as a first-class property.

The main objective of this proposal is to investigate a novel method of achieving ultra high resolution, high speed, in-vivo cancer imaging based on common-path endoscopic optical coherence tomography (EOCT). The EOCT approach is aimed at improving the accuracy of biopsy site selection and increasing the resolution of noninvasive optical biopsy for detection of cervical, colon, and rectal cancers. The proposed work is in harmony with the ultrahigh-resolution fiber-optic confocal microscopy work being recently conducted at the FDA/CDRH Division of Physics' Laboratory of Optical Therapeutics and Medical Nanophotonics. A full system analysis using a set of preliminary studies will be conducted to validate this technique for fast and reliable imaging of cancerous tissues.<br/><br/>The proposed research could resolve some of the critical issues associated with the current endoscopic OCT imaging technology. The high-resolution, real-time optical imaging technology can become a powerful non-invasive optical biopsy technique, enabling assessment of tissue microstructures for early detection of various diseases (such as GI cancer, bladder and cervical cancers etc) without the need for tissue removal. The potential impact on healthcare can be significant. Also, the education plan of the project includes training graduate and undergraduate students, and offers them with an advanced, hands-on engineering-oriented environment. The project also offers an excellent opportunity for tightening the collaboration between researchers with different expertise and promoting the effective use of the existing infrastructures at different institutions and government agencies.

0723425	RIG/CAA: Contributions of Photoreceptor Spectral Sensitivities and Post-Receptoral Processing to Primate Color Perception	IOS	BROADENING PARTICIPATION	09/01/2007	08/14/2007	Manoel Rowe	CA	University of California-Santa Barbara	Standard Grant	Mark Kirk	08/31/2009	$155,250.00		MickeyPRowe@gmail.com	Office of Research	Santa Barbara	CA	931062050	8058934188	BIO	7487	1096, 7487, 9183, BIOT	$0.00	Animals extract information from their environment through sets of sensory cells. The responses of these cells are processed by other cells in the animals'' nervous systems, but post-receptoral processing cannot add information. Hence optimal performance is set by the characteristics of receptors. Such thinking underlies a common argument put forth to compare the capabilities of animals with different receptors: since receptors determine the limits of performance, little or nothing need be known about post-receptoral processing to know an animal''s perceptual capabilities. The present set of experiments are designed to test the validity of this argument. For color vision, spectral sensitivity -- the ability to absorb light as a function of wavelength -- is a receptor''s defining characteristic. Abnormalities in the set of receptor spectral sensitivities is the cause of most congenital color vision deficiencies in humans. If the response properties of receptors determine the limits of performance, then the capabilities of humans with different color vision phenotypes should be fully predictable from receptor spectral sensitivities alone. In this research, human subjects with various forms of color vision deficiency diagnosed through visual testing and DNA sequencing will be compared to others with normal color vision. Subjects will be asked to make perceptual judgments and will be tested for their abilities to make color discriminations. Both types of measure will be used to make inferences about the processing of information provided by the receptors. If post-receptoral processing can be neglected in characterizing color vision performance, then color vision deficiencies can be simulated by presenting normal subjects with stimuli that produce in their receptors the same responses that occur in the receptors of color vision deficient humans. If color vision deficiencies cannot be so readily simulated, one can conclude that the argument presented above - that receptor spectral sensitivities determine perceptual capabilities - is wrong. Such a finding would have major implications for the study of comparative color vision. This project will broaden minority participation by enabling the PI, himself of hispanic heritage, the opportunity to develop tools and acquire preliminary data that will make future grant applications more competitive. In addition, the PI will mentor interns in the California Alliance for Minority Participation, a program supported in part by the Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation at NSF.

Schaffner	12/31/2008	$9,000.00		kschultz@stanford.edu	3160 Porter Drive	Palo Alto	CA	943041212	6507232300	SBE	1371	9179, SMET	$0.00	For the past decade, much research in international relations has studied the effects of domestic political institutions upon foreign policy decisions and outcomes. One particularly fruitful line of research has focused on the domestic political incentives of leaders and how these differ between democratic and non-democratic regimes. Scholars, however, have paid surprisingly little attention to the remarkable variation among non-democracies in both their domestic institutional structures and their foreign policy behaviors. The question of why some non-democracies pursue belligerent foreign policies, while others maintain peaceful and cooperative relations with the international community remains a woefully under-researched question in the political science literature. <br/><br/>This dissertation sheds light on the domestic politics of foreign policy in non-democratic states and challenges the conventional wisdom about the relationship between regime type and conflict, questioning the assumption that democratic institutions are the primary way that leaders can be held accountable by domestic groups. It does so by focusing on differences in leader accountability in non-democratic regimes and how the possibility of domestic punishment affects the foreign policy calculations of leaders of non-democratic nations. It draws on recent work on non-democracies from comparative politics that highlights the importance of politics within the ruling elite and develops a rigorous theory of accountability that generates falsifiable hypotheses about variation in foreign policies, including war participation, war-winning, punishment after war, and the ability of leaders to communicate credibly in international politics. The project uses both case study and quantitative analysis of domestic political characteristics to test these hypotheses. The Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grant would fund research assistants to help in the construction of a dataset of autocratic regime characteristics.<br/><br/>Broader Implications. The dissertation promises to generate insights of interest to policy-makers dealing with non-democracies in foreign relations. Explaining how domestic politics affect the incentives of leaders not subject to elections and parliaments is crucial for policymakers who seek ways to forge lasting international agreements, interpret threats and promises, and cooperate with non-democratic states such as Iran, North Korea, and China.

The historical study of the scientific investigations of race-crossing conducted between 1910 and 1940 is long overdue. During this period there were more than twenty major scientific investigations of the effects of miscegenation in the Pacific, North America, Southeast Asia, South Africa and the Maghreb. This study concentrates largely on the extensive and influential series of studies of race mixing organized through the Department of Anthropology at Harvard University, one of the major pre-World War II sites for the training of physical anthropologists. That is, it is primarily an examination of the network of Harvard anthropologists conducting studies of frontier biology in the Pacific and elsewhere, tracing their miscegenation map of the new world. In the three years of the project the principal investigator will undertake data collection (including visits to the sites of investigation), analysis, and the writing of a monograph on the science of race mixing in the twentieth century, and associated articles.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit. Most histories of race science are histories of ideas, but this project examines the actual practices of scientific investigation and reconstructs the interactions and engagements that occurred in fieldwork. This study is methodologically innovative in that it calls for the historian to follow scientists as they move between, or make comparisons between, multiple sites. During the past twenty years, historians have attempted to situate scientific practice in specific social circumstances. But having thus situated science, how then does one account for its travel and stabilization in diverse locations? How did the character of the interactions between investigators and local inhabitants vary from place to place? How do practices and observations become commensurate and comparable at different sites? Through trans-national studies such as this, we will begin to understand how scientists can make global claims on bodies and their environments.<br/><br/>Broader Impact. One of the project's goals is to find out what happens to our understanding of race in the twentieth century when the extensive inter-war scientific research on miscegenation is included in its history. Importantly, this study brings Australasia and the Pacific into focus in the history of twentieth-century race science. Doing so will shift our impressions of the contours of the scientific investigation of human diversity. It adds to our knowledge of the causes of the decline of race in science and adjusts the conventional periodization of this decline. This study will provide a critical history of the racialization and deracialization of children of mixed parentage in twentieth-century biological sciences. It will also explain how the Pacific Islanders of Hawaii and (increasingly) the west coast of the U.S. figured in twentieth-century race science. The results of this work will help to inform and expand the American Anthropological Association's Race and Human Variation project (which is supported by the National Science Foundation and Ford Foundation), contributing to the reshaping of the dialogue on race in the United States.

A model seminar curriculum developed by a team of professional ethicists and GIS&T educators will be developed and disseminated freely to the GIS&T education community in the U.S. and overseas. This project addresses the fact that GIS&T is a large and rapidly-growing multidisciplinary field concerned with the nature, use, and societal impacts of information derived from geospatial technologoes. Technologies such as the Global Positioning System (GPS), satellite remote sensing, and geographic information systems (GIS) enable analysts to track people and tehings, to evaluate natural resources and monitor land uses, to identify optimal sites and routes, and to target areas for further investigation or intervention. As such, ethical issues related to: 1) privacy of individuals and use of geospatial technologies as surveillance tools; 2) appropriate use of data collected using these methods for policy decisions; and, 3) consequences of inequities that arise through biased access to geospatial tools and derived data. A panel of ethicists and educators will be convened to develop a seminar curriculum that engages students in the philosophical foundations of ethics, in echniques for assessing and strengthening moral reasoning ability, and the ethical issues associated with GIS&T. Student interactions with GIS&T professionals will be used to develop case studies that illuminate practical situations and professional responses to them. The curriculum will be widely disseminated through the Association of American Geographers and through virtual seminars at PSU.

However, current technologies do not provide satisfactory performance in terms of capacity, connectivity, and delay. Recently, several cooperation schemes have been proposed to improve the network performance. They significantly depart from the traditional point-to-point link abstraction and conventional network architectures and will have a profound impact on the network performance and design.<br/><br/>The goal of this research is to develop the foundations and practical algorithms for applying emerging cooperation schemes in wireless ad hoc networks. These schemes include (i) cooperative communications where multiple nodes intentionally transmit concurrently at the physical layer, for example, cooperative diversity, distributed multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), and distributed beamforming, (ii) network coding where nodes combine data received from neighbors and then transmit these combinations to their neighbors to reduce the number of transmissions and improve throughput, (iii) cooperative infrastructure where infrastructure (e.g., wired base stations) is overlaid over wireless ad hoc networks. This research will develop fundamental performance bounds for cooperative networks, as well as new algorithms and mechanisms for providing network-level services.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of this project include the dissemination of research results through journal and conference publications, and a strong education component that promotes teaching, training, and learning through the active involvement of research students. Education materials will be developed and disseminated for a new course to be taught jointly at the two universities.

They are used routinely to constrain the subsurface geometry of active faults, to infer the spatial distribution of coseismic slip, and to study the response of the elastic crust to magma intrusion preceding volcanic eruptions. These data are the primary means for recording aseismic processes such as afterslip, viscoelastic and poroelastic adjustments and silent earthquakes. Accurate measurements of inflationary doming and stretching of the crust help in the forecasting of volcanic activity. Similar data play an important role in quantifying the kinematics of active landslides.<br/><br/>Using modern information theory, the investigators have generalized persistent scatterer techniques for InSAR, a visual geodetic technique that permits detailed mapping of motion over wide areas and exposes complex deformation patterns. Their technique helps to find stable points in natural terrain which can be used as a network of fiducial points in otherwise poor-quality interferograms. This will help extend InSAR analysis to heavily vegitated areas. The investigators are applying their new techniques to the San Francisco Bay segment of the San Andreas Fault and Hayward Fault. Their obervations will help follow the earthquake cycle in more areas and may compliment geodetic measurement of volcanoes, as well as improve InSAR capabilities in many other applications. <br/><br/>The Broader Impacts of the project include adding more information to assess natural hazards, like earthquakes, volcanoes and landslides, in a variety of terrains, training of graduate students in these methods and making software and algorithms freely available to interested researchers.
0721550	NOSS: Sensor Data Ghosting: A Framework for the Survival of Critical Data under Sensor Failures	CNS	RES IN NETWORKING TECH & SYS	09/01/2007	07/31/2009	Hayder Radha	MI	Michigan State University	Continuing grant	Min Song	08/31/2011	$350,000.00		radha@egr.msu.edu	Office of Sponsored Programs	East Lansing	MI	488242600	5173555040	CSE	7363	7363, 7390, 9218, HPCC	$0.00	The survival of critical sensor data that is collected during manmade or natural disasters is arguably more important than traditional sensor-network design objectives, such as prolonging the sensors' lifetime. Under this project, a sensor data ghosting framework is being developed. This framework creates minimal data redundancy, known as sensor data ghosts, which roam around the sensor network toward a sink. Under sensor failures, the data ghosts are expedited toward the sink for their timely recovery. Recovery of the sensor data at the sink becomes feasible due to the availability of just enough data (generated due to data ghosting). <br/>Coding and networking solutions are being developed and integrated in a synergetic manner to achieve sensor data survivability and persistence. In particular, network coding approaches that map efficient channel codes over network graphs are being developed. On the networking side, a novel topology evolution solution that is capable of reacting rapidly to random failures and providing expedited delivery of critical data to the sink is being researched. This topology evolution approach rearranges a traditional sensor-network geometric topology toward a small-world network topology, which allows a small number of long-haul shortcuts toward the sink. Related networking research, such as directed diffusion and prioritized forwarding, is also being investigated under topology evolution. In addition to enabling new levels of sensor data survivability, this project has significantly broader theoretical and practical impact than the target sensor application. This includes the development of new types of codes on network graphs and approaches in adaptive network topologies.

Princeton	NJ	085442020	6092583090	CSE	7364	7364, 9216, HPCC	$0.00	The goal of the proposed research is to create analytical and computational tools that explicitly address the time and order of social interactions between individuals. The proposed approach combines ideas from social network analysis, Internet computing, distributed computing, and machine learning to solve problems in population biology. The diverse computational tasks of this project include design of algorithmic techniques to identify social entities such as a communities, leaders, and followers, and to use these structures to predict social response patterns to danger or disturbances. Nowhere is the impact of social structure likely to be greater than when species come in<br/>contact with predators. Thus, the accuracy and predictive power of the proposed computational tools will be tested by characterizing the social structure of horses and zebras (equids) both before and after human- or predator-induced perturbations to the social network. The proposed interdisciplinary research will have broader impacts on a wide range of research communities. New methods for analysis of social interactions in animal populations will be useful for behavioral biologists in such diverse fields as behavioral ecology, animal husbandry, conservation biology, and disease ecology. The machine learning algorithms that will be develop are relevant to many studies in which researchers need to classify temporal interaction data. The proposed network methods have broader relevance to human societies: disease transmission, dissemination<br/>of ideas, and social response to crises are all dynamic processes occurring via social networks. Further, through teaching and participation in outreach, students and school teachers will gain access to opportunities for hands-on, interdisciplinary experiences in a new area of computational biology. The research and software resulting from the proposed project will be disseminated both in computational and biological communities and enhanced by cross-disciplinary training activities and will serve to train a new generation of interdisciplinary scientists.

The work involves <br/>. Addressing the needs of commercial platforms that often do not allow any changes in the underlying framework and seldom provide researchers full control of the RF, PHY, and lower MAC functionalities. <br/>. Obtaining new and realistic models for spectrum hole detection and spectrum usage pattern providing real data depicting trend and patterns of spectrum usage which will contribute significantly in building prototypes (Simulation results are only as good as the models that use them.)<br/>. Recreating concepts from a model of primary users studying the characteristics in licensed bands and then recreating those primary users in the ISM bands by emulating their characteristics for testing the dynamic spectrum access algorithms.<br/>Intelligent cognitive radios sniff the radio frequency (RF) medium and identify bands of unused spectrum. These bands are then scavenged and information can be transmitted over them utilizing orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) loading possibly non-contiguous bands of available frequencies. Federal Communication Commission (FCC) has recognized the importance of cognitive radio in spectrum management in the coming years, and has even opened the television band for the purpose of cognitive radio networks. Thus, the project creates a hardware platform to investigate cognitive radio systems and builds a test bed to analyze the physical, MAC, routing and transport layers to enable research in the area. The models are developed for hole detection and spectrum usage patterns. The overall approach combines modeling and re-creation (in the ISM bands) via emulation.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: This test bed enables many applications such as pervasive networks, remote patient monitoring, inter-vehicular communications, emergency communications, airborne networks, and surveillance systems. Dissemination of results should have major impact on research and development in the areas of cognitive radio networks. Research will be transferred to wireless communication industry on San Diego through SDSU's industry partnerships. Curricular improvements are expected to enhance the technological skills and employment prospects of students (many from underrepresented groups).

Storrs	CT	062691133	8604863622	GEO	1670	0000, OTHR	$0.00	The atmosphere is the most important source of mercury (Hg) to the marine environment and air-sea exchange is a major pathway for both the addition and removal of Hg from the atmosphere. Preliminary data suggests that the cycling of Hg at the air-sea interface is a complex process involving abiotic (photochemical) oxidation of elemental Hg (Hg0) and reduction of ionic Hg (HgII) in surface waters, as well as oxidation of Hg0 in the atmospheric boundary layer. <br/><br/>A scientist from the University of Connecticut plans to assess the importance of these processes by determining the variation in the speciation of Hg and other ancillary measurements in atmospheric and surface water samples recovered from one site in the North Atlantic near Bermuda and another from Cape Point, South Africa. The resulting data set would be used to test the following three hypotheses: (1) photochemical oxidation of Hg0 in surface seawater occurs but the overall net reaction is HgII reduction; (2) organic matter is the primary dissolved constituent influencing the rate of HgII reductions in surface seawater; and (3) oxidation of Hg0 in the marine boundary layer and subsequent dry deposition of HgII compounds is substantial and rivals that of wet deposition. Controlled incubation experiments would also be carried out to determine redox transformations in surface waters. Lastly, the data from the project would be used to constrain and improve ocean and global Hg models, as well as incorporate their results into model simulations using the Harvard University GEOS-Chem modeling framework. <br/><br/>As regards broader impacts, this study would further our understanding of the Hg cycle. This study would allow U.S. scientists to interact with their counterparts in South Africa and would continue to build international collaborations with South African institutions. One postdoc, one graduate student, and one undergraduate student would be supported and trained as part of this project.

A high resolution digital camera will provide time-series images of the sediment surface area that contributes to the flux. <br/><br/>The new system for measuring Benthic OXygen Exchange Rate (BOXER) will be utilized in a completely autonomous mode during this project but will also be designed to receive power and transmit data if connected through cables to a benthic node of a coastal observatory. BOXER measurements will be performed at least seasonally between July 2008 and December 2009, but also over shorter time-scales during parts of the year. By coordinating these measurements with a network of other oceanographic observations and field programs, The PIs will address the hypothesis that benthic exchange rates are temporally variable and controlled predictably by forcing events such as the spring transition (wind) and onset of plankton blooms associated with upwelling events (carbon flux). <br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/><br/>The combined measurements proposed here and the connection to and collaboration with other projects focusing on the Oregon Continental Shelf will provide new valuable information on the oxygen and carbon exchange dynamics for the Shelf. This work represent a pioneering effort in adapting eddy-correlation to long term monitoring facilities, which is the only way to get in depth insight on seasonal element cycling in these important environments. The project has high potential to serve as a platform for education and training of students. The PI has an excellent track record of training excellent scientists. Hosting REU students and integrating some of this work into a marine technology class nicely compliment the standard graduate training.

The separate steps of C-H activation via oxidative addition and C-C bond formation via reductive elimination are the essential steps set forth for realizing C-H to C-C transformations in this system. This project utilizes PCP pincer ligated Ir complexes as the preferred platform for C-H activation, and new Ru complexes will be designed to accomplish related C-H activation and C-C bond forming reactions. The mechanistic details of reductive elimination to form new C-C bonds are being probed in this study in order to establish guidelines for promoting carbon-carbon bond formation.<br/><br/>Since C-H bonds are ubiquitous in organic compounds they provide a rich source for carbon-carbon framework constructions by activation and manipulation of these relatively inert bonds. The broader impacts of this project include educational benefits for all levels of participants, from high school through graduate students, that include computational skills, experimentally sophisticated synthetic techniques, and opportunities to build expertise with a combination of inorganic and organic mechanistic probes.

This is a statistical study aimed at improving analysis of spectroscopic data. These activities fall in the specialized field called chemometrics. The idea is to develop multivariate calibration, which is of interest when the number of predictors exceeds the number of samples (p>n, rather than the usual assumption n>>p). Professor Kalivas proposes three new model approaches that address the general problem of the transfer of a calibration model developed on one instrument to other instruments, or the problem of building a calibration model for several instruments.<br/><br/>All three models are based on Tikhonov Regularization. Each uses both variance and bias to address the two issues of harmony and harmony/parsimony balance. The work is being done by undergraduates using the program MATLAB.<br/><br/>Efficiency and effectiveness of data analysis is becoming increasingly important in all of the quantitative sciences, including biology. The integration of state of the art statistical methods within the natural science disciplines is required for advancement in these fields. Education of undergraduates in these advanced methods prepare them for any type of scientific professional pursuit.

While much work in the last two decades has focused on the case in which the attractor of the <br/>IFS is a fractal with non-integral Hausdorff dimension, the investigators study IFSs with overlap. In the one-dimensional <br/>setting, the measures associated with these attractors are Erdos's self-similar convolution measures; in general the measures <br/>are invariant Hutchinson measures. Almost nothing is known about orthonormal bases associated with Hutchinson <br/>measures in the case of non-finite overlap, and in fact previous work of the investigators and P. Jorgensen has shown that <br/>the measures in the overlap cases have different properties from the non-overlap measures. The proposed work on IFSs is <br/>an exciting branch of harmonic analysis which connects to fractals, wavelets, and random walks; it also has applications to <br/>number theory, dynamics, and combinatorial geometry. The investigators draw on methods from all these fields in their <br/>work. The work in this proposal will involve further collaborations with P. Jorgensen at the University of Iowa. <br/><br/>Iterated function systems (IFSs) embody the common themes of recursion and self-similarity. The investigators will study <br/>properties of IFSs and their associated geometry. In fact, a central theme in this work is the interplay between geometry and <br/>spectral analysis on fractals. There is a natural tension between studying fractals from a geometric point of view and from a <br/>spectral point of view; traditional time-frequency methods used in spectral analysis are linear, and the systems the <br/>investigators study are non-linear. The need to understand non-linear phenomena is motivated by a host of real-life <br/>applications. IFSs occur repeatedly in signal processing and communications. For example, wavelets, the key behind the <br/>JPEG 2000 compression standard, are a particular example of an IFS. Applications of iterated function systems extend far <br/>beyond communications---IFSs are used in data compression, quantum computing, pattern recognition, DNA computations, <br/>and a vast array of other fields. Furthermore, due to its wide applicability, work in this proposal will draw undergraduate <br/>students into mathematical research. The investigators will conduct research with undergraduates at Grinnell College, and <br/>published work by P. Jorgensen and the investigators has already been incorporated into research projects for <br/>undergraduates at the University of Iowa, as part of the Alliances for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (AGEP <br/>Alliance) and the Heartland Mathematics Partnership.

The results should improve estimates of rates and timings of a wide range of Earth system processes by at least an order of magnitude. Project activities will be coordinated with more than a dozen international partners and will utilize the expertise of the Cretaceous, Jurassic, and Triassic subcommissions of the International Commission on Stratigraphy. The grand team goal is to extend the ATS, now virtually complete for the Cenozoic Era (0 to 65 million years ago), to encompass the past 250 million years. The methods that underpin the Cenozoic ATS will be applied to the Mesozoic. Emphasis will be placed on the goodness of fit of stratigraphic signals to astronomical models, duplication of records from different regions, and high-resolution calibration to geomagnetic polarity signatures and integrated bio- and chemostratigraphy. To aid in the science, a universally accessible signal processing toolbox will be created to modernize and unite leading statistical time series techniques used in cyclostratigraphic research, as well as in many other geoscience fields. Numerical ages from the reconstructed ATS will be inter-calibrated with other dating techniques in conjunction with NSF's EARTHTIME Project. All data and tools will be documented and accessible through multiple NSF public database systems, including GEON, CHRONOS, PaleoStrat, PBDB, and others. This project fulfills an ongoing global community initiative to develop a continuous, astronomical-calibrated, International Geologic Time Scale for the past quarter billion years of Earth history.

With advance notification of traffic congestion, drivers could make educated decisions about taking alternate routes, thus saving time and fuel. Recently, systems using vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) that employ vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications have been proposed for this purpose. Unfortunately, relying solely on V2V communications has the undesired side effect of inviting the introduction of false alerts and misleading messages.<br/><br/>This project takes a novel look at solving the problem of propagating traffic-related information in VANETs in a secure and privacy-preserving manner. The goal of this project is to develop and evaluate an architecture for the Notification of Traffic Incidents and Congestion (NOTICE). NOTICE consists of sensor belts embedded in the roadway at regular intervals. Vehicles passing over a belt will provide information about their travel directly to the belt. The collective information stored by the belts will be used to make intelligent inferences about the occurrence of traffic incidents. NOTICE will provide secure and privacy-preserving communications between vehicles and the belts, efficiently propagate incident information to vehicles, and infer the presence of traffic congestion without driver intervention.<br/><br/>The results of this research will be disseminated through journal and conference publications. The broader impacts of this project include providing a basis for a deployable incident notification system and the development of new courses in vehicular networks, sensor networks, security, and embedded and distributed systems.

In some languages different voice qualities can distinguish word meanings, so each speaker must control multiple patterns of vibration. This project studies how speakers of different languages produce such voice contrasts when speaking, and how they perceive them when listening. Physiological recordings, acoustic measurements, and perceptual responses are analyzed to uncover the overall multi-dimensional phonetic space for voice, and to determine which subpart of that overall space each language uses. <br/><br/>The interdisciplinary research team for the project offers a unique approach to understanding linguistic voice quality, combining linguistic phonetics, voice science, and electrical engineering. Semi-automation of acoustic measurements of voice samples, with new algorithms for recovering voice properties from standard audio recordings, allows large-scale data collection and analysis. These tools will be made available publicly for use by other researchers. The cross-language perspective of the project takes advantage of the many languages spoken in the Los Angeles area. The results of the project will be relevant for (1) describing languages, including documenting endangered languages; (2) high-quality synthesis of a wide range of normal voice qualities; (3) use of voice information in automatic speech recognition; (4) speaker (voice) recognition; (5) sociolinguistic study of voice quality variation as a function of linguistic/regional/social groups, including in bilingual populations; (6) study of voice quality variation with affect, emotion, etc.; (7) second-language learning of language-specific voice quality.

This dramatic restructuring of embryo morphology involves epiboly, a process by which the embryonic cell mass spreads over the surface of the yolk. Epiboly is followed by gastrulation, a large-scale rearrangement of tissues leading to formation of germ layers that ultimately give rise to all the organs and tissues of the body. An important focus of developmental biology research is to understand the molecular mechanisms controlling epiboly and gastrulation. Using molecular genetic approaches, Dr Garrity's and Dr Horne's laboratories recently identified the calcium channel beta subunit as essential for normal epiboly in zebrafish. Classically, the beta subunit is thought to function as a critical auxiliary subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs), multi-protein complexes that mediate calcium entry into the cell. The auxiliary beta subunits (beta1- beta4) help transport the pore-forming alpha1 subunit to the cell membrane and modulate the electrophysiological properties of the calcium channel. However, recent research suggests that beta subunits may have additional functions in the cell independent of their roles in VGCCs. Mutations in the beta subunit lead to uncoordinated, lethargic behavior and seizures in mice, and have been associated with epilepsy in humans. Ongoing research in Dr Garrity's and Dr Horne's laboratories will use a combination of molecular genetic and biochemical approaches to test potential roles for the beta subunit in interacting with cytoskeletal components or in cell division or differentiation. The proposed research in zebrafish is expected to define new cellular roles for the beta subunit family, which could extend to other cell types in different physiological contexts, and may lead to a better understanding of disease phenotypes in mice and humans. The research will also contribute to our basic understanding of the molecular mechanisms driving epiboly. This collaboration will provide training and research opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students on two campuses, utilizing video conferencing. It will also provide summer internship opportunities for minority undergraduate students enrolled at Colorado State University-Pueblo, an affiliated Hispanic Serving Institution.

Electron cryo-microscopy (cryoEM) is the most appropriate structural tool to determine molecular structures of biological nanomachines that generally consist of multiple protein subunits and/or nucleic acids with a total mass greater than 0.5 million Daltons. The goal is to develop information discovery and integration methodologies for deriving atomic models of nanomachines. Such models will be derived from 3-dimensional (3-D) cryoEM mass density function (i.e. a volumetric density map) in conjunction with physics of protein folding and informatics data. This project is made possible by an integration of the expertise of five investigators in computer graphics, computational biophysics, structural informatics and cryoEM. The intellectual merit of this research is highlighted by the computational approaches of extracting structural information from low-resolution, complex cryoEM volume densities and integrating this information into classical protein structure modeling paradigms, such as comparative modeling and ab initio modeling, for understanding biological nanomachines. The three research goals involve information discovery, information integration and validation of the proposed algorithms. The proposed research will have significant impacts in three disparate disciplines: computer science, molecular modeling, and cryoEM. Furthermore, the team will disseminate their resulting tools freely to the academic community and will host a workshop towards the end of the project. To enhance the impact of their research, the investigators will integrate research with education at each member institution with an eye towards diversity. In particular, these investigators will develop a virtual didactic course in modeling of biological nanomachines for graduate and senior undergraduate students at the five participating institutions.

The workshop will focus on two over-arching themes: property and sovereignty. These substantive issues will provide a practical context in which to consider the workshops broader concerns with issues of representation, and governance of genomic research. The last decade witnessed significant institutional changes in the governance of human population genomics. Following the controversies surrounding the Human Genome Diversity Project, many policy makers and scientists recognized that if genomic ideas and practices might impinge upon the capability of people to define themselves in ways that are politically, socially and culturally important, then those people should have a say in whether and how that research moves forward. This change is particularly evident in the recent history of interactions between genomics researchers and tribes. As domestic, dependent nations in a trust relationship with the United States government, tribes enjoy special rights?in particular, the right to determine their membership. Genome scientists and policy makers' recognize that these rights must be recognized, but considerable uncertainty surrounds efforts to work out what this means in practice. Although scientists and policy makers alike often express a commendable desire to address the specific issues raised by tribal sovereignty, a thorough analysis of the issues at stake has yet to take place. A workshop proceedings, the formation of a research agenda, and a policy white paper will be the products. The workshop proceedings will be a multi-authored work that takes account of indigenous values surrounding knowledge production, namely concerns about privacy, authorship, and control in setting research agendas. This methodology is both consistent with emerging work on indigenous methods, and develops it in a North American context by directing attention to overarching policy concerns informed by the existing domestic structure of law and policy. The intellectual merit of the workshop lies in forging intellectual ties between science and technology studies and indigenous and native studies. Forging these links promises new insights into the possible meanings and forms democratic governance of research might take in colonial and post-colonial contexts. The project's broader impacts will include contributions to science and to policy. A greater understanding of the conceptual and practical problems that underlie efforts to govern genomic research in a manner that respects tribal sovereignty rights has the potential to influence research design, and to strengthen the roles tribes can play in directing this research for positive ends.

The goal of the workshop is to bring together microbiologists, ecologists, marine biologists, bioinformaticians, and computer scientists to explore the scope of future microbial and marine sciences cyberinfrastructure needs, and strategies for its maintenance. The workshop will be held September 9-11, 2007 at the National Science Foundation Headquarters in Arlington, VA. It will examine four issues critical to the development of a successful microbial cyberinfrastructure: What are the large-scale biological and oceanographic questions that will be enabled by the computational advances of a microbial cyberinfrastructure? How can cumulative knowledge of microbial biology be captured and integrated within the structure of a microbial cyberinfrastructure? What types of accompanying metadata will best enhance the value of genomic and metagenomic data? What lessons can be learned from pioneering efforts to construct biological cyberinfrastructures? This workshop follows a highly successful initial workshop held May 12-13, 2005 in Bremen, Germany entitled: Genomic Approaches for Studying the Marine Environment and Resources. Like that workshop, it is envisioned that the 2007 meeting will facilitate collaboration and bring synergy and synthesis to the participants, and will result in a report to be published by the US-EC Task Force on Biotechnology Research. <br/><br/>The workshop includes scientists of diverse backgrounds, scientifically and internationally, and will promote international collaboration in the marine and microbial sciences at a very high level.

Yellen	01/31/2009	$15,000.00		drennan@pitt.edu	University Club	Pittsburgh	PA	152132303	4126247400	SBE	1391	9179, SMET	$0.00	Under the supervision of Dr. Robert Drennan, doctoral candidate William Locascio will conduct archaeological excavations at the site of He-4, in the Rio Parita Valley, Panama. He-4 emerged as a regional political center at about 550 A.D. and controlled a population numbering several thousand people. It is not fully understood why, after millennia of existing successfully in small egalitarian groups, humans in many places in the world began to organize themselves into larger, hierarchically ordered societies. What conditions existed to permit small groups of emerging elites to cement enduring social superiority? What strategies did they employ in gaining their status?<br/><br/>He-4 presents an opportunity to investigate the underlying social dynamics of this fundamental social transformation. Previous research at He-4 suggests that specialized production of agricultural tools like stone axes, which were vital for clearing forests to open agricultural fields, formed one avenue for prospective elites to consolidate social and economic control over others. Mr. Locascio will carry out excavations in areas of He-4 known to contain concentrated evidence of the production of stone axes (as well as other goods) in association with the remains of higher status residences. The earlier research involved only surface collection and very limited test excavation and thus enables one only to determine that several kinds of specialized production occurred in the same residential zones that show evidence of high ranking families. The larger-scale stratigraphic excavations that Mr. Locascio will conduct will provide much better chronological control and greater detail about the contexts in which evidence of both specialized production and social elites appears. This will make it possible to say just when specialized craft production began, what craft products were involved, how intensively specialized the production was at different points in time, and whether the nature of its association with elites changed through time.<br/><br/>In addition to its scientific findings, this research will have several kinds of broader impacts. It will be a fundamental element in the training of the doctoral candidate. It will also provide field training and experience for students of archaeology from the University of Pittsburgh and several universities in the region (including the universities of Costa Rica and Panama and the Universidad del Cauca in Colombia), thus encouraging the development of international collegial relationships in Central America and northern South America. Local outreach communicating the nature and results of the project, focusing especially on schools and communities near He-4, will enhance public appreciation of scientific archaeological research in a region where uncontrolled and illegal excavation has been a severe threat to archaeological sites.
0706816	Synscenelab: A statistical analysis of feasibility and computability of scene interpretation in synthetic stochastic images	DMS	STATISTICS, ROBUST INTELLIGENCE	09/15/2007	08/10/2007	Yali Amit	IL	University of Chicago	Standard Grant	Gabor J. Szekely	08/31/2011	$225,170.00		amit@galton.uchicago.edu	5801 South Ellis Avenue	Chicago	IL	606375418	7737028669	MPS	1269, 7495	0000, OTHR	$0.00	The introduction of statistical techniques in computer vision has yielded a number of interesting algorithms able to partially solve certain constrained recognition problems. However limitations on computing power and available training data impose certain difficult tradeoffs which are rarely quantified so that choices of parameters and models are typically done in an ad-hoc manner. These tradeoffs can only be quantified in a context where the statistical properties of the objects and their appearance in the images are well defined, yet this is far from the case in real images. The alternative, which is the goal of this project, is to perform an analysis of the same issues in a synthetic stochastic setting, using a generative model for images. Object classes are stochastically generated and instantiated in the images, together with clutter, occlusion and noise. The generative model should be rich enough to qualitatively pose the same problems as real images, yet sufficiently simple to enable quantitative analysis; hence this is not an attempt to synthesize real images. Questions regarding the limits of feasibility of various tasks such as detection and classification as a function of key parameters defining the generative model is analyzed quantitatively, in particular the analysis of the tradeoff between accuracy and computation time. The emphasis on integrating computation time in the analysis gives rise to new types of statistical questions, and new forms of asymptotic regimes as a function of the image resolution, the number of distinct classes and their variability. The hope is that the proposed framework will offer a setting in which systematic algorithmic choices can be made and contribute to the development of concrete computer vision algorithms.<br/><br/>Computer vision algorithms have produced some partial solutions to some constrained problems such as face detection, hand written digit recognition, or face recognition in severely restricted settings. Since a proper theoretical foundation for the field is lacking, a wide variety of algorithms have been proposed based on ad-hoc choices and it is difficult to assess what components of the different approaches are the most useful, which elements should be extended further and which elements should be dropped. The first step in laying a theoretical foundation for computer vision algorithms is a statistical description of the population of images. Since this is very hard to define the investigators propose to study a synthetically generated world of images, which is much simpler but which gives rise to qualitatively similar tradeoffs and challenges. In this synthetic setting the investigators will rigorously quantify the tradeoffs and hopefully be able to draw important conclusions with respect the algorithmic applications.

The overarching goal of these studies is focused on linking sophisticated observation of reaction dynamics with the ability to control chemical reactions either directly or indirectly. Five specific systems are proposed for study: 1) Control of Reactive Excited State Branching in Cis-Stilbene, 2) Control of Photodissociation Channels in Solution Phase, 3) Control of Excited State Branching in Pyrimidine DNA Bases, 4) 1,3-Cyclohexadiene Ring-Opening Reaction, and 5) The Pro-Vitamin D Ring-Opening Reaction. Techniques such as ultraviolet (UV) pulse shaping, excited state measurements, theoretical calculations, and multi-photon laser excitation will be employed.<br/><br/>The nature of this work is at the forefront of modern optical techniques and exposes students to state-of-the-art research in chemical physics and optical physics. Students and other research associates will have access to advanced laser pulse generation techniques. Integration with education will include augmenting the computational chemistry curriculum to include modeling and simulation of the chemical dynamics observed in ultrafast laser experiments.

Wiseman, Jr.	08/31/2010	$170,417.00		cjvdv@ku.edu	2385 IRVING HILL RD	LAWRENCE	KS	660457568	7858643441	GEO	5280	0000, 1079, OTHR	$0.00	ABSTRACT<br/>van der Veen<br/>OPP-0520427<br/><br/>Uncertainties in predicting future sea level are affected by a lack of understanding the<br/>behavior of calving glaciers. There are many examples in the geological record of calving glaciers that underwent rapid change. The best-known examples of such behavior are the Heinrich events, marking short-lived periods of significantly increased iceberg production from the Laurentide Ice Sheet. The Principal Investigators will apply a numerical model to describe and explain the observed retreat of Columbia Glacier, Alaska, and of Kangerlussuaq Glacier, Greenland. The lessons learned from studying these glaciers can be applied to other calving glaciers, to explain past changes as well as predict possible future changes. Columbia Glacier is a tidewater glacier that has been retreating at an increasing rate since the early 1980s. The period prior to, and the subsequent retreat, have been documented by aerial photogrammetry, conducted by the U.S.G.S. for about five times a year since 1976. This data set is the most complete for any calving glacier and covers both seasonal variations and long-term changes in glacier speed and geometry. Kangerlussuaq Glacier is a fast-moving calving glacier that underwent rapid thinning during the 1990s and data has been compiled on surface elevation and glacier speed from the 1930s. While not as extensive as the Columbia Glacier data set, available data are sufficient to constrain numerical models and investigate processes most likely responsible for the behavior of this outlet glacier. The most important question concerning Columbia Glacier and other calving glaciers is what processes may initiate retreat and what feedback mechanisms are important in sustaining retreat. To answer this question, the Principal Investigator proposes to adopt a heuristic approach in which the rate of iceberg production is estimated from a calving criterion. Two different formulations will be incorporated into the model and their predictions tested against the available data. Similarly, by incorporating simple yet realistic sliding relations, the model will be used to test the hypothesis that the speed up during retreat may be associated with glacier thinning and approach to flotation, lowering the effective basal pressure. Finally, he will investigate the role of sediment recycling and the formation of a terminal moraine bank, and whether this process is essential for allowing the terminus to advance down the fjord.<br/><br/>Scientific Merit: The main goal of this project is to identify processes most important in controlling the life cycle of calving glaciers, typified by a prolonged period of slow terminus advance to a relative stable terminus located at the mouth of the fjord, followed by a brief period of rapid retreat and disintegration of the lower reaches. Until now, most studies concerning tidewater glaciers have focused on specific aspects, such as calving, sediment deposition, etc., but few attempts have been made to integrate the various ideas and suggestions into a single model with applications to a well-documented glacier.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: While the proposed work focuses on Columbia Glacier primarily, better<br/>understanding of the dynamics of calving glaciers will have broader applications, in particular reducing uncertainties in future sea-level rise scenarios and the contribution of calving glaciers to this rise.

Solving such problems efficiently<br/>involves exploiting at least one of two types of naturally<br/>occurring structure, one implicit and the other explicit. These<br/>structures are related by the result that problems with<br/>explicitly known separable structure can be transformed via<br/>decomposition techniques (involving independent subproblem<br/>optimization) to equivalent nonsmooth problems with implicit<br/>VU-shape structure. For many objectives with the latter<br/>structure the investigator and his colleague undertale<br/>significant further development of a bundle-based method that<br/>employs a V-model of the objective and a U-model of an associated<br/>Lagrangian. This rapidly convergent algorithm takes advantage of<br/>past research that defined a structure that is special enough to<br/>give primal-dual tracks to minimizers and general enough to<br/>include many applications. The new work involves numerical<br/>testing on practical problems where the cutting-plane nature of<br/>subgradient bundling along with U-Hessian estimation allows our<br/>algorithm to follow a primal-dual track without having to know it<br/>explicitly. A significant component of the work is to extend the<br/>method to run on nonconvex functions and have provable<br/>convergence to stationary points.<br/><br/> The computational methods developed here are significant<br/>because they can be applied in many practical situations<br/>including some having broad societal impact. A new application<br/>involves a complicated objective that is used in many<br/>applications such as economic and geophysical modeling,<br/>computer-aided design, and image analysis. Nonsmooth<br/>optimization developments also make feasible the application of<br/>decomposition techniques to large or complicated models such as<br/>those occurring in operations management, telecommunication and<br/>traffic assignment, manufacturing, civil infrastructure design,<br/>structural engineering, finance, and strategic planning. Such<br/>models illustrate the need to make trade-off decisions when<br/>considering conflicting criteria such as simultaneously having<br/>high reliability and low cost. Such an area of application is in<br/>power system planning subject to environmental protection<br/>constraints. These problems naturally decompose into higher<br/>level problems of deciding which types of power generation plants<br/>to build and lower level ones of deciding how to best operate the<br/>various units to meet daily energy demand. Additionally, this<br/>project fits in well with ongoing efforts in high-performance<br/>computing, because future decomposition applications will utilize<br/>parallel processing or networks of computers to solve very large<br/>or complex decision-making problems.

Its aim is to enhance the nonlinear performance of ferrite garnet films by stress generation, compositional gradients and control of the surface contribution to harmonic generation in the presence of photon trapping. Special emphasis is placed on magnetization-induced second and third-harmonic generation in a photonic crystal environment. The project is a collaborative effort between Moscow State University (Oleg Aktsipetrov) and Michigan Technological University (Miguel Levy) that brings together the expertise in ultrafast nonlinear optics of the Moscow group and in integrated (on-chip) magneto-photonic crystal technology and magnetic garnet sputter film-growth of the Michigan group. The intellectual merit of the proposed activity is to bring together disparate contributions to the optical response of a materials system in order to enhance its magnetization-induced nonlinear properties. Inversion symmetry breaking responsible for surface second harmonic generation joins with the light-matter interaction enhancing properties of slow-light to produce strong nonlinear effects. Special attention is paid to increasing local non-uniformities at the unit cell level near the surface to enhance the high-order magnetic susceptibility responsible for harmonic generation. This combination of material and geometrical effects brings to bear through RF-magnetron sputter deposition and the formation of sub-micron surface structures by focused ion beam milling to leverage the strain contribution to the nonlinear response. Symmetry breaking mechanisms and other effects responsible for magnetization-induced harmonic generation are addressed experimentally and theoretically. <br/> <br/>Modern photonics and optoelectronics demand strong miniaturization of devices and increases in their operational speed and cost reduction. This activity contributes to this goal by furthering the development of new material structures with strong magnetically-induced nonlinear properties. Magnetization-induced second harmonic generation has become an extremely promising diagnostic tool for the study of grain boundaries and magnetic domain structure for novel computer memory devices based on giant magnetoresistance. This project aims to wed photon trapping and the development of novel materials systems to augment the resolution of this technology to the sub-micron regime. The project also works together with local area high-school teachers to bring information about the role of nanotechnology in optics to high school students. Michigan Tech uses its associations with schools that have high percentages of students from groups underrepresented in science and engineering to widen the scope of the outreach program of demonstrations taken to the high schools, including the Detroit Academy at Cass Technical High School and the Keweenaw Bay Indian Community in the western Upper Peninsula. The activity also involves high school women in science discovery projects in optics and magneto-optics. This effort is coordinated through the Women in Engineering Summer Youth Program offered by Michigan Tech. The international exchange of researchers from Russia and the U.S. is expected to enrich the education component for both graduate and undergraduate students participating in the project. <br/><br/>This award is co-funded with the Office of International Science and Engineering.

A strength of this project is the use of the technology in a cancer application to test drug delivery, thermal drug release, and MRI imaging. The research plan includes modeling of the nanoparticle magnetic properties, synthesis capabilities, and fabrication of various biocompatible shell materials whose surfaces can be chemically modified. <br/><br/>There are significant teaching components associated with this interdisciplinary project that will benefit high school and undergraduate students who want to learn about research and graduate students who begin their research career and collaborating faculties.

We propose to explore structure-reactivity effects of various metals, ligands, and reducing agents, as well as the effect of medium and temperature on new ATRP systems that proceed with ppm amounts of copper catalyst. <br/>The main intellectual challenge is to precisely determine kinetic and thermodynamic parameters for all elementary reactions involved and to correlate the structure of the key reagents with their reactivity. We will measure equilibrium constants, stability constants, redox potentials and halide affinities for the most active ATRP catalysts. We will also study the behavior of complexes with new multidentate ligands and with charged ligands. We will measure the extent of a plausible disproportionation and quantify interactions of reducing agents with catalysts. We will also determine rate constants of all relevant reactions. The obtained data will be used to construct a comprehensive model that can be applied under various conditions, for a large range of monomers, and for better architectural control. This will also help to expand range of polymerizable monomers and diminish concentration of transition metal catalysts. The generated knowledge will help advance organic atom transfer reactions and will also provide leads to industry for more benign ATRP processes.<br/>We anticipate that the research from this proposal will have a broad impact by educating graduate and undergraduate students as well as postdoctoral fellows. Information will be disseminated in the form of timely publications, on the internet, and through presentations at (inter)national symposia and the outreach program at Carnegie Mellon University. We continue the Controlled Radical Polymerization Consortium with ~ 15 companies that will benefit from the knowledge generated by the NSF supported activities. We expect that the proposed research to be supported by the NSF will impact not only synthetic polymer chemistry but also materials science and may lead to the development of some commercially valuable materials.

However, to date their impact<br/>has fallen short of this potential. This is not surprising; wireless sensor<br/>networks are difficult to design and program. Experts in application domains<br/>such as biology and civil engineering have neither the training in embedded<br/>system programming and design required to develop adequate wireless sensor<br/>networks, nor the time or inclination to become embedded systems designers.<br/>For wireless sensor networks to live up to their potential, they must be easy<br/>for application experts to design and program instead of requiring embedded<br/>systems design expertise.<br/><br/>This project seeks to put wireless sensor network design and deployment within<br/>the reach of applications experts. This project will identify a small set of<br/>application archetypes, described in terms meaningful to application<br/>developers, that capture the most common application structures. Each<br/>archetype will be backed by a compilable specification written in a simple<br/>high-level archetype-specific language. After customization, a specification<br/>will be passed to a synthesis algorithm to produce a working hardware-software<br/>system. Synthesis of efficient wireless sensor networks would be intractable<br/>without an appropriate hardware-software platform. Therefore, this project<br/>will also determine the particular types of hardware and software components<br/>necessary to enable support for wide range of archetypes.

It is based on the premise that the use of contextual information from applications that help users to coordinate or communicate with others - such as their calendar, messaging contacts, and address books - can help in creating privacy policies for location-aware systems. In contrast to earlier work on privacy that focused on such location-independent applications as Web services, the focus in this project is primarily on privacy in location-aware systems where users carry devices that help determine their location. These include GPS-enabled cell phones, wireless PDAs, and laptops. This work will leverage a location-aware infrastructure called Whereabouts, which is deployed in the new Computer Science and Engineering building of the University of Michigan.<br/><br/>This research integrates three key concepts to simplify privacy policy specifications: (1) Privacy meta-policies: These are high-level rules that help map a user's context information. For example, a rule may make the user's location available to meeting participants near the start time of a scheduled meeting. (2) Privacy circles: These structures help users share privacy meta-policies with other users. The research will evaluate the hypothesis that privacy meta-policies will be much easier to share than low-level policy preferences that are typically available in existing privacy systems for ubiquitous computing. (3) Privacy mirrors: These are tools to help users understand the impact of their privacy meta-policies. In particular, a user can use a privacy mirror to see how a set of meta-policies would have revealed their location to other users for past events or scheduled future events.<br/><br/>The success of this work will help users coordinate and collaborate better with each other using location information, while safeguarding privacy. This is important, because location-aware computing infrastructures are starting to become widely available, but they have still not penetrated mainstream use. Better calendaring and coordination tools will also result from this research, and it will help push the frontiers on understanding how people can better manage their privacy in the context of location-aware systems.

The relation of cobordism fundamentally underlies the topology of manifolds, dating from the seminal discoveries of Pontrjagin, Thom, Fox and Milnor. The principal goal of the proposal is to deepen the recently introduced geometric and algebraic methods in the theory of knot cobordism in dimension three and to extend this theory to a wider class of topological objects including virtual knots and virtual strings. The novelty of our approach lies in a new combination of methods and techniques developed in classical knot theory and in their extension to cobordism and concordance of virtual knots and links. This should lead to a better understanding of the fundamental topological features of knots, links, 3- manifolds, and 4-manifolds. Principal Investigators anticipate a better understanding of the interplay between the fundamental groups of 3-manifolds and 4- manifolds. The proposed study should open new perspectives for applications of methods of knot theory and low-dimensional topology in other areas of mathematics and theoretical physics, including Teichmuller theory, topological quantum field theory, and combinatorial theory of words.<br/><br/>Classical knot theory attempts to understand and classify closed loops in three dimensional space. How many essential ways can circles sit in space, and how do we distinguish these mathematically? Knots model genetic structures and chemical bonds. Deformations of knots through four dimensional space encode the fundamental underpinnings of four dimensional space through the surgery theory classification tools for four manifolds.

The natural narrow bandgap materials suffer from severe nonradiative recombination and free carrier absorption. This peculiarity averts development of high performance room temperature operated longwavelength optoelectronic devices in the technologically important 2 to 5 m spectral range. The investigators plan to develop a new class of high radiative efficiency mid-infrared nanostructures based on the GaSb material system including GaSb dilute-nitrides. The participating researchers perform detailed studies of the carrier recombination dynamics, including original experimental investigation of the theoretically predicted resonant and interface assisted Auger recombination specific to nanomaterials for mid-infrared photonics. The role of hot carrier and nonequlibrium phonon effects are paid special attention. The original concept of the resonant Auger assisted population inversion is experimentally studied for the first time. The development of a novel class of mid-infrared nanostructure materials, complemented with comprehensive experimental and theoretical studies, will enhance knowledge of narrow gap nanostructure physics and can transform traditional approaches to mid-infrared photonic device design.<br/><br/>This project is a collaborative research effort between the State University of New York at Stony Brook (USA) and Saint-Petersburg State Polytechnic University (Russia). The combination of expertise at Stony Brook in design and manufacturing of mid-infrared photonic devices and the expertise of the Russian counterparts in experimental and theoretical studies of the hot carrier and recombination phenomena in narrow gap semiconductors makes the proposed material development to rely on comprehensive understanding of the underlying physics and to be oriented at real world applications. The intellectual merit includes advancing knowledge and understanding of the physical phenomena particular to low dimensional carriers and improving the understanding of Auger recombination and free carrier absorption in narrow gap nanostructures. The project may result in a significant technology addition to national security. GaSb- and InAs-based narrow band gap nanostructure materials are poised to provide the basis for room temperature operation, mid-infrared photonics.<br/><br/>This award is co-supported by the Office of International Science and Engineering.

This research has a total of four aims: (1) To determine contribution of restitution dependent effects in amplitude of period doubling bifurcation; (2) To determine if enhanced residual memory in restitution increases stability of activation; (3) To develop portable feedback based pacing control approach that can be implemented with ease in diverse electrophysiology laboratories; and (4). To use mathematical modeling to further explore causes of period doubling bifurcation and the role of restitution and memory. This study challenges an existing accepted model and could potentially make an important contribution to the field. The project is a combination of experimental and computational modeling.<br/><br/>The impact of greatest importance is the potential to make a profound contribution to the understanding of electrical activity within the heart, and down the road to improve electrical stimulation therapies such as pacemakers and other implantable or emergency use devices required after cardiac arrhythmias. The project will include students of all ages to perform the research, particularly for Aim 3 in which the Labview code will be developed. This effort, particularly for high school students and undergraduate seniors, provide important research opportunities for young students from Kentucky.

Properties of ecosystems constrain the range of possible pathways for agricultural intensification, and the nature of agricultural production can influence aspects of human societies. At the same time, human societies create and develop specific systems of agricultural production that transform ecosystems, sometimes in dramatic ways. The Hawaiian Archipelago offers excellent opportunities to explore the nature and consequences of interactions among ecosystems, agricultural systems, and human societies as they played out over centuries prior to European contact. This collaborative research project will focus on intensive agriculture and society in Kohala, Hawai'i, where broad and well-defined environmental gradients encompass a large (60 km-square) and long-sustained rain-fed dryland agricultural system that was abandoned in the mid-19th century. With participation from local communities and schools, experimental gardens will be established across the range of the field system. This effort will draw on community input (traditional knowledge), archaeological observations, and ecosystem/soil analyses in addition to agricultural experimentation. Once in place, these gardens will be used to develop physiologically based agricultural crop models and to determine how the agricultural system was organized and integrated; how it was sustained for centuries prior to European contact; and how it interacted with nearby irrigated systems. This last effort will make use of strong differences in the abundances of multiple stable isotopes across the broad environmental gradient of Kohala.<br/><br/>The establishment of experimental gardens within the boundaries of the ancient and long-abandoned Kohala field system will serve several scientific and educational objectives. A well-validated crop model for dryland crops will allow much more detailed calculations of agricultural yields; these in turn will make existing models of past agricultural production and human demography across the Kohala landscape more realistic. Similarly, isotopic measurements of Hawaiian crops will support detailed interpretations of sources of food and other goods as these varied over space, time, and the social status of households in pre-contact Hawai'i. Together these efforts will make it possible to determine how this and other large, rain-fed agricultural systems functioned and how they interacted with nearby communities based on irrigated agriculture. The project therefore will contribute to understanding the evolution of complex societies. The gardens represent an extraordinary educational resource because they will make a step toward restoring an example of the main pre-contact agricultural system on the island of Hawai'i. School and community groups will make use of these gardens to learn science by conducting field experiments in a culturally meaningful setting. This project is supported by an award resulting from the NSF competition focusing on the Dynamics of Coupled Natural and Human Systems.

However, they, suffer from serious interference problems which limit their capacity. We use TDMA scheduling to address these performance problems. We use a SINR-based physical interference modeling for realism, and various forms of diversities - such as transmit power control, directional antennas, multiple channels, and rates - to maximize performance. We also introduce a measurement-based modeling technique to make the physical interference modeling practical. We support these innovations by experimental studies. Our goal is developing a complete set of algorithms, protocols, and system solutions that target managed mesh networks. The protocol solutions include the routing layer and below, and are compatible with existing Inter-networking protocols for the transport layer and up.<br/><br/>The project's intellectual merit has the following components: (i) New protocols for TDMA scheduling with diversity and physical interference modeling, (ii) integration of scheduling with routing, (iii) measurement-based modeling of physical interference, and (iv) simulation modeling and testbed experiments to support the protocol innovations.<br/><br/>The project contributes to the education and training of graduate students in the two universities -Georgia Tech and Stony Brook University. The project gains leverage from existing international collaborations of PIs with IIT-CNR in Italy and CDAC in India, and strengthens this collaboration. Finally, success in this project means low cost, ubiquitous broadband connectivity. It competes well with WLANs and wired connectivity, and is expected to level the technological playing field.

The fact that not only humans and their food sources (domestic animals and agronomic plants), but also natural animal and plant populations are afflicted (amphibian decline), has directed attention to the important and fascinating role of parasites in ecosystems. With their rapid turn-over, parasitic populations are ideal objects to study the principles of evolution; in turn, it is important to understand these principles to control infectious diseases effectively. Mathematical models and their analysis are very much needed for a deeper understanding and as a theoretical laboratory to devise control and management strategies.<br/><br/>While the health aspects of parasite-host interactions are of immediate concern, their impact on biological diversity, in interaction with population structures, may be as important. The role of fungal and viral pathogens in the decline or even disappearance of amphibians is only one example of concern for the negative role parasites can play in species diversity, another would be parasite-mediated competitive exclusion. The following projects in mathematical modeling and model analysis are the focus of the project: (i) Stability and periodic oscillations in disease models with horizontal and vertical transmission; (ii) Parasites in stage-structured host populations; (iii) Mediated coexistence and extinction in prey-predator-parasite systems; (iv) Size-structured models for in-host prion proliferation.<br/><br/>Studying these mathematical host-parasite models will greatly contribute to the understanding of the role of parasites and population structure as well as their interaction in the maintenance of biological diversity. It will enhance our insight in the interplay of the possible multitude of factors which cause species decline and disappearance. These models will help to design environmental management strategies that foster or at least are compatible with species preservation. They can be used as educational tools in graduate and undergraduate instruction and for effective communication with the scientific community, public health officers, and an educated public audience.

Consequently, populations consuming water sources where these metal-reducing bacteria are active may be at increased risk for developing cancer and skin lesions due to elevated levels of arsenic. This research will develop a molecular-mechanistic understanding of arsenate respiratory reduction, which is a major biological process thought to promote arsenic mobilization. The goal of the project is to determine how CymA interacts with other redox components predicted to occur in the anaerobic electron transport chain of arsenate-reducing Shewanella species. The specific aims are to: (1) test the hypothesis that CymA exhibits menaquinol binding activity and (2) test the hypothesis that CymA interacts with the arsenate respiratory reductase, ArrAB. Menaquinol binding of CymA will be determined using menaquinol analogs that can be monitor by their spectroscopic properties. In vivo protein-protein interactions of CymA with ArrAB will be investigated using frequency resonance energy transfer (FRET) methods and CymA and ArrAB proteins fused with fluorescent proteins known to exhibit FRET signals. Results from this study will have direct applications to understanding similar interactions with downstream pathways for nitrate, fumarate, and iron oxide metabolisms. This research will provide new insight into environmental investigations of the underlying mechanism of microbial-mediated mobilization of arsenic. The broader impacts of the work will include promoting the education of undergraduate and graduate students. Students will receive hands-on training in anaerobic microbiology, preparation of media, and methods for analyzing the end products of respiration.

Meissner	07/31/2011	$117,186.00		dickinsonj@mail.montclair.edu	1 Normal Avenue	Montclair	NJ	070431624	9736556923	SBE	1372	OTHR, 0000	$0.00	Abstract<br/>Collaborative Research: The Impact of Cuing on Children's Eyewitness<br/>Testimony and Source Monitoring<br/><br/> Each year, child protection workers, police officers, and staff members at child advocacy centers interview tens of thousands of children who are believed to be victims or witnesses of crimes. Because sexual abuse cases are especially difficult to investigate, efforts to develop interviewing techniques for child witnesses have focused on procedures for eliciting accurate information about inappropriate sexual contact. Currently, two forensic interviewing procedures dominate public policy: One emphasizes techniques for transferring control of the conversation to children and eliciting information with free-recall prompts, whereas the other cues children to report abuse experiences with body drawings and direct (specific) questions about touching. Protocols that emphasize free recall are often viewed as pro-defense (because these guidelines help prevent false allegations by discouraging questions containing specific event details), whereas protocols that emphasize interviewing aids and specific questions are viewed as pro-prosecution (because many professionals believe these procedures help children disclose abuse).<br/> The current controversy about how to interview children stems mainly from a widespread but untested belief that conversational techniques that minimize false reports also reduce disclosures of embarrassing events. Supporting this belief is the well-known finding that encouraging children to describe events in their own words results in fewer false reports than cuing children with direct questions, but that a series of direct questions elicits more detailed narratives. However, previous studies that found benefits from cuing children's memories generally asked children to describe events that were known to have occurred, the topic of discussion was identified, and interviewers presented memory cues after children had already described events in their own words. These studies do not, however, tell us whether cuing early in an interview results in more accurate or complete testimony when the veracity of allegations is unknown or when children may have been exposed to misinformation about what actually happened. In fact, two well-researched phenomena-retrieval-induced forgetting and encoding specificity-demonstrate that cues often suppress memory for contextual information and decrease the number of items recalled. For example, adults in a pilot study who viewed photographs to help them recall sentences recalled fewer sentences than adults who simply recalled the sentences did, and these adults also were less likely to recall which of two individuals had provided the sentences.<br/> The current project consists of two studies that will determine how cuing descriptions of experienced events with line drawings and specific questions influences the quality of information provided by children who are 4 to 9 years of age. Study 1 will explore the practical significance of cuing with a well-researched paradigm in which children experience an engaging event, are exposed to false information about that event, and receive interviews that mimic the two major styles. Study 2 is a basic memory study that will maximize the ability to detect developmental changes in the impact of cuing. Both studies will measure the effects of cuing on memory for events and source information, which is information about where children initially learned the information. Results will contribute to understanding basic memory mechanisms by documenting how cuing influences children's recall, guide future research on eyewitness testimony by illuminating the strengths and limitations of two interviewing styles, and impact state- and national-level training for professionals who investigate crimes against children and other vulnerable groups.

Because plants require pollen for seed production, many plant species have adapted to a lack of pollinators by self-pollinating, thus enabling them to produce seeds even in the absence of pollinators. Self-pollination, however, erodes genetic variation, the raw material for adaptation. This study examines whether self-pollination constrains the ability of plants to adapt to other important environmental challenges. Wild monkey flowers (Mimulus guttatus) will be divided into self-pollinating and cross-pollinating lines and their ability to adapt to one of the most serious threats that plants face - insect herbivores - will be tested.<br/><br/>This collaboration unites expertise in plant mating system biology and plant-pest interactions. This study is highly relevant to conservation biology which needs to understand how reduced genetic variation affects adaptation. Because many of the most important crops are self-pollinating (e.g., wheat and rice) and are constantly bombarded by pests, this study has important applied implications. This proposal will support a postdoctoral fellow, a research assistant, and four undergraduate students. Supplemental funding will be sought to train additional undergraduates and K-12 teachers.

Persistent features include the subdued secular variation in the Pacific relative to the Atlantic hemisphere, and regions of concentrated geomagnetic flux over Canada and Siberia at ~60∞ N latitude. Transient historical features include movement of the North Magnetic Pole and a growing region of reversed magnetic flux at the core/mantle boundary below the South Atlantic. Along with the present dipole intensity decay rate of 5% per century (five times the free decay rate), these observations have led some researchers to speculate that the geomagnetic field may be heading toward a reversal or an excursion. The question of whether the recently accelerated dipole decay is likely to continue is important to society because the magnetic field shields the earth from cosmic ray bombardment, with practical implications for telecommunications, human health, and global ecosystems. A recent proposition that the present rate of dipole decay is driven by the South Atlantic anomaly and is only a few hundred years old suggests that long-term changes could result from a series of transient centennial scale features, which are difficult to resolve in the short historical record. Understanding the interplay between transient and persistent geomagnetic features over longer time intervals in the paleomagnetic record is, therefore, likely to play a significant role in deciphering the dynamics of the geodynamo, as well as having implications for mechanisms of long-term production of cosmogenic isotopes in the atmosphere, which have been used to infer solar variability and its impact on past climate changes. <br/><br/>Recent paleomagnetic observations are now beginning to document transient features as abrupt sub-millennial and even sub-centennial paleomagnetic field behaviors. Paleomagnetic secular variation (PSV) records that record abrupt features are so-far limited to the Atlantic hemisphere (eastern North America, Iceland/Greenland, Europe/Middle East). Whether this reflects asymmetry of the field or a lack of available data is presently unclear. This project will test the spatial scale of abrupt geomagnetic behavior and beginning to assess PSV of the Pacific, while providing high quality data for the next generation of spherical harmonic models, through a detailed study of sediments from the Southeast Alaska continental margin. This opportunity arises because of recently collected new jumbo piston cores of extraordinarily high sedimentation rate (meters to 10's of meters per thousand years) with favorable magnetic properties, on cruse EW0408 of R/V Ewing. Paleomagnetic secular variation will be studied on eight out of 27 available jumbo piston cores using u-channel and discrete sample methods. Biogenic components suitable for radiocarbon dating are present, although severely diluted by the terrigenous sediment. Detailed chronologies based on radiocarbon will be developed using new techniques of precise accelerator 14C dating of ultra-small samples, developed at the Keck AMS Laboratory at UC Irvine. This study will, therefore, fill a significant data gap, test hypotheses on magnetic field variability and employing new methods for both high-resolution paleomagnetic measurements and fine-scale chronologic constraints that will substantially advance understanding of the dynamics of Earth's magnetic field. The data generated will contribute to differentiating the timescales of geomagnetic versus solar control on terrestrial cosmic ray flux and cosmogenic isotope production. This is significant for understanding both climatic and solar variability, and important to society because the magnetic field shields the earth from cosmic ray bombardment, with practical implications for telecommunications, human health, and global ecosystems. Regional PSV and relative paleointensity master curves will be developed and used as stratigraphic templates for a variety of marine and terrestrial paleoclimatic studies. Data will be contributed to databases and used to supplement ongoing spherical harmonic studies of the field from a region with little data. Radiocarbon results will contribute to understanding of changing reservoir ages in the North Pacific region, of interest to improving chronologies of past climate changes, and to understanding variations in the oceans carbon cycle. This project will support the training of both undergraduate honors students and graduate students.

Various massively networked systems are being designed to manage this information. Such systems typically contain two key architectural components: a software network connecting the participating nodes in the system, and a query engine running across the nodes. There is little consensus on how to co-engineer these components to achieve an efficient, robust solution. However, recent work on Declarative Networking showed that both these layers can be naturally implemented in a high-level language, in which the programmer specifies what result is desired, not how it is to be achieved.<br/><br/>This project develops Dynamic Metacompilation to enable automatic co-optimization of the network and query components of such systems. In this framework, the optimizing compiler for a networked information system is bootstrapped from optimization rules written in the very same declarative, distributed language that is being optimized. Such a scheme will bring remarkable ease of software engineering for this new class of systems.<br/><br/>The results of the work can significantly accelerate the development of a new generation of systems to harness the potential of a massively networked and data-rich world, with implications for a broad range of applications including environmental monitoring, public health, disaster response, and computer system management. Project funds support the training and research of two graduate students, and plans are underway for use of the software in coursework. Publications, technical reports, software and experimental data from this research will be disseminated via the project web site (http:// p2.cs.berkeley.edu).

These plants are best known as the source of tropical passionfruit, but are also widely cultivated for their beautiful, complex flowers. Passionflowers appear to be a recently-evolved lineage that has experienced rapid species diversification. Many species are poorly understood with regard to morphology, geographical distribution, and conservation status, especially in the largest lineage of passionflowers, subgenus Decaloba, with 235+ species. This study will synthesize modern and traditional approaches to address these problems, using DNA sequence data, scanning electron microscopy, and observation of fresh and preserved specimens. Field work will enable collection of fresh material and documentation of species distributions. This project will yield a revision of all species in Decaloba, and will provide a modern evolutionary framework within which to address questions about the evolution of floral shape, pollination syndromes, floral development, and the biogeographical history of the lineage.<br/><br/>This study will address important biological and evolutionary questions in an especially charismatic group of plants. Undergraduate and graduate students will participate in the research. Undergraduates at Keene State College and Harris-Stowe State University, institutions that primarily enroll underrepresented groups in the sciences, will especially benefit from involvement in this study. Summer workshops at Rancho Santa Ana Botanic Garden will involve students from the local community.

This work is motivated by issues associated with the insertion of stents to structurally reinforce arteries treated by angioplasty in patients with stenoses (blockages) resulting from the progressive, degenerative cardiovascular disease atherosclerosis. Heart disease is the number one killer of men and women in the US and developed countries world-wide. Medical procedures performed in the US to treat atherosclerosis cost tens of billions of dollars annually. A simplified model with the relevant features of a stent in a curved vessel will be constructed and probed with non-invasive optical velocimetry techniques including LDV and PIV. It is hypothesized that the orientation and position of the stent relative to the walls will affect the secondary flows in the curved vessels, which will impact cellular biochemical signaling that is responsible for vascular remodeling.<br/>The intellectual merit of the proposed study is to develop an understanding of the sensitivity/receptivity of viscous layers leading to pulsatile secondary flows in curved pipes (representative of curved arteries which are ubiquitous in the body). The forcing functions to be employed are based on physiologically relevant waveforms that are considerably more complex than simple sinusoidal forcing previously used in the relatively few studies of pulsatile flow in curved pipes. The rapid accelerations and decelerations of the flow, which are characteristics of blood pumped by the heart during systole and diastole, produce a richness of flow physics. In terms of broader applicability to fluid dynamics, such perturbations may be considered as passive flow control in curved pipes.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of the proposed study include societal, educational, and technological components. The underlying societal motivation is combating heart disease. Not only is the price high in terms of mobidity and mortality, but the economic impact of necessary medical procedures is tremendous. Another societal broader impact of this program will be to promote participation of students from underrepresented groups. Because of its urban setting in Brooklyn, Polytechnic University has many programs in place to attract underrepresented groups. For example, Polytechnic''s PROMISE FUND has given disadvantaged high school students the opportunity to attend work with faculty on research projects during the summer. The PI is actively involved to engage Polytechnic University as a partner in the NSF-funded Central New York-Puerto Rico Alliance for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (AGEP) project intended to significantly increase the number of domestic students receiving doctoral degrees in the sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), with special emphasis on underrepresented groups. <br/><br/>Co-funded by the Biomedical Engineering, Particulate and Multiphase processes, and Thermal Transport Processes Programs.

A key additional requirement for real-time embedded systems is predictable timing behavior of software components, which requires that bounds on the worst-case execution time (WCET) of embedded software be determined. While static timing analysis yields verifiable bounds on the WCET, it cannot keep pace with architectural innovations and hardware performance variation due to chip fabrication scaling. <br/><br/>This work contributes a fundamentally new approach to bounding the WCET with three major contributions: (1) Instead of simulating execution, actual execution in hardware is promoted to assess the WCET of a task. This approach not only renders tedious hardware modeling unnecessary but also confirms correct behavior regardless of architectural complexity or hardware variation. (2) The approach and its complexity are evaluated by FPGA synthesis. This assesses the feasibility of the design and validates a prototype implementation. (3) The impact of advanced architectural features is studied in a co-design space exploration, aimed to provide predictability and tight WCET bounds. The research conducted in this project advances existing science and technology through novel techniques in hardware and software design for safety-critical embedded real-time systems by providing high-confidence bounds on execution times; enhancing hardware architectures with support to assess execution times; and customizing hardware features via co-design to improve predictability. These capabilities directly benefit safety and reliability of software controlling, for example, aircraft and components of cars, thereby aiding the high-confidence design of embedded systems.

Craniofacial variation has important implications for diet, defense, posture, balance, hearing, vision, and the accommodation of the expanding primate brain. The skull is a complex adaptive structure, and the question naturally arises pertaining to the genetic mechanisms that assemble and coordinate its shape. This project will determine whether variation in head shape occurs along similar anatomical axes among living monkeys and apes, their fossil ancestors, a pedigree of 800 extant baboons, and in laboratory mice. Computerized tomography (CT) scans will be acquired from these heads and used to measure variation in three dimensions. The genes responsible for this variation will be identified using data from baboon and mouse. Developmental pathways are shared among mammals, so mice provide an important comparative and experimental basis for primate findings. The manner by which genes structure variation in head shape will be investigated by combined comparative DNA sequence and bioinformatic analysis, and by engineering similar changes in mice to those seen in baboons. Many genes doubtlessly contribute to structures like the head, and a general challenge to modern evolutionary and developmental genetics generally is to understand whether some genes are repeatedly involved in similar changes in complex traits over the millions of years and different branches of evolution, or whether different genes in the shared developmental pathways are responsible in each instance.<br/><br/>The project will generate a large amount of data which will be posted on a publicly accessible website along with information on analytical approaches and results. The PIs have a strong record of training women and minority students and they will continue this tradition at all levels from undergraduate to postdoctoral. Human evolutionary studies have a strong public appeal and this project will be exceptionally popular to the public media.

This limits basic understanding of the temporal and spatial patterns of glacier dynamics and the sensitivity of glaciers to climate variability across the Himalayas. This doctoral dissertation research project will combine data from the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) sensor with GIS and field techniques to derive mass-balance measurements and glacial mapping over large areas of the Himalayas using a multi-scale approach. The doctoral candidate's specific objectives are (1) to develop and field validate remote sensing methods for estimating glacier parameters (area, length, mass balance, and equilibrium-line altitude) at the basin scale; (2) to construct a geospatial glacier inventory for analysis of glacier changes at the regional scale; and (3) to understand spatial patterns of glacier fluctuations in relation to climatic variability at the mountain-range scale. Field measurements conducted at the same time with the image acquisition will be the focus of this study. Specific tasks to be accomplished in the field are (1) obtaining ground control points (GCPs) needed for orthorectification of ASTER scenes for the entire Himalaya; (2) validating algorithms for mapping of debris-covered glaciers; and (3) validating remote sensing mass-balance estimates with field measurements at various sites. Field verification will be conducted at Chhota Shigri glacier in the Lahaul-Spiti region of western India, and Glacier AX010 in Solu-Khumbu, Nepal. These activities should enable the student to develop methods that will be applied to unsurveyed sites throughout the Himalayas, with an emphasis on Sikkim.<br/><br/>This project will result in a systematic, comprehensive assessment of glacier parameters across the Himalayas, which will serve to provide a more complete picture of the current state of glaciers worldwide. The results of this study will provide regional and local planners with valuable information to develop strategies for water management, planning of hydroelectric stations, and detection and management of glacier-related hazards like glacial-lake outburst floods, ice avalanches, and debris flows. The Himalayan glacier datasets will be made available to the broader scientific community in a timely manner by means of the GLIMS Glacier Database, which is stored at the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder. This project will facilitate interactions with remote sensing laboratories and universities in India and Nepal. It will provide graduate students from Kathmandu University with training and assistance in GIS and remote sensing methods as well as with first-hand field experience. As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career. This award is jointly funded by NSF's Office of International Science and Engineering.

This project integrates experimental and longitudinal approaches to examine cultural and individual mechanisms underlying autobiographical memory development in middle childhood. This age period, while generally neglected in the field of memory research, is critical for the development of advanced autobiographical memory skills for detailed, well-structured, and accurate remembering. Children and their mothers from European American families, Chinese families in China, and first-generation Chinese immigrant families in the U.S. will participate. Three home interviews will be arranged for each child between 6 and 8 years of age, where children's developing autobiographical memory will be assessed in relation to their narrative skills, self-concept, metamemory, temporal concepts, and cultural knowledge. Mothers' cultural beliefs will be assessed through surveys. A staged event will be conducted at the first interview and children's memory of the event will be assessed for content, amount, and accuracy at later time points. To delineate the contribution of parental reminiscing behavior to children's memory, experimentally planned mother-child reminiscing will take place between the first two interviews, with mothers in the experimental group being trained to share memories with their children in an elaborative style.<br/><br/>The project will make a unique contribution to current theories by examining both individual and cultural parameters on memory development. It will further provide new insights into the multi-faceted processes and outcomes of children's developing autobiographical memory skills, and fill in the theoretical and empirical gap concerning autobiographical memory development in middle childhood. Because autobiographical memory is constructed through the child's knowledge of the world and of the self and the memory, in turn, constitutes the child's identity, personality, and psychological well-being, the findings will have the potential to inform research and clinical practices regarding issues that emerge during middle childhood, such as eating disorders and depression. Furthermore, situated in a cross-cultural context, the findings will inform parenting, educational practices, and real life settings in contemporary American society where there are an increasing number of immigrant populations, as well as in the current global context that calls for intercultural exchanges and understanding.

Flynn of Columbia University and his postdoctoral fellows and graduate and undergraduate student colleagues will use scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) to study: two-dimensional self-assembly at surfaces, the electronic and chemical properties of two-dimensional carbon (graphene) sheets and the chemistry taking place at environmentally important iron oxide surfaces. <br/><br/>In this wide-reaching program, Prof. Flynn and his colleagues will use scanning tunneling methods -- both microscopy and spectroscopy -- to examine the molecular level details of a variety of systems. They will examine how molecules self-assemble into patterns on surfaces -- the ability to understand the mechanisms of this behavior will help others learn how to design and assemble molecular-level devices. They will examine how organic pollutants degrade on the surface of iron oxide surfaces, in order to develop better strategies for understanding and remediating the effects of subsurface soil pollution. Finally, studies of the fascinating material graphene will be conducted to begin to learn about this nanoscopic carbon material''s chemical and physical properties. Besides the possible societal benefits accruing from the research supported in this award, Prof. Flynn will continue with his many outreach and service activities.

In conjunction with an iterative decoding algorithm based on passing probability estimates along the edges of a graph naturally associated to the code, these codes show great promise for current and future communication systems. The analysis consists of an analysis of the associated code graphs, fundamental cones (with implications in linear programming decoding and iterative decoding), pseudo-codeword sets (the culprits that prevent the convergence of iterative decoding) and pseudo-weights (a measure of performance under iterative decoding). The goals are: to develop a theory of finite-length LDPC codes and provide a comparison between different codes having related algebraic structures; to unify relevant notions like near-codewords, pseudo-codewords, girth, minimum distance, minimum pseudo-weight by studying the effect that each has on the others; to derive lower and upper bounds on the performance of LDPC block and convolutional codes based on these parameters and their influences; and to ultimately provide guidelines for designing finite-length LDPC codes that have predictably good performance under iterative decoding.<br/><br/>The inclusion of LDPC block codes in emerging standards such as digital video broadcasting, Ethernet and third-generation (3G) mobile-telephone networks, which will allow wireless access from 3G phones to be over ten times faster than from an old-fashioned dial-up, has recently spurred interest in LDPC convolutional codes. Initial research on LDPC convolutional codes leads the PI to the belief that these codes have several potential practical advantages compared to LDPC block codes. The goal of this project is to analyze these codes and construct new ones with predictably good performance. This research will naturally integrate abstract theory and real-world applications, providing exciting opportunities for cross-cutting research. The PI's continuing collaboration with leading engineering experts from academia and industry enables a transition from the theoretical research findings in this project to practical communication systems. It is anticipated that the project will have an impact on the future information infrastructure and contribute to universal accessibility. This impact will extend to the areas of data compression and communication protocols and security, since their underlying theories are closely related to coding theory.

Determining the detailed composition and structure of DOM offers unparalleled rewards as their informational richness represents a unique set of biogeochemical tracers capable of providing important insights into the origins of their parent waters and the diagenetic alterations that have occurred within those waters during transport.  Recent analytical breakthroughs have the potential to bring a major fraction of marine DOM within our analytical window, thus greatly facilitating the reading of DOM's molecular messages.  In addition, there has been promising improvement in the ability to isolate DOM using reverse osmosis coupled with electrodialysis (RO/ED) that can now isolate up to 95% of marine DOM compared to ~10-40% for previous techniques. <br/><br/>In this research, a new investigator from Old Dominion University will lead a team that also includes Georgia Institute of Technology that will combine improved isolation of marine DOM with the unparalleled power of ultra-high resolution FT-ICR MS and advanced NMR spectroscopy to gain major new insights into the composition of marine DOM and the biogeochemical processes controlling its composition. The main goals of this proposed study are to: (1) characterize bio-refractory DOM that dominates the marine DOM pool especially in the deep sea; (2) characterize newly produced DOM in an upwelling region and the semi-biolabile and photobleached DOM that accumulates in oligotrophic, subtropical gyre surface waters; and (3) compare RO/ED isolated DOM to the original sample and to DOM isolated using ultrafiltration and solid-phase extraction (e.g., XAD and C18). <br/><br/>In terms of broader impacts, this research will lay the foundations for future oceanic and global biogeochemical studies where these advanced techniques can be used to trace compounds or component classes of DOM from their multifarious sources, along their various paths of diagenesis and transport, to their points of export, microbial uptake or mineralization. In addition, the PIs will provide critically needed precursory reference material for the marine biogeochemical community. The proposed study will support a new Assistant Research Professor at ODU and three doctoral students. Collaborative ties with investigators from WHOI, MIT and the HOT site will foster cooperative field-based research. Public outreach and information dissemination will be facilitated by creation of a dedicated project website and through public and news media interactions, as appropriate.<br/>
0717558	Doctoral Dissertation Research in Political Science: American Public Opinion and the Politics of Immigration	SES	POLITICAL SCIENCE	08/01/2007	08/19/2008	Paula McClain	NC	Duke University	Standard Grant	Brian D. Humes	07/31/2009	$11,933.00		pmcclain@duke.edu	2200 W. Main St, Suite 710	Durham	NC	277054010	9196843030	SBE	1371	9179, SMET	$0.00	This project investigates how attitudes toward Latino immigrants color American support for immigration policies. More than once, public misgivings about foreigners have been expressed through support for exclusionary immigration policies (e.g., Higham 1955; King 2000). Political scientists concur that Americans are generally predisposed against immigration, yet it remains unclear whether one or all immigrant groups activate this stance (e.g., Harwood 1986; Simon and Alexander 1993; Citrin et al. 1997). Though history records numerous outbursts of opposition to Irish, Chinese, German, and Italian newcomers (e.g., Shankman 1982; Takaki 1989; Ignatiev 1995; King 2005), we lack a systematic understanding of the degree to which attitudes toward one immigrant group shape public opposition to immigration. Using two original survey-experiments which incorporate an Implicit Association Test (IAT), this project endeavors to demonstrate how Americans'' evaluations of immigration policies are subtly-but indelibly-influenced by anti-Latino attitudes.<br/> A growing volume of polling data on immigration reveals two things: sizeable opposition to immigration and solid support for stronger measures to curb it (Gallup 2000; Lapinski et al. 1997). Yet what these polls do not reveal-and in fact, cannot fully reveal-is the extent to which support for immigration policies is influenced by misgivings about particular immigrants. That is because surveys generally query respondents about these policies without identifying immigrants by ethnicity. And, when group-specific questions are asked, the validity of responses is threatened by strong social norms against the expression of negative attitudes toward ethnic and racial groups (Mendelberg 2001; Banaji et al.1995). <br/> To overcome these challenges, this project employs two survey-experiments which incorporate an Implicit Association Test (IAT) designed to capture negative implicit attitudes toward Latino immigrants. In these experiments, all subjects complete standard self-reports of attitudes toward various immigrant groups, as well as evaluations of policy proposals addressing illegal and legal immigration. During these evaluations, subjects are asked about these policy proposals with reference to either Latino immigrants or non-Latino immigrants. This design aims to demonstrate two things. First, in lieu of implicit attitude measures, Americans should display a markedly even-handed evaluation of immigrants and immigration policies. For instance, it is expected that subjects will support stronger measures to curb immigration regardless of the ethnicity and legal status of foreigners. Yet when implicit attitude measures are introduced, it is anticipated that anti-Latino attitudes will be stamped onto evaluations of these policy proposals, even when they make no reference to Latinos. <br/> The findings from this research have implications both for society in general and the social science community in particular. By documenting how implicit anti-Latino attitudes mold individuals'' preferences for immigration policy, this study systematically challenges the view that opposition to immigration has nothing to do with the ethnicity of immigrants. To the contrary, the evidence from this investigation will suggest that implicit anti-Latino attitudes are activated by merely broaching the issue of immigration, as occurs through public opinion polls. In this way, these findings will raise questions about the validity of standard survey items on immigration by diagnosing how far these questions capture implicit anti-Latino attitudes in addition to policy preferences. Equally important, the evidence will suggest revisions to standard models of survey response to account for an important omitted variable, namely, the influence of implicit attitudes on survey items.

Alkanes are also the principal constituents of commercial lubricants. A microscopic understanding of the structural and dynamical properties of alkane films could potentially lead to technological advances ranging from more durable polymer coatings to lubricants that reduce wear in automobile engines and in nanoscale devices such as computer hard drives. This project will utilize high-resolution scattering of neutrons and computer simulations as the principal techniques to determine the rates at which flexible alkane molecules change their shape and how these conformational changes affect the molecules' ability to stick to a solid surface. Experiments will be conducted on state-of-the-art neutron spectrometers at the Center for Neutron Research at the National Institute of Standards and Technology and at the newly constructed Spallation Neutron Source at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The project includes structural studies utilizing Atomic Force Microscopy, synchrotron x-ray scattering at Argonne National Laboratory, and neutron diffraction at the University of Missouri Research Reactor.

Alkanes are also the principal constituents of commercial lubricants. A fundamental issue concerned with films of intermediate-length alkane molecules (15 < n < 50) is the effect that changes in molecular shape (conformation) induced by heating may have on binding of molecules to a solid surface and, at a macroscopic level, the wetting of the fluid film to a surface. These conformational changes are important for understanding such technologically important phenomena as the evaporation of thin lubricant films from the surfaces of magnetic storage disks, the desorption of alkanes from catalytic surfaces, and the lubricating characteristics of alkane films. This project will utilize quasielastic neutron scattering and molecular dynamics simulations as the principal techniques to investigate the molecular conformational changes that occur over a range of time scales (picoseconds to nanoseconds) in alkane films adsorbed on solid surfaces. Experiments will be conducted on state-of-the-art neutron spectrometers at the Center for Neutron Research at the National Institute of Standards and Technology and at the newly constructed Spallation Neutron Source at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Since interpretation of the dynamical experiments requires knowledge of the film structure, the project includes structural studies utilizing Atomic Force Microscopy, synchrotron x-ray scattering at Argonne National Laboratory, and neutron diffraction at the University of Missouri Research Reactor. This research will provide training of undergraduate and graduate students in fundamental aspects of polymer science, preparing them for careers in industry and academia as well as at our expanding national facilities for neutron and x-ray scattering.

Accordingly, this modeling study will address the impact of these major processes on pore pressures and fluid flow within the prism, mega-splay fault, and plate boundary fault. The modeling will be implemented using an existing software package ABAQUS. This package offers the ability to simulate the major features important to this modeling, will allow modeling results to be reproducible by other researchers, and is flexible enough to accommodate needs of future subduction zone modeling. <br/>The model will be applied to the Kii transect of the Nankai subduction zone and used to test the following interrelated hypotheses: <br/>Hypothesis 1: The mega-splay fault system significantly alters the patterns of excess pore pressures and porosity loss within the accretionary complex. <br/>Hypothesis 2: The hydrologic role of the Nankai mega-splay system can be illuminated through observation of pore pressures, porosities, and fluid chemistry. <br/>Hypothesis 3: Underplating rejuvenates fluid expulsion at the base of the accretionary prism by transferring sediments to a different stress state and by moving the decollement zone to a less dewatered area. <br/>Although this application of the modeling is to the Kii transect of the Nankai subduction complex, an assessment of the importance of underplating and out-of-sequence thrusting for subduction zone dewatering and deformation will be useful for other subduction zones, as well as for workers in fold and thrust belts. Splay faulting and underplating are commonly inferred features that could greatly alter pore pressure and porosity distributions (and thus seismogenesis) in many subduction zones. <br/><br/>Broader Impact <br/>Understanding seismogenic zone processes has great societal impact related to earthquake and tsunami hazards. This study will constitute an initial step in the long-term investigation of the seismogenic zone. Modeling conducted early in the investigative process can help to shape scientific strategies during drilling and monitoring. The use of the ABAQUS software package will expand the ability of the subduction zone modeling community. Model input data sets will be made available to other researchers. As an active proponent in NanTroSEIZE, Liz Screaton will directly communicate modeling results to fellow proponents and at future workshops and NanTroSEIZE-related meetings. In addition, general interest conclusions will be published in scientific journals and presented at national scientific meetings. This project will result in the training of graduate students. At University of Florida, it will be adapted to either one PhD or two M.S. students. At University of Colorado, the project work will involve a student (either MS or PhD) in the modeling. The graduate students will present at scientific meetings and the project will be a significant component of their dissertation or thesis.

0718889	Collaborative Research: The Impact of Cuing on Children's Eyewitness Testimony and Source Monitoring	SES	LAW AND SOCIAL SCIENCES	08/01/2007	08/08/2007	Debra Poole	MI	Central Michigan University	Standard Grant	Christian A. Meissner	07/31/2010	$87,044.00		poole1da@cmich.edu	Office of Research & Graduate St	Mount Pleasant	MI	488590001	9897746777	SBE	1372	0000, OTHR	$0.00	Abstract<br/>Collaborative Research: The Impact of Cuing on Children's Eyewitness<br/>Testimony and Source Monitoring<br/><br/> Each year, child protection workers, police officers, and staff members at child advocacy centers interview tens of thousands of children who are believed to be victims or witnesses of crimes. Because sexual abuse cases are especially difficult to investigate, efforts to develop interviewing techniques for child witnesses have focused on procedures for eliciting accurate information about inappropriate sexual contact. Currently, two forensic interviewing procedures dominate public policy: One emphasizes techniques for transferring control of the conversation to children and eliciting information with free-recall prompts, whereas the other cues children to report abuse experiences with body drawings and direct (specific) questions about touching. Protocols that emphasize free recall are often viewed as pro-defense (because these guidelines help prevent false allegations by discouraging questions containing specific event details), whereas protocols that emphasize interviewing aids and specific questions are viewed as pro-prosecution (because many professionals believe these procedures help children disclose abuse).<br/> The current controversy about how to interview children stems mainly from a widespread but untested belief that conversational techniques that minimize false reports also reduce disclosures of embarrassing events. Supporting this belief is the well-known finding that encouraging children to describe events in their own words results in fewer false reports than cuing children with direct questions, but that a series of direct questions elicits more detailed narratives. However, previous studies that found benefits from cuing children's memories generally asked children to describe events that were known to have occurred, the topic of discussion was identified, and interviewers presented memory cues after children had already described events in their own words. These studies do not, however, tell us whether cuing early in an interview results in more accurate or complete testimony when the veracity of allegations is unknown or when children may have been exposed to misinformation about what actually happened. In fact, two well-researched phenomena-retrieval-induced forgetting and encoding specificity-demonstrate that cues often suppress memory for contextual information and decrease the number of items recalled. For example, adults in a pilot study who viewed photographs to help them recall sentences recalled fewer sentences than adults who simply recalled the sentences did, and these adults also were less likely to recall which of two individuals had provided the sentences.<br/> The current project consists of two studies that will determine how cuing descriptions of experienced events with line drawings and specific questions influences the quality of information provided by children who are 4 to 9 years of age. Study 1 will explore the practical significance of cuing with a well-researched paradigm in which children experience an engaging event, are exposed to false information about that event, and receive interviews that mimic the two major styles. Study 2 is a basic memory study that will maximize the ability to detect developmental changes in the impact of cuing. Both studies will measure the effects of cuing on memory for events and source information, which is information about where children initially learned the information. Results will contribute to understanding basic memory mechanisms by documenting how cuing influences children's recall, guide future research on eyewitness testimony by illuminating the strengths and limitations of two interviewing styles, and impact state- and national-level training for professionals who investigate crimes against children and other vulnerable groups.

DebRoy, Materials Science and Engineering Department, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania in collaboration with Dr. Abdel-Moneim El-Batahgy, Central Metallurgical Research & Development Institute, Helwan, Egypt. They plan to study the welding of titanium alloys. The PIs plan a collaborative experimental and theoretical investigation to advance fundamental understanding of both the complex welding processes and welded materials. Development of the grain structure and microstructure during welding of Ti-6Al-4V alloy will be investigated. In particular, temperature and velocity fields, cooling rates and solidification parameters during laser beam welding will be calculated through numerical solution of the equations of conservation of mass, momentum and energy in three dimensions. The computed temperature fields will be combined with an available Monte Carlo grain growth calculation program to understand the evolution of the grain structure and topology in the heat affected zone of Ti-6Al-4V welds for both conduction and keyhole mode laser beam welding. In addition, the microstructure in the heat affected zone of both laser beam and GTA welded Ti-6Al-4V alloys will be examined based on the computed temperature fields and the independent phase transformation kinetic data available in the literature. The weldments will be characterized extensively by the Egyptian team. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The goal of the proposed work is to obtain deeper insight into the changes that the microstructure of titanium alloys undergoes during welding. This is an important problem; it is of fundamental scientific interest as well as potential economic and technological relevance. The material being considered is an excellent example with varied applications and is an excellent choice. The objective of being able to predict the weld microstructures is noteworthy and the results from the proposed work will be of value to many disciplines. The models developed by the PI are first rate and are suitable for the problem at hand. <br/><br/>Broader impacts: Deeper insights into the effect of welding on the microstructure of titanium alloys may lead to economical benefits and progress in titanium technology. The results many be included in a graduate course on computational materials science. Integrating research in teaching, and providing rigorous training for undergraduate and graduate students at Penn State and in Egypt are likely outcomes. The PI''s department at Penn State aggressively promotes educational opportunity to women and minority students and scholars. Advances in welding technology are crucial for infrastructure and standard of living. The results will contribute to the transformation of welding to a well-accepted mainstream engineering science. Finally the results will also be of interest to many industries that has interaction with Penn State through existing outreach programs at Penn State. This project is being supported under the US-Egypt Joint Fund Program, which provides grants to scientists and engineers in both countries to carry out these cooperative activities.

Underwater acoustic sensor networks (UWA-SNs) are envisioned to enable applications for environmental monitoring of physical and chemical/biological indicators, tactical surveillance, disaster prevention, undersea exploration, and assisted navigation, etc. The major tasks under exploration include UWA-SN self-organization and deployment, self-reconfiguring (MAC, physical layer, and cross-layer design), and mission-aware waveform design/diversity with applications to target recognition, target tracking, and event detection. The AMUSE project is motivated by and targets to solve the following challenges: 1) the sensors in UWA-SN are expensive and mobile, therefore sound self-organization and self-deployment algorithms are needed; 2) waveform design and diversity for UWA-SNs with active sonars are still in its infancy; 3) the transmit and receive data rates are highly asymmetric, which requires new MAC layer design; 4) the underwater channel is impaired by fading, multipath, and doppler shift; 5) the GPS receivers do not work properly in underwater, thus new localization/navigation algorithms are required.<br/><br/>The success of the AMUSE project is able to benefit the two areas of urgent national interests: (1) Instrumentation for monitoring/prediction of natural ocean disasters including storm surges, hurricanes, tsunami, etc. (2) Harbor environments and security. In addition, this project can serve as a vehicle to promote cross-disciplinary graduate and undergraduate research and education, and to encourage the participation of under-represented and female students.

Conventional macroeconomics uses mathematics to represent how aggregate economic variables, like overall savings and investment, jointly determine one another. Such models are highly aggregate, as if the overall economy consisted of one large firm selling to a single consumer who is also an employee. Due to recent advances in computer technology, the macroeconomy can be represented much more realistically, with all the heterogeneity that is present in the real world also present in models of it.<br/><br/>In the proposed research, computational models will be built consisting of large numbers (millions) of software objects known as agents, with each object representing a person. Over time these agents will interact economically, buying and selling artificial goods, consuming and saving, investing and trading. Using such models, aggregate economic relationships will emerge in cross-section as well as over time. The overall goal is to end up with a behaviorally rich model of an economy 'under glass,' so to speak-an artificial economy-that can be calibrated to real economies of today. If successful, this research will move macroeconomics away from highly stylized models and empirically unrealistic behavioral specifications, to models that are more believable. Ultimately, the goal of such efforts is to produce macroeconomic models that have high performance at predicting the near term unfolding of an economy, thus providing more accurate forecasts of economic evolution. These models could aid policy-makers in their decision-making, which in turn could translate into potentially very large increases in the performance of the economy.

Donahue of Carnegie-Mellon University. This research will probe the basic reaction dynamics controlling ozonolysis reactions between unsaturated hydrocarbons and ozone in the gas phase and on cold surfaces. The factors which control which bonds break when the primary ozonide, formed when ozone reacts with alkene double bonds, breaks up and what controls the exact structure of the resulting reaction products will be determined. By combining computational studies with experimental kinetics in multiple phases, the research will isolate factors potentially responsible for governing the chemical behavior of ozone-alkene reactions. By studying both cycloalkenes, where the reaction products are tethered and the reaction energy thus resides entirely in a single fragment, and non-cyclic alkenes, which yield two fragments that each possess a distribution of energies, the research will reveal details of collisional energy transfer and the energy distribution among the reaction fragments.<br/><br/>Among the broader impacts of this research is its impact in learning about air pollution. Ozonolysis is responsible for significant radical production in urban and regional atmospheric chemistry; it thus plays a central role in photochemical smog formation. It is also a major source of ultrafine organic aerosols, which are a significant health hazard. Consequently, understanding the mechanistic details of ozonolysis is vital to developing control strategies for urban air quality. Aerosol generation initiated when ozone invades buildings and reacts with various household and industrial solvents is also a significant public health concern. These issues will serve as a cornerstone for curricular development revolving around an ozonolysis demonstration suitable for both public and undergraduate education. Also important is the training of young scientists in an area where basic fundamental chemical studies will have a significant impact on a problem of considerable concern to the public.

For this purpose, prosodic features are extracted from the speech signal over regions defined by automatically detectable events. The result is a variable-length sequence of usually high-dimensional vectors, with mixed discrete and continuous distributions and undefined values. The focus of the project is the search for a transformation that, when applied to the prosodic features, results in a single vector that can adequately represent the important characteristics of the original sequence of prosodic features. The proposed transform is formed by projecting the distribution of the features in a certain sample onto a set of probability distributions represented by dynamic Bayesian networks in a predetermined dictionary.<br/><br/>The ultimate goal of the project is the creation of a general probabilistic model-based transform paradigm that can act robustly on complex feature sets. This work will therefore also contribute to other domains where features exhibit characteristics that are challenging for standard approaches. The tools and corpora developed during the project will be made available to the community. The results from this project will contribute to scientific knowledge on the use of prosodic information and increase the capabilities of spoken language understanding and dialog systems.

The outbreak of West Nile virus (WNV) in New York City (NYC) in 1999 revealed that even affluent societies are not invincible to emerging diseases. Global climate change is predicted to exacerbate this problem. Although there is a great body of knowledge about the biology of vector-borne diseases (including WNV) and transmission dynamics in rural and semi-rural landscapes, the urban ecology of such diseases is poorly understood. Particularly lacking is a comprehensive understanding of how the built environment directly and indirectly affects transmission, spread, and evolution and how urban environments under anthropogenic influence affect disease dynamics. This study will explore three hypotheses:<br/><br/>1. Spatial variation in the built environment leads to percolation-like spread rather than wave-like spread of classical epidemic models.<br/><br/>2. The pattern of annual outbreaks is explained by the interaction of seasonal temperature fluctuations and random variation in precipitation interacting with a dynamical infection process.<br/><br/>3. Evolution toward avirulence to humans is a byproduct of evolution toward avirulence in birds and/or adaptation in mosquitoes.<br/><br/>Each hypothesis will be addressed by theoretical models fit to data on WNV outbreaks in NYC between 1999 and 2006. <br/><br/>Results will identify links between the ecology of the built environment and the public health of nearly ten million New Yorkers. Theoretical disease ecology will be advanced by focusing on seasonal forcing, transmission in urban environments, and circulation of multi-vector multi-host pathogens. New knowledge of emerging urban vector-borne diseases will be produced by developing an understanding of this disease system as a model. The researchers will work closely with public health officers in the New York Department of Health and Mental Hygiene to develop recommendations and ecologically-based risk maps that will be useful for controlling WNV in NYC. The research also will include training of two undergraduate students, one graduate student, and one postdoctoral researcher.

Examples include remote surgery, physical manipulation of nano-structures, autonomous (ground and air) vehicular travel, and space and terrestrial exploration. Because such applications interact directly with the physical world, it is imperative their physical safety be assured. This project is developing a comprehensive formal framework for producing controllers for cyber-physical systems, with machine checkable proofs of their physical safety. The project brings together ideas from control theory, language design, program verification, program generation, software engineering, and real-time and embedded systems to build a framework that can be applied to challenging applications. The framework promotes an efficient, rigorous engineering process for producing embedded controllers, incorporating explicit models not only of the controller itself, but also of the physical context in which it operates, the required stability conditions, the platform on which it will run, and the associated real-time constraints. The results of the project are being demonstrated and evaluated in the context of a tele-surgery application. This application is currently being developed at the Mechatronics and Haptic Interfaces Lab in the Mechanical Engineering Department at Rice University.

Students are provided a personally registered remote control that is used to answer conceptual questions during the actual class. The questions are text-, diagram- or graph-based multiple choice questions that focus on one key concept. They are intended to reinforce material presented in class. They provide immediate feedback to students as class responses are collected in near-real time and displayed on a graph at the front of the classroom. Students and instructors analyze the graphs, discuss the results and use that information to guide subsequent activities. Small group discussion of class responses is the primary mode of instruction. We are analyzing over 9000 student responses to identify questions that can be used as reliable in-class assessments at other institutions. Teaching and learning aids are also being developed to help students identify ways to better prepare for class so that they are successful in and out of class. We are varying the types of questions, amounts of response data students see and questioning techniques to determine which combinations provide the richest learning experiences. Data are being collected in six different states at community colleges, four-year colleges and research universities. The intellectual merit of this proposal includes analyses of data regarding the utility of using electronic response system and questions across populations, disciplines and educational settings and identification of better ways to ensure a scientifically literate population of non-science majors. The broader impact of this proposal includes the thorough study and documentation of student response to these questions by gender and ethnicity. Such documentation is leading to recommendations for how faculty can employ such assessments in the most inclusive way possible.

Considerable attention has been focused recently on testing the validity of the snowball Earth hypothesis, radiometrically dating the glacial deposits, and understanding what geological conditions were responsible for the onset of global cooling in the middle Neoproterozoic. However, only limited work has been done on the geochemistry of sediments deposited between the Sturtian and Marinoan ice ages, despite the fact that these preserve the most direct and continuous record of the Neoproterozoic Earth system during this tumultuous climatic epoch. This proposal represents an unparalleled investigation into dynamics of the global sulfur cycle during the ca.55 Myr interglacial interval, using both the sulfur and oxygen isotope composition of carbonateassociated sulfate (CAS) and the sulfur isotope composition of sedimentary pyrite from sediments of the Abenab Subgroup in northern Namibia. The principal objectives of the proposal are to constrain ocean chemistry in the aftermath of the Sturtian glacial event, examine the relationship between ocean redox and the geochemical cycles of carbon and sulfur for the middle Neoproterozoic, and test hypotheses regarding possible trigger mechanisms for the Marionan glaciation. In recent years, significant improvements to the understanding of the Precambrian exogenic sulfur cycle have been made possible by advances involving the sulfur isotope composition of CAS. Typically, these research efforts characterize sulfur isotope evolution for a given time period by assessing the sulfur isotope composition of CAS through a single stratigraphic section at one locality. In this proposal, a different approach is taken. The sulfur isotope evolution of interglacial seawater sulfate will be evaluated using the sulfur isotope composition of CAS and pyrite in multiple sections along a transect perpendicular to the paleo-shoreline. Recent work has shown that large lateral d34Ssulfate gradients developed in the aftermath of the Marinoan glaciation (Hurtgen et al., 2006). These results have important implications for the reconstruction of the Neoproterozoic 34Ssulfate record and the timing of the growth of the marine sulfate reservoir. This project will focus on both the temporal and spatial variability of CAS d34S and d18O data to establish the intrinsic scatter in isotopic compositions preserved in CAS, evaluate the effects diagenesis and of sea level on marine sulfur isotope composition, and determine whether lateral d34S gradients were a feature of interglacial times or if they were typical only of the post-glacial ocean. Tandem d34S-d18O data will be used to compare the oceanographic conditions following the Sturtian and Marinoan glaciations and to constrain the trigger mechanisms for the onset of glaciation. The results of this project will also establish d34 S(sulfate-pyrite) and help to ascertain the complex set of feedbacks that link ocean redox and the geochemical cycles of carbon and sulfur and how these feedbacks may have operated to influence climate in the middle Neoproterozoic.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: (1) This project will provide training to one graduate student in field research techniques and analytical isotope geochemistry and an opportunity for that student to work collaboratively with colleagues from another institution. (2) The data generated from this project will be the nucleus of a new website devoted to the storage of all Neoproterozoic sulfur data generated through publicly funded projects. Other workers in the field will be encouraged to contribute their published data to be archived in an easily accessed and consistent manner. (3) In order to attract under-represented youth to the Earth Sciences, the PI will participate in the Project EXCITE program, which links Northwestern's Center for Talent Development with local schools to identify scientifically-inclined minority students and support the development of their math and science skills through high school. The PI will recruit an EXCITE student to participate in this project.

During the early deglaciation (roughly 16,600 to 13,000 BC), cataclysmic floods from proglacial Lake Missoula inundated eastern Washington-Oregon and passed into the Pacific Ocean via the Cascadia Basin. While we know that turbidity currents originating from these floods penetrated nearly 1000 km into the North Pacific to depths over 3km there is little understanding of the impact of this freshwater discharge on ocean circulation or climate. Unlike the North Atlantic, the most likely scenario for climate impact from freshwater discharge into the Northeast Pacific involves changes in structure of the upper ocean and thermocline properties. <br/><br/>This project will conduct modeling experiments (idealized ocean-only and fully-coupled numerical CCSM3 model simulations) to explore the impacts of a surface layer discharge event versus convection from a hyperpycnal, subsurface flow to test the hypothesis that flood induced changes in N. Pacific subploar-subtropical ocean circulation could influence the position of the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ), thereby providing a mechanism for influencing climate via tropical air-sea interaction. The project will also use radiocarbon date core material to establish a chronology of outburst events.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts of Proposed Work<br/><br/>This project will enhance collaborations between physical oceanographers, paleoceanographers and paleoclimatologists. The Pacific Northwest Pleistocene floods are a phenomenon of great interest to the general public because they dramatically affected much of the regional landscape. Results of the proposed research will be used to educate the public about processes of current day climate change through connections to changes seen during glacial times. A young female post-doc will receive valuable cross-disciplinary training from three leading scientists in the geosciences.

LaSalle	07/31/2008	$50,000.00		harchol@cs.cmu.edu	5000 Forbes Avenue	PITTSBURGH	PA	152133815	4122689527	CSE	7354	7354, 9218, HPCC	$0.00	This proposal is for seed money to enable research in the area of limited resource sharing systems. The goal is to establish enough results so as to warrant the submission of a full proposal in 12 months.<br/><br/>In limited resource sharing systems, the degree of sharing between jobs is limited. An example is a time-sharing (processor-sharing) system, such as a CPU, where a fixed Multi-Programming-Limit (MPL) is imposed, so that only MPL number of jobs can share the CPU at a time.<br/>Another example is the classic M/G/k multiserver queueing system, with a fixed limit, k, on the number of servers.<br/><br/>Although such limited resource sharing systems are quite prevalent in computer systems and manufacturing systems, their analysis has stymied researchers for decades. This proposal makes a breakthrough in the analysis of such systems, by observing that the third moment of the job size distribution plays a critical role in their analysis -- a fact that has gone unnoticed all these years. The proposal seeks to understand this effect and find more accurate analyses of these important systems.<br/><br/>This proposal is a collaboration between two schools, Carnegie Mellon University and Georgia Institute of Technology, and thus a portion of the funds will be used to pay for travel between the two universities.

The approach is to employ a set of finite-element and plane-wave-expansion techniques to provide accurate multi-scale simulation and analytical description of the electromagnetism in anisotropic metamaterials, starting from nanometer scales of metamaterial units, to micrometer scales of optical devices, to millimeter scales of integrated photonic circuits. <br/>Intellectual merit<br/>The emerging area of negative refractive index media has already resulted in revision of such fundamental laws of nature as refraction and diffraction. Anisotropy-based waveguides, which form the backbone of the proposed research, provide solutions to two fundamental problems associated with conventional negative-index systems: resonant absorption and sensitivity to fabrication imperfections. The proposed research will address the fundamental properties of anisotropic negative-index systems, including coupling between micro- and nanoscale structures, sub-diffraction manipulation of optical signals, and evolution of optical nonlinearities. <br/>Broader impacts <br/>From the fundamental standpoint, proposed research will have its implications in physics (light-matter interaction), biology and chemistry (imaging, sensing, spectroscopy), and engineering (optical computing). From the educational standpoint, proposed activities will lead to an updated curriculum and interactive Java-based tutorial, reflecting recent developments in metamaterials and negative refraction. From the societal standpoint, the proposed research has a potential to revolutionize the areas of sensing, imaging, and communications.

Alloy has been used in a wide variety of design analyses. Researchers use Alloy as a tool or back-end for their own tools; over thirty courses use Alloy today. It was recently used to model and check the transfer protocol of Mondex, an electron purse system. Twenty five students built the Analyzer over 5 years ago. However, the infrastructure suffers serious deficiencies, partly due to the fact that its individual components are not cleanly separated. Now this Analyzer has become fragile and bloated. This infrastructure aims to correct this situation. Its development comprises:<br/>- Tools and components,<br/>- Educational Materials, including course modules, case studies, sample problems, and common patterns, and a <br/>- Community Repository, allowing the sharing of tools, components, educational materials, and research papers.<br/>End-user applications will include a new version of the Alloy Analyzer, a tool for checking code against Alloy specifications, and an example-based modeling tool. The applications will be built on all-documented, cleanly separated components that will be made available to researchers: a new engine that can handle large configurations in addition to model constraints, a code front-end, a visualizer, and a translator for JML to Alloy. This infrastructure aims to create and enable a community that will use Alloy as an intellectual sandbox to explore fundamental and far-reaching questions faced by the field.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: Because the Alloy Analyzer itself, with its concrete and immediate visual feedback, plays the role of a very critical but constructive tutor, Alloy is particularly well suited to formal methods education in small college settings. Moreover, Alloy serves the larger community of educators and researchers.
0718480	Cognitive Neuroscience of Empathy	BCS	SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY, COGNEURO	09/01/2007	08/10/2007	Jean Decety	IL	University of Chicago	Standard Grant	Akaysha Tang	02/28/2013	$650,000.00	John Cacioppo	decety@uchicago.edu	5801 South Ellis Avenue	Chicago	IL	606375418	7737028669	SBE	1332, 1699	0000, 1699, OTHR	$0.00	Empathy refers to the capacity to understand and respond to the unique affective experiences of another person. Knowledge of empathic behavior is essential for an understanding of human social and moral development. Current trends in empathy theory suggest that empathy involves two inter-related primary components: (a) an automatic affective response to another person, which often entails sharing that person?s emotional state; and (b) a cognitive capacity to take the perspective of the other person. Furthermore, these two components are experienced without confusing the self with the other. The basic mechanism for empathy rests on the ability to recognize that the self and other are similar, but also on an ability to differentiate between the two. With support from the National Science Foundation, Dr. Jean Decety and colleagues at the University of Chicago will address the psychological and neural mechanisms involved in the experience of empathy by combining the approaches of cognitive neuroscience and social psychology. Neural activity during the experience of empathy will be compared across various situational and dispositional factors which are well documented in social psychology. Brain imaging (functional magnetic resonance imaging) will be used to measure the effects of stigma, racial bias, similarity and past shared experiences between self and others on the automatic resonance between self and other. There will be a special emphasis on the case of perception of pain, which has proven to be fairly universal and also typical of other processes. In all studies dispositional measures of individual differences in emotion contagion, empathy, sensitivity to pain, will be collected to allow for a fuller explication of the brain results. <br/><br/>This work will yield a better understanding of the cognitive and neurophysiological mechanisms involved in empathy and sympathy as well as several factors, seemingly unique to human kind, that influence or modulate our ability to share feelings and care for others. Both the findings and the techniques will be of value to clinicians as well as other researchers. This work will also contribute to teaching and training of students, especially interdisciplinary training between neuroscience and social psychology. Some of the proposed research will investigate the impact of racial group membership on the neural networks that mediate empathy and work on racial stereotypes and racial information processing has been an area of interest to undergraduate and graduate students from underrepresented minority groups. Thus this work may increase the attractiveness of neuroscience for students from these groups.

Using infrared, Raman, vibrational circular dichroism (VCD), and fluorescence techniques, Keiderling and his students will study flexible peptide molecules of different lengths and varying sequences of amino acid residues that are designed to fold into beta-hairpin structures. These molecules will provide models for the study of the elementary steps in beta-sheet folding. The project will emphasize the use of polypeptides, selectively labeled with carbon-13, which can be studied with IR, Raman, or VCD spectroscopy to determine site-specific, local peptide structures. Conformational changes will be induced by varying the temperature, solvent, and pH under equilibrium conditions. Time-dependent, temperature jump spectroscopy will be used to investigate the dynamics of unfolding the peptide structure. These experiments will be combined with ab-initio quantum mechanical calculations to model short- and long-range interactions between peptide bonds in molecules with a variety of conformations. Molecular dynamics methods will be employed to simulate the mechanisms for polypeptide folding. Beta-sheets are critical components for several toxic mis-folded peptide and protein states. The information gained from these studies will improve our understanding of protein folding and impact areas of biochemistry and structural biology.
0719130	Collaborative Research: Effects of a Regional Plio-Pleistocene Extinction Event on the Escalation of Predator-Prey Interactions	EAR	SURFACE EARTH PROCESS SECTION	08/01/2007	08/10/2007	Gregory Dietl	NY	Paleontological Research Institute	Standard Grant	H. Richard Lane	07/31/2010	$70,500.00		gpd3@cornell.edu	1259 Trumansburg Road	Ithaca	NY	148501313	6072736623	GEO	7570	0000, OTHR, 4444	$0.00	As humans continue to transform the world's ecosystems through the loss of species, fragmentation of habitats and global redistribution of species, we are increasingly re-creating conditions not unlike those of past extinctions. How will species respond to such changes in their environment? Lineage-specific, habitat-specific, and regionally constrained information on what adaptive solutions work best in particular kinds of environments and selective regimes in the aftermath of crises is critical if we are to manage and anticipate the long-term consequences of human-induced environmental changes. Towards this goal of better understanding the effects of ecological losses on species interactions, PIs plan to test the hypothesis of escalation, which claims that as biological hazards become more severe adaptations to those hazards increase in expression. The study will focus on fighting conchs (snails of the Strombus alatus complex) and their crab predators in the abundant fossil record of the Plio-Pleistocene of Florida before and after a regional mass extinction event at the end of the Pliocene. Given a basic theoretical understanding of how changes in predation pressure should affect adaptation to enemies, and the previous inference that levels of predation peaked in the Pliocene and declined in the Pleistocene following the extinction event, escalation between fighting conchs and crabs is predicted to have slowed or halted after the Pliocene. The material that will be collected and studied for this proposal will also be used to develop hands-on, inquiry-based activities for teaching about evolution. In particular, secondary school students will be introduced to the concepts of fossils as records of biological evolution and environmental change, and shells as records of predator-prey relationships and adaptation, connecting to a number of National Science Education Standards.

Primary partners include the American Library Association, National Institute on Out of School Time (NIOST), Center for the Mathematics Education of Latinos/as, and statewide library agencies. Deliverables include six to ten culturally responsive, bilingual (English and Spanish) interdisciplinary projects and 15-20 short math/library games for children and their families. Each project includes a theme, a mathematical focus, math related books, interdisciplinary activities, take-home materials for families, and outreach and training materials for informal educators. Project materials build on activities developed in the NSF-funded Mixing in the Math project (04-06675) and will be accessible on the Internet. Regional network leaders will be selected from partner sites in AZ, CA, CT, FL, NY, MA, and MO. TERC staff will work with regional network leaders to train children''s librarians in the use of Math off the Shelf materials. Librarians then train afterschool educators to incorporate topics such as number and operation, geometry, algebraic thinking, measurement, and data analysis into activities for K-6 students and their families. A culminating family event enables students to showcase their math knowledge for community members. Dissemination occurs via citywide, regional, and statewide networks. The project will strategically impact the field via the development of culturally-responsive mathematics materials for families. Additionally, the extensive national dissemination plan incorporates a comprehensive evaluation designed to address curriculum development, audience participation, and institutional impact. It is anticipated that this project will reach 900 children''s librarians and afterschool educators and 9,000 children and their families.

Landis, Department of Chemistry, University of Wisconsin-Madison is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division to investigate the synthesis of new transition metal ligands and their applications in transition metal catalyzed reactions. One goal of this work is creation of new extensible and chiral 3,4-diazaphospholane ligands. Chiral 3,4-diazaphospholanes enable the synthesis of ligand libraries with diverse functional groups that create ?enzyme-like? environments around catalytically active transition metal centers. A second goal emphasizes application of 3,4-diazaphospholane-libraries to discover of catalysts for carbon-carbon bond forming reactions, such as hydroformylation, that yield chiral products with high selectivity and atom economy. Pharmaceutical intermediates constitute a major target. Understanding the mechanism by which 3,4-diazaphospholane ligands effect enantioselective hydroformylation of simple substrates such as styrene and vinyl acetate to produce chiral, functionalized aldehydes constitutes a third goal. Such mechanistic studies enable elucidation of the rate- and selectivity-determining reaction steps and how they are influenced by ligand structure.<br/>This project advances the state-of-the-art of enantioselective, transition-metal catalyzed transformations through the design and synthesis of novel organophosphine compounds. Efficient, selective, and atom economical transformations catalyzed by chiral transition metal complexes represent a critical technology for the synthesis of chiral pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and natural products. New enantioselective processes for hydroformylation resulting from this project will broadly impact organic synthesis by providing new pathways to chiral aldehydes and reducing waste associated with the production of enantiomerically pure stereogenic centers. This research provides graduate and undergraduate researchers with broad training and development of technical skills. The PI and students involved in this project will develop new hands-on activities to demonstrate the meaning and power of catalysis to novice chemistry students.

Isaac of the University of Missouri, Rolla, are supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program for their research on redox magnetoconvection of solution in small-scale electrochemical systems. The research will greatly expand the understanding of the fundamental science of redox magnetoconvective fluidics (stirring/mixing and directed flow) as it pertains to small-scale, liquid-based systems, through experiment and modeling. The relative impact of the Lorentz, concentration-gradient, and magnetic-field gradient forces will be considered. A variety of microelectrode geometries, dimensions, configurations, and arrays will be used in studies to determine how spatial distribution of chemical species, magnitude of faradaic and non-faradaic current and magnetic field vectors, as well as the nature of the current carrying species, contribute to flow dynamics, velocities, and profiles. Mathematical modeling and numerical simulations will be used to aid in understanding the many factors that contribute to the flow and to deconvolute factors that are experimentally impossible to separate.<br/><br/>Small-scale fluid propulsion, or microfluidics, is essential in chip-based devices to pump and mix liquids, leading to automated chemical analysis having applications in proteomics, genomics, environmental, medical and clinical areas. The findings of the proposed studies will help to determine the role and extent that redox magnetoconvection could participate in this application.

A model seminar curriculum developed by a team of professional ethicists and GIS&T educators will be developed and disseminated freely to the GIS&T education community in the U.S. and overseas. This project addresses the fact that GIS&T is a large and rapidly-growing multidisciplinary field concerned with the nature, use, and societal impacts of information derived from geospatial technologoes. Technologies such as the Global Positioning System (GPS), satellite remote sensing, and geographic information systems (GIS) enable analysts to track people and tehings, to evaluate natural resources and monitor land uses, to identify optimal sites and routes, and to target areas for further investigation or intervention. As such, ethical issues related to: 1) privacy of individuals and use of geospatial technologies as surveillance tools; 2) appropriate use of data collected using these methods for policy decisions; and, 3) consequences of inequities that arise through biased access to geospatial tools and derived data. A panel of ethicists and educators will be convened to develop a seminar curriculum that engages students in the philosophical foundations of ethics, in echniques for assessing and strengthening moral reasoning ability, and the ethical issues associated with GIS&T. Student interactions with GIS&T professionals will be used to develop case studies that illuminate practical situations and professional responses to them. The curriculum will be widely disseminated through the Association of American Geographers and through virtual seminars at PSU.

The dissolved chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) on sections between Tasmania and Antarctica along 140'E in 2007-8 and along 170'W between 50'S and the equator in 2008-9 will be measured. This will be the fourth occupation of both these sections with chlorofluorocarbon tracers (CFC) and carbon system measurements since 1990. All three Chlorofluorocarbons: CFC-11, CFC-12, and CFC-113 will be measured on both sections, and SF6 will be measured on at least the pacific line. These tracer measurements complement the hydrographic observations that will include dissolved nutrients and carbon system parameters. The CFCs emphasize the contrast between newly-ventilated cold waters and the older, circumpolar waters of northern origin, and provide a clock to help understand observed changes in water mass properties in a circumpolar band located on the north side of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, associated with the thick cold mixed layers where Subantarctic Mode Water and Antarctic Intermediate Water. <br/><br/>These measurements will be interpreted in collaboration with the Australian colleagues. A variety of approaches to data analysis, including comparison with general circulation model output, will be utilized to interpret changes in the CFC concentrations and derived ages. Both numerical models and transit time distributions will be utilized to interpret the pCFC ages. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts of Proposed Work<br/><br/>This proposed research continues a long-term collaboration with Australian scientists, continues the training of a graduate student in model-data comparisons who will participate one of the expeditions, and provides data on changes in intermediate water formation rates and bottom waters that will help us better understand the role of the Southern Ocean in climate change and anthropogenic CO2 uptake. There is no seawater CFC measurement laboratory in the Australian oceanographic community. These CFC measurements make an important contribution to the interpretation of both the hydrographic and carbon system measurements of the Australian researchers. The Australian oceanographers have agreed to the data policy of the CLIVAR/Carbon Repeat Hydrography Program. These data from one of the regions of the ocean that is potentially important to studies of the ocean's response to changes in surface forcing will be publicly available soon after the voyages.

The results will be applied to the study of stochastic volatility models with Levy-driven CARMA volatility and to the further study of COGARCH models. Time series in which the parameters are constant over time-intervals between ``change-points'' constitute an important class of non-stationary time series which has been found particularly useful in hydrology, seismology and finance. Properties and applications of a new estimation technique based on the minimization of the minimum description length of a model that includes the number of change-points and their locations as parameters will be developed and extended to cover a general class of processes with structural breaks of various types. Estimation techniques for all-pass models driven by non-Gaussian noise will also be developed.  These techniques, including maximum likelihood and minimum dispersion estimation, will be applied to the problem of identification and estimation for non-causal or non-invertible ARMA models.Adaptive techniques for efficient estimation of such models will be explored.<br/><br/>In the last fifteen years, there has been a widely-recognized need for the development of new models and techniques for the analysis of time series data from scientific, engineering, biomedical, and financial applications. Some of the features required of these new models are nonlinearity, complex dependence structures, strong deviations from normality and non-stationarity. The current proposal addresses these needs. It seeks to enhance understanding of the physical and economic processes represented by the models. The development of efficient estimation and simulation techniques will be an essential component of the research.

It will be held between June 18 and 21, 2008 at the US National Academy of Sciences' Jonsson Conference Center in Woods Hole, Massachusetts. Between 60 and 80 attendees from the US and abroad are expected.<br/><br/>The benefits to Science from the Symposium are: (a) It will provide an unprecedented opportunity to extend the study of Mechanics in Biology to the cellular and molecular levels, from the more traditional biomechanical focus on tissues. (b) Since biophysicists and biologists apply ideas of Elasticity and Structural Mechanics quite widely in studying molecules and cells, there is a strong reason to bring together the communities of Mechanics and Biology and catalyze greater interaction between them. The convening of the Symposium in the US will promote the continued leadership role of US academic institutions in this emerging discipline. Deciphering the mechanical basis of Biology is expected to qualitatively transform the understanding and treatment of disease in the future, thereby delivering significant benefits to Health Care. Support of the Symposium by the NSF is indicative of the premium importance placed on interdisciplinary, leading edge science that has the potential to improve the health of a longer living population. The Symposium will include a poster session exclusively for graduate/undergraduate students and post-doctoral researchers. It will thus help train the next generation of scientists in this emerging discipline. The Symposium will foster an international exchange of ideas, since roughly half the participants will come from countries besides the US. It will culminate in a panel discussion with the objective of identifying issues of critical importance in cellular, molecular and tissue mechanics for the next 5 to 10 years.
0719234	Doctoral Dissertation Research: Medical Tourism as Economic Recovery in Post-Crisis Argentina	BCS	CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY	09/01/2007	08/05/2007	Peter Guarnaccia	NJ	Rutgers University New Brunswick	Standard Grant	Deborah Winslow	02/28/2009	$7,070.00		guarnaccia@aesop.rutgers.edu	33 Knightsbridge Road	Piscataway	NJ	088543925	8489320150	SBE	1390	1390, 9179, SMET	$0.00	Graduate student Emily McDonald, supervised by Dr. Peter Guarnaccia, will undertake research on the transnational practice of medical tourism in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Driven by the rising cost of healthcare, medical tourists from the U.S., U.K. and other countries seek comparatively inexpensive surgeries packaged alongside leisure pursuits, such as tango lessons and wine tasting. In order to attract these foreign patients, doctors in Argentina are making connections with local tourist industries, establishing medical tourism as a key economic recovery strategy in response to the 2001 economic crisis. While becoming generalized as a health care practice, what remains largely unexamined is how medical tourism is emerging as a significant social practice embedded within the particular economic, political and historical contexts of Argentina.<br/><br/>Tracing medical tourist networks through semi-structured interviews, participant observation and the collection of oral histories, the researcher will investigate medical tourism in Argentina. The project will address the following questions: 1) How are newly created medical tourism networks linking previously unconnected people, both within Argentina and transnationally? 2) In what ways does medical tourism, as an economic recovery strategy, inform our understanding of economic and political conditions within Argentina? 3) How are historically and culturally embedded concepts of race and nationality used to market medical tourism to Buenos Aires, and to differentiate Argentina from other medical tourism destinations?<br/><br/> Understanding the dynamics of medical tourism will speak to mainstream debates around healthcare, and will advance understandings of transnationalism, economic recovery and the commodification of biomedicine. The research also will contribute to the education of a social scientist.

At the same time, especially in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, nationalist sentiments and politicized ethnic mobilizations put pressure on states to be responsive to local concerns. These conflicting pressures create a difficult challenge, especially for the 15 newly created states that emerged from the former Soviet Union. Multiple methods are employed to understand the complex political processes in these newly created states. Quantitative analyses are combined with qualitative archival data to examine the parliamentary debates on citizenship legislation and the degree of exclusiveness or inclusiveness in the resulting legislation. These analyses focus on the interplay of external and internal pressures in political debate and in the implementation of citizenship and naturalization policies. <br/><br/>This research will increase understanding of the challenges confronting young states, especially in core policy domains such as citizenship and naturalization. Empirically, this dissertation research enriches our understanding of the dynamics of ethnic and political integration in multicultural post-Soviet republics on the local, regional, and international levels. These insights are valuable to policy makers and citizens committed to the promotion of democracy and political stability in this region.

The project will involve researchers from Turkey, Panama, and England along with industrial advisors from Travelocity and Lockheed and will focus on issues related to teaching undergraduate computer science students how to use computer-supported collaborative tools to work together to develop large software applications. Researchers will enhance a Web service infrastructure that can support collaborative software tools and use it in advanced programming courses offered at each of the four Universities. The courses will allow researchers to examine how 'distance' factors such as time, geography and culture affect globally distributed student learners. Data gathered from student interactions will then be used to create strategies that will improve collaboration among the culturally, spatially, and temporally dispersed learning teams. The result of this research will be a model and technology that will focus on the problems related to teaching global software development. These problems include teaching students how to use collaborative software, be members of a culturally diverse work team, manage time, organize ideas, and chat (communicate) with one another. <br/><br/>This project will examine ways to use technology to help students learn how to overcome barriers of time, space and culture. The proposed research represents an important contribution by teaching students how to work in culturally mixed dispersed teams. It will also contribute to practical knowledge about how to support distributed learning teams by determining which specific individual, spatial-temporal, and cultural factors are important and how they interact in the context of a computer supported collaborative environment. It will also test whether specific problems can be remediated through direct or indirect intervention, and whether these remediation strategies actually improve group performance. Although this study will occur in the context of a programming course, the results will have implications for geographically distributed collaborative learning teams in general. It should also have an effect on broadening the experiences of all students who participate in the study by exposing them to people from different cultures and nationalities
0726475	Collaborative Research:  Rapid Gravitational Adjustment of Horizontal Shear:  A Recipe for Energetic Mixing in the Coastal Ocean	OCE	PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY	09/01/2007	08/10/2007	Alberto Scotti	NC	University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill	Standard Grant	Eric C.

This configuration of shear and stratification is common in strongly time-dependent flows in the coastal ocean including estuarine inflows and outflows, separating flows around headlands and islands, and merging flows in morphologically complex regions such as tidal inlets. The resulting buoyancy-driven flow results in tilting and intense stretching of the shear-flow vortices and ultimately a breakdown of the flow leading to intense vertical mixing. Horizontal stratification in the presence of horizontal shear has the potential to strongly enhance mixing, despite the fact that the gravity-driven flow by itself increases the vertical stratification. The research into the dynamics and consequences of this process will involve both high-resolution non-hydrostatic numerical modeling and comprehensive laboratory experiments utilizing particle image velocimetry and laser-induced fluorescence. Scaling arguments for this highly nonlinear evolution have been developed and will guide the investigation. It is expected that the results will inform future parameterizations of mixing processes that are crucial in coastal ocean circulation models. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts <br/>Coastal mixing processes are important for pollutant transport and dilution, biogeochemical cycles of nutrients and carbon in the productive coastal zone, and the transport of marine larvae and plankton. The results of this study will yield understanding that should lead to improved parameterizations for mixing that can be incorporated into estuarine water quality, coastal ocean circulation, and ecological models. The PIs are both active in their respective academic programs (MIT/WHOI Joint Program and UNC Marine Science) and the results of this research will quickly reach the classroom. The grant will also provide important early career support for undergraduate and graduate students will be incorporated into aspects of the research through the WHOI Summer Student Fellowship Program and the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics (GFD) Summer Program at WHOI. The grant will support the continued operation of the WHOI GFD Laboratory, which has hosted over 100 visiting students and scientists over the last 30 years to undertake a variety of experiments spanning physical oceanography, atmospheric dynamics, fluid dynamics, and geological processes. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>

In response to the challenge of malicious media manipulation, we propose to develop new theories, methods, and a comprehensive suite of tools that can be used to verify content integrity in both audio and visual modalities at multiple levels under diverse contexts. The results will have significant impacts in scientific areas as well as many practical applications of national interest, such as trustworthy news reporting, surveillance security, intelligence gathering, criminal investigation, financial transactions, and medical information management. Our efforts will be based on an important paradigm, called blind passive media forensics, which fundamentally differs from conventional approaches using cryptographic signatures and watermarking. The proposed methods extract latent, unique signatures from the signals and sensing devices to detect tampering anomalies, so that verification requires only the media content at hand without any additional information or preparation. Specifically, we propose a systematic framework for device signature consistency checking and a joint multi-modal approach for verifying media integrity. We will also analyze various attack scenarios, construct rigorous benchmark datasets and performance metrics, and take proactive steps in disseminating results and promoting awareness of this critical area through public testing of online systems.

Because these methods rely on the Friedmann equation, which has not been independently tested, it is desirable to find alternative methods that work for both general relativity and other theories of gravity. This project will develop methods for using large-scale structure, microwave background anisotropy, and weak gravitational lensing measurements, to test models of dark energy, especially models based on modified theories of gravity. A key goal of this research is to develop theories and methods for broad tests of the hypothesis that dark energy is due to modified gravity instead of a cosmological constant or dynamical fluid.<br/><br/>The investigator will involve gifted high school students and undergraduates in the research, along with the training and education of graduate students. The results will also be used to inform the researcher's continuing outreach efforts to university alumni and other non-specialist groups.

Badecker	07/31/2011	$147,001.00	Steven Bird	myl@unagi.cis.upenn.edu	Research Services	Philadelphia	PA	191046205	2158987293	SBE	1311	0000, OTHR	$0.00	Language resources are the bread and butter of language documentation and linguistic investigation. They include the primary objects of study such as texts and recordings, the outputs of research such as dictionaries and grammars, and the enabling technologies such as software tools and interchange standards. Increasingly, these resources are maintained and distributed in digital form. Although language resources have begun to proliferate on the web, they are often difficult or impossible to locate and reuse. In this collaborative research project, Drs. Mark Liberman and Steven Bird of the University of Pennsylvania and Dr. Gary Simons of the Graduate Institute of Applied Linguistics will address this problem through new research to enhance the digital infrastructure of the Open Language Archives Community (OLAC). OLAC provides a standard set of language resource descriptors and a portal that permits users to query dozens of language archives simultaneously using a single search. However, the current coverage of OLAC is only the tip of the iceberg. The aim of the project is to greatly improve access to language resources for linguists and the broader communities of interest, by achieving an order-of-magnitude increase in the coverage of the OLAC catalog and in the use of OLAC search services. The project will do so through two main areas of activity: developing guidelines and services that encourage language archives to follow best common practices that will facilitate language resource discovery through OLAC, and developing services to bridge from the resource catalogs of the library and web domains to the OLAC catalog.<br/><br/>The project should have a broad impact across the field of linguistics by developing an online service that gives linguists access to resources for the thousands of languages in the world. But the impact will extend well beyond the linguistics community. Access to these language resources will assist technologists who are endeavoring to make information technologies work with every language, not just a select few. It will also permit educators, students and members of society at large to access a wealth of materials that demonstrate the full range of linguistic diversity in the world. Yet another audience for access to language resources are the actual speakers of all the languages of the world. In the case of endangered languages, access to language resources is a critical asset in the process of language revitalization. The project will also serve to advocate the widespread use of ISO 639-3, a newly adopted standard that provides codes for precisely identifying the 7,500 known human languages, past and present. This will encourage reform in current cataloging practice which is based on an earlier ISO standard that recognizes fewer than 400 languages, and begin the process of helping the major storehouses of knowledge around the world to deal appropriately with linguistic diversity.

The project also aims to back existing post-manufacturing tuning techniques with deeper analytic methods, and to augment these one-time adjustments with more dynamic management techniques that are ongoing as the system is in use. To make the shift from very static (one-time) tuning towards very dynamic (ongoing) power-performance tuning, one needs models whose detail and abstraction vary. This allows fast, but abstract models to be used dynamically by the operating system, in order to dynamically adjust power/thermal behavior in order to stay within budget while also meeting performance goals. Microarchitectural techniques can also be employed, but likewise need to be informed by good models and measurement techniques to guide their use. The project will address these modeling issues and the associated on-the-fly management techniques.<br/><br/>The research program pursues broad impact in several ways. First, the project has an important component for knowledge dissemination and technology transfer. The modeling and management techniques proposed in this project will be disseminated and released for free use. Building on a record of strong support for undergraduate research and underrepresented groups, the PIs will continue and broaden such activities through this collaboration. Because of the geographic proximity of CMU and Princeton, group meetings unifying the two efforts will be possible throughout the project.

This project will develop logical and computational methods to support both types of activities. Specific components of the project include: the development of formal libraries to support proofs in number theory and discrete geometry; the extraction of verification conditions from software component specifications and implementations in an assertive programming language known as Resolve; a classification of the types of inferences that arise in both domains; the development of logical methods for verifying these inferences automatically; and the development of educational materials and software that will make it possible to integrate these methods into undergraduate and graduate curricula in computer science and mathematics.<br/><br/>As mathematical proofs become more and more intricate, and now often rely on extensive computation, it is becoming increasingly difficult to verify that they are correct. Similarly, as hardware and software systems become more and more complex, it is becoming increasingly difficult to verify that they meet their design specifications. Doing so is especially important when resources, lives, and security depend on their correct behavior. This collaboration between mathematical logicians and computer scientists will develop methods to make it possible to verify that such mathematical and computational claims are valid, and that the arguments supporting them are free of errors. The project will also develop means of training the next generation of computer scientists and mathematicians to use these methods.
0720148	Doctoral Dissertation Research in Political Science:    A Third Term?    An Analysis of the Degree to Which Formal Democratic Institutions Constrain Leaders in Sub-Saharan Africa	SES	POLITICAL SCIENCE	10/01/2007	08/15/2007	Nicolas Van de Walle	NY	Cornell University	Standard Grant	Brian F. Schaffner	09/30/2008	$12,000.00		nv38@cornell.edu	373 Pine Tree Road	Ithaca	NY	148502820	6072555014	SBE	1371	9179, SMET	$0.00	     Over the past ten years a trend has emerged among African democracies whereby many presidents have attempted to amend national constitutions for the purpose of abolishing executive term limits.  Some presidents have been successful in their bids to lift term limits; some have failed; while still other presidents have willingly stepped down after their two terms in office without attempting such a constitutional change.  What causes some leaders to try for a third term while others are content to relinquish power once their constitutionally mandated two terms are up?  Going a step further, among cases where the leader has decided to push for a term limit amendment, what accounts for the success or failure of those bids?  <br/>     The aim of this project is to answer these questions and to take the explanations a step further by examining how the plasticity of term limit laws across Africa affects the prospects of democratic consolidation on the continent.  Understanding the degree to which leaders are constrained from achieving their personal preferences by formal democratic institutions and how presidents can utilize prior informal institutions, such as patronage networks, to gain advantages within the political system can help answer the important question of how and the degree to which formal democratic institutions are influential in Africa.<br/>     The first stage of this project investigates how individual leaders make the decision to either step down after two terms in office or try for a third term by sponsoring a constitutional amendment.  This is carried out through a choice-centered analysis that builds a theoretical decision calculus that is then tested and verified through interviews with former presidents and their close associates, such as cabinet members and ministry heads.  The second stage of the project seeks to uncover the reasons why, after a decision is made to seek a third term, some presidents succeed in getting an amendment passed while others fail. In this stage, both regression analysis and qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) are used to uncover the relevant variables across cases in sub-Saharan Africa, followed by in-country case studies of three nations, Uganda, Tanzania, and Zambia, in order to identify the causal mechanisms that underlie term limit extension bid outcomes.  Data for each case study will be gathered through semi-structured personal interviews, focus group interviews, institutional analysis, archival research, and public opinion data analysis.  <br/>     A broader impact of this study is providing policymakers with the means for understanding when and how presidents can overcome legally set limits to their power, which is crucial in Africa, as well as other regions, because of the painful history of ?big man? rule across the continent.  The brutal past regimes of dictators such as Idi Amin in Uganda, Mobutu Sese Seko in Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of Congo), and Charles Taylor in Liberia are all too vivid in the memories of many Africans.  Uncovering the conditions (both political and social) that allow leaders to flaunt limits to their power is a first step in fostering the conditions in which democracy can survive in these nations.

The instrument will have a resolution of 0.8 angstroms in the scanning transmission mode. It will enable researchers to determine chemistry, atomic structure, bonding characteristics, and three-dimensional imaging of materials at the true atomic level. Although it will be a critical instrument in the support of the wide range of nano-technology and energy research programs at the university, it will also operate as a resource for research institutions, both in industry and academia, in southeastern Michigan and the surrounding states. The instrument will have a 300 kV monochromated field emission gun and will have spherical aberration correction of the probe forming system. The imaging system will allow both scanning imaging and static beam imaging. In scanning imaging with a high angle annual dark field detector this microscope will allow atomic resolution imaging with atomic number contrast. Chemical analysis will be conducted by high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy, convergent beam electron diffraction and energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry.<br/><br/><br/>Non-Technical<br/><br/>This program funds a new high resolution transmission electron microscope, an instrument that images extremely fine structure of material and is critical to successful nanotechnology and energy research in the University of Michigan and other research institutions in southeastern Michigan. In lieu of light, the transmission electron microscope uses a very high energy beam of electrons (300,000 volts) to probe the thin foils or particles of materials. The samples are so thin that 250 of them would be required to match the thickness of the average human hair. The imaging resolution of the new microscope will be higher than any previously located in Michigan. It will, for example, be able to image individual impurity atoms in the atomic lattices of silicon devices. The instrument will also be capable of performing chemical analyses of these samples, using what are known as spectroscopic techniques. Spectroscopy involves measuring the energy range of electrons or X-rays emitted by the sample when the high energy electron beam interacts with it. The instrument will allow researchers in the region to compete globally in research in nanotechnology, energy related materials and biological technologies. It will mean that research requiring materials characterization in Michigan will remain at the leading edge.

The inner, or pearl-like nacreous, layer consists of calcium carbonate in the aragonite crystal morphology and confers fracture toughness on the composite. The outer, or prismatic, layer consists of long prismatic columns of single crystal calcium carbonate in the calcite modification that confers puncture and crack propagation resistance. Both the nacreous and prismatic layers arise initially during shell development from a precursor phase, consisting of amorphous calcium carbonate. Here it is proposed to investigate the detailed mechanism by which the prismatic layer is assembled through the intermediacy of specific negatively charged aspartic acid and glutamic acid-rich proteins, known collectively as Asprich, thought to direct the mineralization process. Proteins of this class have highly conserved sequences at the N and C termini. A peptide (Fragment 1) from the N-terminal domain promotes radial rhombohedral crystal arrangements, while Fragment 2 from the C-terminus promotes porosities or voids at crystal surfaces. This project will utilize synthetic peptides representing Fragments 1 and 2 to understand how conserved sequences control crystal growth and design. In particular, the correlation of primary sequence organization, amino acid identity, secondary structure, and metal ion binding capacity with crystal morphology selection and growth kinetics will be investigated. Scanning electron and atomic force microscopies will be used to examine crystal morphologies. Various biophysical techniques (CD, NMR, isothermal titration calorimetry, mass spectrometry, nano-SIMS, X-ray diffraction, computer simulation) will provide means to examine the properties of the Asprich domains with regard to Ca(II) and Mg(II) binding thermodynamics, 2- and 3D structure, surface electrostatics, and crystal binding and occlusion within the calcite matrix. Collaborations with Brookhaven National Laboratory (E. DiMasi) and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (C. Orme) will provide access to equipment not available locally to the project.<br/><br/>BROADER IMPACTS: The project provides a platform for highly multidisciplinary training of graduate students ranging from peptide synthesis, to various microscopies, to biophysical characterization with synchrotron X-ray diffraction to NMR, nano-SIMS, and isothermal titration calorimetry. The project has the potential to advance the understanding of biomineralization and to provide models for biomimetic composite fabrication. The PI is a participant in the New York Academy of Sciences High School Science Summer Camp and invites 1-2 high school students to the lab to do research experiments. He also participates in the Partners in Science high school science teacher research program which introduces NYC high school science teachers to research projects during their summer vacation.

The research will explore the usefulness of this innovative approach to provide an improved search mechanism for software development artifacts. Such improved searches will be applicable in many circumstances.<br/>This project is exploratory and proposes a set of preliminary research tasks on untested and novel ideas. The results will offer a new way to search for existing support information and historical design information that can help avoid or significantly limit project delays due to software changes. The innovative approach consists of techniques which take advantage of contextual information (e.g., user, project, application, environment, and other contexts) and of semantic networks which store relationships between software artifacts and traceability information. The results of the new search approach will provide a more contextualized, applicable, and targeted recommendation for relevant information to software engineers.<br/>The project will employ one graduate student and one undergraduate student who will be actively engaged in the research project.

Cardiac Sensor Networks (CSNs) could be used to deploy such a system. Moreover, the integration of RFID into CSN could play an important role for elder healthcare because RFID could be used to monitor elders' medicine taking behaviors. On the other hand, the disclosure of RFID information during RFID tag-to-reader communications can cause the violation of patients' privacy. This research aims to achieve trustworthiness in a practical RFID-assisted CSN platform. This project will make the following three contributions: (1) Error-resistant ECG transmission: A trustworthy CSN should be able to overcome the impacts of radio interference and propagation distortions that can lead to frequent ECG transmission errors. This research will use the receiver-only local ECG processing to overcome ECG errors/loss. It will conduct a comparative study of two promising anti-interference methods, Kalman Filter and Tempo-spatial Regression. (2) Low-overhead RFID security: This research will design a lightweight RFID security scheme based on Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) and a mutual authentication scheme. The RFID security will be tested in our current CSN hardware platform. (3) CSN temporal accountability: In ECG sensor applications, all ECG anomaly detections depend on accountable time interval analysis between different ECG signal segments. This research will achieve CSN temporal accountability through the following two technical approaches: i) design a receiver-only clock uncertainty prediction model to avoid wireless communication overhead; and ii) design a history-aware, reputation based trust model to capture the evolutionary timing attacks.

Clusters are small gas-phase aggregates of atoms or molecules whose composition and size characteristics can be controlled in a laboratory setting, allowing their reactivity and growth to be studied. Heterogeneous processes in systems applicable to atmospheric chemistry such as nucleation, solvation and surface adsorption are thus amenable to detailed mechanistic investigation. Systems to be studied include:<br/> . Dissolution and nucleation processes of water cluster ions and acids<br/> . Solvation phenomena in acids and simple salts (e.g., HX where X is a halogen; nitric acid) including halogen replacement, a known atmospheric process<br/> . Existence of biradical ions and ion-pair formation in haloacids and other acid systems<br/> . Nucleation of organic species (e.g., acetone, pyridine, simple carboxylic acids, halogenated organics and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in water clusters).<br/>A broader impact of these investigations is the ongoing dialog between the disciplines of physical chemistry and atmospheric chemistry, including interdisciplinary concept and technique awareness and student training.

These plants are best known as the source of tropical passionfruit, but are also widely cultivated for their beautiful, complex flowers. Passionflowers appear to be a recently-evolved lineage that has experienced rapid species diversification. Many species are poorly understood with regard to morphology, geographical distribution, and conservation status, especially in the largest lineage of passionflowers, subgenus Decaloba, with 235+ species. This study will synthesize modern and traditional approaches to address these problems, using DNA sequence data, scanning electron microscopy, and observation of fresh and preserved specimens. Field work will enable collection of fresh material and documentation of species distributions. This project will yield a revision of all species in Decaloba, and will provide a modern evolutionary framework within which to address questions about the evolution of floral shape, pollination syndromes, floral development, and the biogeographical history of the lineage. <br/><br/>This study will address important biological and evolutionary questions in an especially charismatic group of plants. Undergraduate and graduate students will participate in the research. Undergraduates at Keene State College and Harris-Stowe State University, institutions that primarily enroll underrepresented groups in the sciences, will especially benefit from involvement in this study. Summer workshops at Rancho Santa Ana Botanic Garden will involve students from the local community. Field expeditions will build international collaborations among U.S. scientists and colleagues in Mexico, Central America, and South America. All results of this project will be available through a website hosted by the Missouri Botanical Garden.

MFCs would be developed using high surface-area graphite brush anodes and tubular cathodes, and modules of the MFCs would be inserted into tank reactors that continuously treat wastewater. Calculations by the investigator indicate that such MFCs linked with anaerobic digestion could recover 54% of the energy in a wastewater treatment plant and could save an additional 4% by not using aeration. This project will focus on several technical issues related to the improvement of efficiency and scale-up issues for MFC-based wastewater treatment, including optimization of brush anode loading. Experiments will be done to reduce anode specific surface areas from 9,600 m2/m3 (brush volume) to 500 m2/m3 to determine the point at which anode surface area limits power generation. Chemical treatment of graphite fibers will be tested to determine whether that enhances their efficiency for power generation and reduces acclimation times. In addition, tubular cathode materials will be examined in terms of their internal resistance, and a range of ion exchange materials (both cation and anion) will be tested for performance. The societal impacts of the research are potentially highly significant. If MFC-based wastewater treatment plants could be developed, they would save considerable amounts of energy. Such plants may be well suited for on-site or distributed treatment of wastewater, which has other potential environmental benefits. The project will support the training of two graduate students.

In the past, computer scientists and sociologists have analyzed these aspects in isolation, while sociolinguists and linguistic anthropologists have elaborated qualitative joint models. The ever-increasing flow of electronic communication offers new opportunities to analyze and quantitatively model these aspects of communication.<br/><br/>The project uses the Enron email corpus as a testbed for the development of computational joint models of these three aspects of communication, focusing on linguistic features (such as topic, genre, and speech act) and topological abstractions (such as subgroup analysis) that can be reliably and automatically analyzed in electronic communication. The work is being evaluated via concrete prediction tasks, such as the prediction of a person's organizational role based on the topology and linguistic content of their communication, and the prediction of how likely two people are to communicate in the future based on a limited sample of their communications.<br/><br/>The work is expected to have various potential applications, both for the general public, in the form of improved human-computer interaction for email clients and software that accesses email, and for the law enforcement and intelligence communities, in the development of automated techniques for discovering leadership and predicting communicative behavior.

The long term goal of the proposed work is to replicate the impact of local, on-campus programs targeting increased college preparedness and college success of minority and low income students, such as the well known Treisman Berkeley Professional Development Program, in a freely available, on-line learning environment. Making what would normally be a staff intensive program available ubiquitously at a dramatically reduced expense would be an enormous payoff. The proposed solution is to develop a technological augmentation to available human support in a lightly staffed environment. This proposed project brings together a team with expertise in both technological development and careful experimentation both in the lab and in the classroom, a track record for large scale deployment of educational materials, a solid foundation in significant results from prior work which builds on research in the areas of computer supported collaborative learning and tutorial dialogue systems. The broader impact of this project lies in the promise of accessibility to high quality educational resources for everyone.

Although thousands of families in Amazon floodplain communities participate in poorly understood timber production systems with a seemingly high potential for sustainability, there are relatively few studies that evaluate the sustainability of these small scale operations. This Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement project will evaluate the sustainability of timber management in the Amazon Estuary through the development and testing of a watershed model for the Mazagao River. Watershed models have proven useful for the integrative analysis of ecological and socio-economic processes that influence landscape dynamics, but they have not been employed to address questions related to the sustainability of tropical forest management. The proposed model will be used to address the following questions: (1) How much timber can be produced from naturally regenerated floodplain forests on a sustainable basis given the ecology of the timber species, the size and availability of management areas, and the economics of timber production? (2) How will potential changes in forest management, markets for timber and non-timber forest products, and in enforcement of environmental regulations alter future scenarios of timber availability and use in the watershed? In order to address these questions, the doctoral candidate will develop and test a model. The student will examine landscape characterization of the Mazagao River watershed by employing high-resolution satellite data and object-based classification methods to quantify the extent and spatial distribution of areas appropriate for forest management. He will incorporate population modeling of commercial timber species by adapting matrix models constructed from permanent inventory data to determine sustained yield estimates, and he will refine economic modeling of watershed timber production by employing collaborative monitoring methods of timber-related activities along with field observations to develop a production model that evaluates costs, benefits and economic limitations of timber management in the watershed.<br/><br/>A major challenge in Amazonia today is finding sustainable land uses that conserve forest cover and alleviate rural poverty. The issue of sustainable forest management viability, including community and smallholder forest management, has received substantial academic attention due to its clear relevance to both of these goals. Each of the three modeling components to be developed by the doctoral candidate will address a substantive gap in existing knowledge. By filling these gaps, the student will enhance basic theoretical understandings and will facilitate the analyses of the sustainability of land use practices in the Amazon estuary. As a whole, the model results will be useful for the evaluation of current and future scenarios of timber use while providing insights into the main factors limiting sustainable timber use in the Amazon estuary. The project will provide internships to local students at a rural school and will strengthen collaboration with Brazilian government agencies and NGOs to facilitate the return of research results to local stakeholders. As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career. This award is jointly supported by NSF's Office of International Science and Engineering.

The primary goal of this project is to positively impact the number of students with learning disabilities who succeed in STEM courses and careers by making universally designed teaching and learning resources available to college algebra instructors and their students at public community colleges and two-year private colleges. The primary hypothesis being investigated in this study is that students with learning disabilities who use universally designed algebra learning resources combined with teaching techniques and learning strategies will have higher algebra test scores and will report greater confidence in their math ability when compared to students who are not provided these resources, techniques and strategies. This project builds on the successful work being conducted by the PI, funded by the US Education Department (P333A050035), to implement a best practices professional development program for teaching students with learning disabilities in a community college setting.<br/><br/>This team from Landmark College, which is lead by a research psychologist, includes an expert in post-secondary mathematics education for students with learning disabilities and a team member with expertise in post-secondary learning strategies for students with disabilities and the use of assistive technologies for accessible college learning. The proposal includes a quasi-experimental design to compare the math performance of students assigned to the intervention and control groups on pre- and post-unit algebra content. 200 subjects are being recruited to participate in this study from four two-year post-secondary institutions: Landmark College, Berkshire Community College, Holyoke Community College and Suffolk Community College.<br/><br/>The project directly addresses the DEI track goals by making the learning resources accessible and available, by enriching students with learning disabilities' academic experiences in post-secondary algebra courses, and by demonstrating the effectiveness of mathematics intervention with public community college and private two-year college students with learning disabilities. There is a formative and summative project evaluation plan which is conducted by an external evaluator from the University of Massachusetts' Donahue Institute. Additional formative project input is provided by a team of expert advisors who include experts in either mathematics education or in disability services for students at two-year colleges: Kris Kozuch from Springfield Technical Community College; Cathy Jenner and DeEtta Ryan from Renton Technical College; John Reno and Clen Vance from Houston Community College; and Marianne DiMascio, John Devino and Christopher Mason from the Community College of Vermont. There is also a dissemination plan which includes sharing information with the RDE community via existing collaborations with two (2) of the RDE-funded Regional Alliances for Students with Disabilities in STEM Education: the University of Washington's AccessSTEM Alliance and The University of Southern Maine's EAST Alliance. Additional dissemination efforts include publishing in peer-reviewed professional journals and presenting information at annual usability conferences held in the northeast.

Symbionts can affect the tolerances of hosts to environmental factors such as heat, parasites or nutritional stress. In many cases, symbionts are transferred from mother to offspring before birth, with maternal transmission especially common in insects. This project focuses on mutations affecting symbiont genomes and on how these mutations impact the functioning and environmental tolerances of hosts. Full genome resequencing will be carried out for Buchnera, the bacterial symbionts of aphids and one of the best studied examples of symbiosis. These data will reveal the overall frequency of mutations in the symbiont genome and the frequency of mutations that affect functions important to hosts, such as production of essential nutrients or tolerance to heat. To quantify the effects of these mutations on hosts, lab experiments with live insects containing different symbiont genotypes will be conducted. Preliminary evidence indicates that even a single change in the symbiont DNA sequence can have a massive effect on the aphid's ability to survive heat exposure. The new results will show the extent of such mutations across the entire symbiont genome. <br/><br/>The results will add to understanding of fundamental processes determining the distribution of a major group of crop pests (aphids) and will have implications for similar symbiotic systems found in many other insect pests. The study has direct implications for predicting how organisms respond to climate change. Educational components, from the high school to graduate level, are integrated into the research. Graduate and undergraduate students will conduct significant portions of the primary research. In addition, high school students will participate through a sustained collaboration between the main investigator and a biology teacher at a large urban high school with a majority of students from groups underrepresented in science and in the university.

There is potential to substantially improve the energy efficiency of sensor networks by exploiting cross-layer interactions among various networking layers and functionalities. However, such a cross-layer solution could also become impractically complex and difficult to implement. To address this challenge, this collaborative NSF-funded project at The Ohio State University and Purdue University aims to develop a suite of high-performance cross-layer mechanisms for sensor networks that are simple, modular, distributed, and provably energy-efficient. The key distinguishing feature of the project is that the mechanisms developed are based on a solid theoretical foundation that rigorously manages both performance and complexity with the goal of practical implementation. The PIs will investigate four major functionalities that are crucial to the efficient operation of energy-constrained wireless sensor networks, including joint medium-access and routing, sleep/wake scheduling, in-network aggregation/computation, and reliable broadcast. The theoretical solutions developed in this project will be implemented and evaluated on two testbeds: the existing Kansei testbed at OSU, and a prototype deployment (SENSE@OSU).<br/><br/>Broader impact: The collaborative research will have a significant impact on wireless industry sectors, and will lead to breakthroughs in our understanding of the fundamental limits for developing energy-efficient distributed solutions for sensor networks. The PIs will also continue their current efforts to recruit and train women and under-represented minority groups both at the undergraduate and graduate levels.

The end effector will be able to sense a micro contact force at an unprecedented accuracy and dynamic range, and to on-line regulate the both micro contact force and position. This research will provide a solution for the long outstanding problem in micro force sensing, i.e. solving the conflict between the sensitivity and dynamic range. The approach is based on measuring the rate of the micro force instead of directly measuring the force itself, and obtaining the force information via real-time data processing. As a result, highly accurate force measurements can be obtained without imposing any limitation on the dynamic range of the sensor. This research will also provide the theoretical foundation and implementation scheme for the application of the infinite dimensional system theory to the hybrid force/position control in micromanipulation. The results of this project will lead to the development of an efficient and effective micro robotic manipulation system for the automation in the assembly of micro sensors, actuators and other devices, and micro injection and manipulation in biomedical research and applications.

One challenge is to obtain an accurate overview of a large text collection, such as the public comments collected in ''''''''notice and comment'''''''' rulemaking. No single tool currently provides a sufficiently diversified picture of such a corpus, and no adequate theory exists to help people explore and form a deep and nuanced understanding of such a text collection. This research seeks to develop a computational framework that allows further exploration of this problem from multiple, integrated perspectives. All the assembled perspectives will be brought together into a single overall supra-document structure that is dynamically constructed under user guidance. In this structure, hierarchical topic clusters will be cross-linked by opinion and argumentation links, using two classes of text analysis engines: one for topics and subtopics, and the other for argument structures. The research team will design, develop, build, and systematically test an overall text exploration framework, an application to support federal regulation writersone called the Rule-Writers Workbench. There is a strong collaboration with Federal government officials who will provide data and participate in user testing. The three PIs have successfully collaborated on a related project under previous NSF funding. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: This is a sustainable collaboration between computer science and political/social science research, rooted in a challenging and important real world application and informed by years of end user research. Dynamic, user-driven subtopic definition and clustering algorithms coupled with<br/>language modeling are an innovative yet reachable set of goals. The framework to be developed will be grounded in the humanities disciplines'' expertise in rhetoric, discourse structure, and subjectivity.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The Rule-Writers Workbench will allow federal government regulation writers to employ a suite of technical tools that perform independent analyses of public responses to proposed regulations, including near-duplicate detection and clustering, user-based topic selection from dynamically extracted keywords, opinion identification, and subtopic clustering. These capabilities will open new avenues for federal comment analysis.

Recent studies suggest remarkably rapid benthic nitrate consumption in the Santa Barbara Basin (Sigman et al., 2003; Hammond et al., 2006). Yet, budgets for N, S and C fluxes in this basin may be only satisfied if a large fraction (up 100 % potentially) of nitrate uptake in SBB sediments does not involve the respiration of organic carbon, but instead is coupled to oxidation of sulfides. The bacteria Thioploca and Beggiatoa, found in this region, are known to accumulate up to 500 mM of nitrate intracellularly. They transport nitrate into the sediments, up to depths of tens of centimeters where nitrate is used for hydrogen sulfide oxidation. This non-local nitrate transport (within laminated sediments) clearly ?breaks? the rules of diagenetic sequence. Preliminary work in SBB and Santa Monica and San Pedro Basins produced geochemical and isotopic evidence which is consistent with bacterial transport and subsequent transformation of nitrate to dinitrogen (N2) at depth in the sediments.<br/><br/>The researchers on this project hypothesize that non-local bacterial transport of nitrate may be a significant but previously overlooked sink in the regional and global N budgets of oxygen deficient zones. They will (1) examine the geochemical framework favorable for non-local bacterial transport of nitrate; (2) determine the relative contribution of this process to net regional losses of fixed N; (3) identify and quantify the effects of this phenomenon on the ‰15N of nitrate in the overlying water column; and (4) investigate the possible coupling of microbial nitrate transport to other reactions that reduce nitrate, such as Anammox.<br/><br/>This project, which includes one long cruise and four brief cruises to San Pedro Basin, will provide a framework for potential involvement of USC and Princeton undergraduate and graduate students in oceanographic research. The tell-tale signs of nitrate-transporting bacteria have been and will continue to be a topic of interest in the ongoing International Geobiology summer course on nearby Catalina Island. Finally, this project will support the scientific development of a young female researcher who spear-head this proposal.

With the goals of improving the reproducibility and consistency of the research and expanding access to the data, FLOSSmole collects, organizes, and shares comparable data and analyses of FLOSS development. A framework for organizing a system for facilitating access to the massive amounts of data collected by many simultaneous and currently unconnected FLOSS research efforts, FLOSSmole is designed to be a piece of research infrastructure. Because FLOSS development provides examples of successful computer-supported collaborative work, the project is relevant to various areas of research such as Human-Centered Computing and Cyberinfrastructure. It enables cooperation in data collection, aggregation and sharing. Furthermore, serving as a potential training ground for software developers, its development should teach us about software evolution and the understanding of how developers join and work in these teams.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: Supporting improvement of a piece of collaborative research used by academics, practitioners in the software industry, and by society in general, the infrastructure promotes international collaboration and data sharing among research teams. Indeed, sharing code, data, schemas, queries, and experience promotes teaching and learning. The project should benefit students who work on it impacting courses and projects. Moreover, as an open source project itself the resource contributes to open and share data promoting collaboration, reducing duplicative efforts, and promoting compatibility between research teams.

Moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces, and their symmetries, the mapping class groups, are fundamental objects of interest in many branches of mathematics. Recently, techniques from coarse geometry have been applied to these spaces, and using these results Joseph Maher has shown that a random walk on the mapping class group gives rise to a pseudo-Anosov element with asymptotic probability one. This project involves extending this to obtain further information about the mapping class group, for example, investigating whether random walks on this group make linear progress in the complex of curves. Such results may have applications to the study of 3-manifolds, as every 3-manifold has a Heegaard splitting, determined by a gluing map, which is an element of the mapping class group. One aim of this project is to show that the volume of the resulting manifold grows linearly with the length of the random walk. Other goals of this project include attempting to extend the results for random walks to other counting problems, both in the mapping class group and in Teichmuller space, and to more general classes of weakly relatively hyperbolic groups.<br/><br/><br/>The space of all possible shapes a surface may have, called the moduli space of the surface, is a fundamental object of interest in many parts of mathematics, and its structure is closely related to its symmetries, which are described by the mapping class group. These objects have applications in physics, for example in attempting to build models of quantum gravity in 2+1 dimensions, known as topological quantum field theories (TQFTs). <br/>The moduli spaces of surfaces also play an important role in certain conformal field theories and string theories. The study of surfaces and the mapping class group is also useful in the study of three- and four-dimensional spaces, which are important, as they are spaces which are locally modelled on the visible dimensions of the universe in which we live, which has three spatial dimensions, plus one time dimension.

The engineered vessels will be derived by seeding cells on a porous biodegradable scaffold. In addition, the role of the scaffold mechanical properties on the adaptation of the engineered vessel will also be characterized. The research objectives are to develop a mathematical model to describe how tissue engineered blood vessels adapt in response to mechanical loading and perform experiments to test this model. The model and experimental data will be used to optimize the design of tissue engineered blood vessels with the ultimate goal of designing a graft suitable for coronary by-pass surgery. <br/>Over half a million coronary by-pass procedures are performed in the United States each year. Often veins or arteries from other locations in the patients body are used to 'by-pass' clogged arteries; long-term complication rates for these procedures, however, remain at 30-50% and many patients lack adequate grafting vessels. Tissue engineered blood vessels offer promise towards providing a suitable coronary by-pass graft; however, to date strategies for developing a small diameter graft with adequate strength and resistance to blood clotting remains elusive. This work will support undergraduate and graduate students to conduct research. Emphasis will be given to minority students in the dual degree 'Partners in Transitioning to Tech' program between the Georgia Tech and several historically black colleges in Atlanta.

Warchall	07/31/2011	$135,576.00		antipov@math.lsu.edu	202 Himes Hall	Baton Rouge	LA	708032701	2255782760	MPS	1266	0000, 9150, OTHR	$0.00	The proposed research is closely related to contemporary trends in fluid mechanics and computational complex analysis, focusing on mathematical modeling of supercavitating flow around hydrofoils in free boundary domains. The central idea is the use of Riemann surfaces for the modeling of physical flow in the rear part of a cavity and for the solution of the governing boundary-value problems. The technique requires the development and implementation of diverse modern tools of pure and applied mathematics, namely, the conformal mapping method, the Schwarz reflection principle, the theory of symmetric Schottky groups, and the theory of the Riemann-Hilbert boundary-value problem on Riemann surfaces and for symmetric automorphic functions.<br/><br/>Hydrodynamic cavitation is defined as the breakdown of a liquid under low pressure. Cavitation causes wall erosion, alters hydrofoil performance (reduces lift and increases drag of a hydrofoil for example) and produces noise and vibration. Cavitation has long been of interest not only in the field of shipbuilding and hydraulic machinery, but also because of its positive effects in chemical processing (electrolytic deposition and the production of emulsions), physics (dispersion of particles in a fluid) and medicine (bacteria destruction from the surfaces of equipment, therapeutic massage and potential bioeffects of ultrasound caused by acoustic cavitation in blood vessels). The overall goal of this project is to develop a unified mathematical approach for free boundary problems in multiply-connected domains in order to solve non-linear model problems of supercavitating flow around a stack of hydrofoils. These solutions will help obtain an understanding of the mechanism of flow in the rear parts of cavities, of how the cavities interact with each other, and of how the lift, drag and the cavity configuration depend on the proximity of the walls and the free surfaces.

However, in the case of hurricane evacuation, normally positive factors of community strength (social capital, social cohesion, and large social networks) may paradoxically provide incentives for certain persons to avoid following evacuation orders issued by authorities. In particular, long-term residents, defined as those living in the community for more than 10 years, fail to follow evacuation orders at a higher rate than other groups. Peer pressure, perceived obligations to family, friends, and community organizations, and membership in a very close-knit social group that has weathered many previous storms all may play a role in this failure of long-term residents to evacuate.<br/><br/>Past research has primarily looked at demographic and socio-economic factors, such as age, income, level of education, composition of household, and race or ethnicity to understand the hurricane evacuation decision. This study will take a different approach and look at social factors that contribute to community bonding. Data sources will include information about volunteerism, involvement in local civic organizations, neighborhood solidarity and trust, location and numbers of family members and friends, perception of local government and other factors that may quantify social causes for evacuation failure. If it is indeed their strong social ties, generally seen as a public good, that lead to long-term residents' failure to evacuate, the identification of new interventions that could increase evacuation among this group has broad potential impact for public health and safety. <br/>

However, current electronic commerce applications such as online auction systems are not trustworthy due to a lack of effective trust management mechanisms. A trustworthy online auction system requires a dynamic trust management system that can detect abnormal bidding activities in real-time, notify the involved users, and cancel the corresponding auction immediately.<br/><br/>This project investigates an agent-based approach for dynamic trust management in online auctions. The approach supports real-time monitoring, analyzing, and detection of abnormal bidding behaviors in online auction systems so the trustworthiness of such systems can be ensured. Specific problems to be addressed in this project include 1) investigating efficient formal methods, such as model checking techniques, for analysis of real-time auction data; 2) defining a real-time trust model that supports trust re-evaluation; and 3) formulating intelligent agents that support reasoning with uncertainty and incomplete information. The research activities will result in a loosely coupled agent-based trust management (ATM) module in online auction systems. The project will have favorable broader impacts on trustworthy computing research, education, as well as industrial applications. The results from this project can help to develop trustworthy systems in electronic commerce, and will contribute to boost the US economy by providing a safe and trusted environment for Internet-based trading.

Since it is difficult to isolate pure glycoproteins from biomaterials, an alternative approach is to generate these compounds by chemical synthesis. This requires the synthesis of (glyco)peptide thioesters and (glyco)peptides, which are used as building blocks. The P.I.'s research focuses on the development of a unique photochemical method, which can be used to synthesize the desired components under mild reaction conditions. The building blocks are then reacted with each other, which will produce large glycopeptides.<br/><br/>The proposed research will be conducted by students at the University of Texas at El Paso, a recognized Hispanic Serving Institution. The students will obtain expertise in modern carbohydrate and peptide chemistry. Some of the research will be done in collaboration with an outstanding Japanese group, which will contribute to a competitive and invigorating learning environment for the P.I.'s students. Due to the cross-disciplinary nature of the project, the anticipated results will have an impact on the science community well beyond organic chemistry.

These plants are best known as the source of tropical passionfruit, but are also widely cultivated for their beautiful, complex flowers. Passionflowers appear to be a recently-evolved lineage that has experienced rapid species diversification. Many species are poorly understood with regard to morphology, geographical distribution, and conservation status, especially in the largest lineage of passionflowers, subgenus Decaloba, with 235+ species. This study will synthesize modern and traditional approaches to address these problems, using DNA sequence data, scanning electron microscopy, and observation of fresh and preserved specimens. Field work will enable collection of fresh material and documentation of species distributions. This project will yield a revision of all species in Decaloba, and will provide a modern evolutionary framework within which to address questions about the evolution of floral shape, pollination syndromes, floral development, and the biogeographical history of the lineage. <br/><br/>This study will address important biological and evolutionary questions in an especially charismatic group of plants. Undergraduate and graduate students will participate in the research. Undergraduates at Keene State College and Harris-Stowe State University, institutions that primarily enroll underrepresented groups in the sciences, will especially benefit from involvement in this study. Summer workshops at Rancho Santa Ana Botanic Garden will involve students from the local community. Field expeditions will build international collaborations among U.S. scientists and colleagues in Mexico, Central America, and South America. All results of this project will be available through a website hosted by the Missouri Botanical Garden.

These planets, which are made mainly of hydrogen and helium, must have accreted this gas before the solar nebula dispersed. Observations of young star systems suggest that gas disks have lifetimes of 1 to 10 million years. So, the gas giant planets had to have formed before this time. The leading theory for the formation of Jupiter and Saturn is the so-called core accretion<br/>model. In this model a large planetary embryo formed first, mainly by two-body accretion. This is then followed by a period of inflow of nebular gas directly onto the growing planet. The accretion of a massive atmosphere requires a solid core of ~10 Earth mass. Assembling such a large body before the nebula disappears, it turns out, offers some serious challenges to the theory of planet formation as it currently stands. In the last five years or so, there has been a concerted effort by the planet formation community to overcome these problems. Indeed, several new ideas have been presented in the literature. However, many of these ideas have yet to be fully explored with modern dynamical simulations. <br/><br/>Dr. Harold Levison and colleagues will construct the most comprehensive model of core accretion to date using state-of-the-art N-body numerical methods. In particular, they will perform a series of simulations that study the evolution of a system of planetary embryos and planetesimals embedded in the solar nebula. In the long run, the models will include: i) the direct gravitational interaction of the planetesimals and embryos, ii) aerodynamic drag on the planetesimals, iii) Type I migration of the embryos, iv) fragmentation, v) the effects of embryos' atmospheres, vi) the buildup of solids at the so-called snow-line, and vii) turbulence-driven migration of the embryos. They will begin with relatively simple calculations and increase the complexity as the research program progresses. Such exhaustive modeling should allow solution of the critical problem of the formation of Jupiter and Saturn, or prove that a more creative solution is needed. <br/><br/>Solving the problem of the formation of Jupiter and Saturn will have important scientific implications for researchers in a broad range of disciplines for two reasons. First, for those interested in the Solar System, Jupiter, and to a lesser extent Saturn, has controlled the dynamical evolution of the entire system. Thus, this research is relevant to such issues as the evolution of the asteroid belt, the formation of the Oort cloud, delivery of water to the Earth, the formation of Uranus and Neptune, and the sculpting of the Kuiper belt. In addition, Jupiter and Saturn are probably similar to the roughly 200 extrasolar planets thus far discovered. Therefore, understanding the formation of our two home-grown gas giants will profoundly affect our understanding of their distant cousins. During the course of this research, the team will openly disseminate the results through conference presentations and publications in refereed journals. Dr. Levison puts all his presentations on the Web. This resource has been used by professional astronomers, educators, and the news media as a source of information on the origin of the Solar System, as well as, a source of<br/>graphics and animations. He frequently participates in educational and public outreach projects,<br/>included television and radio appearances. <br/>***

Types provide the foundation for the composition of systems from independently reusable components by providing a rich language of invariants governing programs and data. Verification provides the foundation for reasoning about the run-time behavior of programs, especially their effect on the execution environment.<br/><br/>To integrate these two methods the project is developing new dependent type systems capable of expressing behavioral specifications and new methods for checking conformance with such rich type constraints. To ensure that the integration is sound, the project is developing its theoretical foundations using mechanized proof assistants. To assess the practicality of the integration, the project is implementing a programming language that integrates types and verification, and is developing applications that illustrate its use.<br/><br/>The primary intellectual contribution of the project is to investigate the design and implementation of programming languages that support the specification and verification of strong correctness properties of programs. A broader contribution of the project is to promote through education the use of formal methods to improve the reliability and maintainability of software systems.

They possess highly efficient and complicated mechanisms for filtering the water around them, and capturing and sorting particles therein. Their feeding processes strongly couple water-column and bottom communities, and thus they can influence the general well-being of other organisms as well as the overall environment. Because these organisms play such a key role in ecosystems, it is important to understand how they process particulate matter, sorting food from non-food particles, and what factors control the process. <br/><br/>In this research, scientists from two universities will use their previously developed techniques of feeding physiology and biochemistry to address, for the first time, the bases of selection at the cell and organ level to address long-standing questions regarding the mechanism(s) by which bivalves and other suspension feeders accomplish particle selection. At the core of this research are two fundamental questions: 1) Is particle selection an active process, i.e., based on chemically mediated behavior, or a passive process, i.e., based on interactions between particles and mucus-coated feeding structures?; and 2) Do different groups of suspension-feeding molluscs, employ the same or different mechanisms for particle discrimination? Results from this research will provide a better understanding of feeding processes in different species of bivalves, the potential impact of bivalves on coastal environments, and how environmental perturbations (e.g., pollution) might affect particle feeding. Results will be relevant to ecosystem health and shellfish restoration. <br/><br/>The study links government and university scientists, and enhances cross-fertilization of ideas and techniques. Broader impacts of the work will include training of graduate and undergraduate students who will be involved in various aspects of the research and will participate in scientific conferences. Results will be disseminated through scientific literature, conferences, and articles for non-specialists. Working with K-12 educators, the researchers will develop age-appropriate educational packets that will demonstrate fundamental biological principles of an ecologically and economically important group of marine animals in understandable, real-world terms.

Understanding the origin, patterns of variation, and relationships among angiosperms is challenging. Despite progress, relationships among major groups remain unclear, as do relationships within major subgroups (e.g., roses and allies). Our multigene and genomics approaches target 12 problematic groups and subgroups; their resolution should clarify the framework for angiosperm phylogeny. We also will develop the first comprehensive non-DNA database for angiosperms and populate it with key morphological features. Together, our approaches will lay groundwork for collaboratively building the tree of all 12,000 genera of angiosperms. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The angiosperm tree will be useful to comparative biologists including physiologists, ecologists, paleobiologists, and genomicists. The Botany Browser we develop will provide an informatics infrastructure to bring many data resources to users' desktops. The Angiosperm MorphBank will facilitate group diagnosis, analyses of character distributions, and study of fossils. Our interdisciplinary training of postdoctoral fellows and students will emphasize recruitment of minorities. Our website on angiosperm diversity will be valuable to researchers, K-12 teachers, and students. We will construct pages for the Tree of Life Web Project including TreeHouses designed for K-12 students and teachers. A movable museum exhibit highlighting advances in our understanding of plant phylogeny will be distributed to museums represented in our project. Posters detailing the angiosperm tree will be designed and distributed and made available on CD. Additional outreach will be provided through presentations to local public schools.

To investigate why electoral competition sometimes leads to ethnic polarization, this project focuses on the role that political parties and candidates play in politicizing ethnic cleavages.  It seeks to understand why some parties exploit such cleavages to mobilize supporters while others downplay them.  The project examines how variation in demographic and political factors affects campaign strategy.  Empirically, the project collects data on campaign messages employed by presidential and parliamentary candidates in Kenya.  The resulting dataset will be used to examine the factors that encourage or discourage divisive ethnic appeals.  By focusing on sub-national variation within one country, the project holds institutional factors constant, making it possible to examine how demographic and political factors affect campaign decisions.  It also goes beyond current studies by collecting detailed data on the content of campaign messages employed by a large number of candidates.  The project opens further avenues for innovative research by creating a unique dataset that will be made available to other researchers and collaborators.  Through collaboration with the University of Nairobi, it creates opportunities for the participation of underrepresented groups.  Finally, by investigating the factors that affect campaign strategy, this project contributes to efforts to encourage moderation and stability in ethnically divided societies.

The methods and techniques will be combined into the remote-access SNe Ia computational pipeline, which comprises sophisticated 3D simulation algorithms for fluid dynamics, nucleosynthesis, and radiation transport, as well as tools for the 3D analysis of SNe Ia data. SNe Ia are crucial for identifying the nature of dark energy, one of the most important problems facing modern science, because they serve as one of the most direct and precise distance indicators in the Universe. The results of this study will improve the cosmological calibration of these critical tools, by trying to understand what affects their status as standard candles, notably the different types of progenitor systems, deviations from spherical symmetry, and interaction with circumstellar matter. One important outcome will be a comprehensive set of observationally verified first-principles multidimensional explosion models of SNe Ia. Identifying physical correlations among predicted and observed signatures of SNe Ia will be crucial for improving the accuracy of their calibration.<br/><br/>This work is an exceptional platform for introducing students to cross-disciplinary and multi-field science, through the many areas involved in studying SNe Ia, such as numerical methods, large-scale hydrodynamics and radiation transport simulations, observations, and cosmological applications. Research results will be made available to the broad scientific community via the developed computational pipeline, and will be disseminated to the wider non-technical audience. The results will also benefit current and future ground- and space-based observing programs.

The goal of the project is to establish a new method for modeling cultural differentiation and transformation using textual data drawn from the published abstracts of a major science citation index. Using a computational procedure called Latent Semantic Analysis, the meaning of science articles' abstracts will be quantitatively represented, allowing their semantic similarity to other articles in the index to be analyzed and graphically illustrated using multi-dimensional scaling. Doing so will allow scientific fields to be evaluated as discrete cultural groups within science on the basis of their latent semantic similarities. The result will be a schematic illustration of the structure of science on the basis of actual scientific work produced. Analyses based on this procedure will then be able to delineate the structure and overlap of the sciences. <br/><br/>Intellectual merit. In addition to the valuable insight into the differentiated structure of science that this approach will afford, the project's intellectual merit stems from the answers it promises to longstanding questions in the area of cultural transmission as exemplified by scientific citation. In particular, it will use variables derived from the Latent Semantic Analysis to test the fundamental tenets of Evolutionary Culture Theory, a promising multi-disciplinary movement whose development has been impeded by a lack of concrete research. This paucity has stemmed not from lack of interest in the theory but rather a vexing yet inexorable problem with operationalizing it--namely the difficulty in finding suitable units of analysis and analytical tool. The proposal represents one solution to these problems derived from the culmination of a long line of thinking about scientific progress in terms of evolutionary mechanisms and population biology. In doing so, it will test the hypothesis that cultural transmission is an evolutionary process amenable to a population thinking approach; and reveal the degree to which scientific success is a function of population variables describing the density and diversity of semantic space occupied by articles and their paradigmatic themes. Because the approach can be integrated into current network citation research and is extensible to other domains and fields, it has the potential to evolve into a distributed, progressive research program.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts. With regard to the broader impacts of the project, there are two notable practical applications of the proposed research. First, representing science as a differentiated cultural system can help inform university and grant administrators by revealing the latent semantic structure of scientific space. At present, scientific work is categorized explicitly and funded on the basis of assumptions regarding the distribution of scientific research--assumptions that may be erroneous or outdated. Using Latent Semantic Analysis to examine the actual distribution of scientific resources on the basis of semantic content can overcome these limitations and allow administrators to properly allocate scientific resources and structure academic programs. Second, it can also aid multi-disciplinary research by offering the prototype for a semantic search capability, overcoming current limitations in scientific document searches, which search on the basis of the lexical terms; using Latent Semantic Analysis would enable searching on the basis of semantics, regardless of a lexical match. This will be especially useful to scientists working in multi-disciplinary areas, where terminological differences across fields may impede access to information, but it can also increase the public's access to information by lowering terminological specificity needed to find scientific documents.

Several questions will be addressed:<br/>1. What are the net effects of continental-slope internal-wave-driven boundary mixing on the<br/>interior stratification of the ocean?<br/>2. Do finescale parameterizations for turbulent mixing fall short by a factor of 5 6 in canyons because of (i) a more coherent internal wave field than found in the open ocean or (ii) interactions with topography?<br/>Measurements will include full-depth velocity-temperature profile surveys with XCPs, time series<br/>of currents and water properties with transmissometer-equipped LADCP/CTD, time-series of turbulent mixing with a microstructure profiler, and a velocity and temperature profile time series of the bottom 120 m with a mooring equipped with ADCP and thermistor chain. These data will be used (i) to quantify the BBL energy budget by determining internal wave energy fluxes into and out of the boundary along with boundary-layer turbulent dissipation rates, and (ii) to characterize the distribution of nepheloid layers. Energy-flux divergence will be used to identify internal wave sources and sinks within the canyon while potential external sources will be identified from deep-water fluxes. In addition, new analysis techniques will be explored, including (i) the use of energy-flux co-spectra to diagnose internal wave reflection from the near-critical bottom slope, (ii) bi-coherence to evaluate relationships between high and low vertical wavenumbers, (iii) momentum-fluxes to evaluate bottom form drag, and (iv) stratification flux and sediment flux to determine the exchange of mixed boundary water with the stratified interior. This work is in collaboration with Eric Kunze at the University of Victoria, who will make the microstructure measurements and participate in analysis and interpretation of the whole data set. It will benefit from recent modeling efforts and measurements on the slope south of Monterey Bay during ONR's 2006 AESOP program.<br/>Intellectual Merit: We are motivated by fundamental questions concerning (i) the exchange of fluid mixed on the boundary with that in the stratified interior and its role in global mixing and the thermohaline circulation, and (ii) how to better parameterize internal-wave-driven turbulent mixing near topography. The survey plan combines spatial coverage and high-frequency timeseries to allow rigorous testing of significance. The core XCP pattern spanning a full cycle of the semidiurnal tide will provide better resolution of a coherent internal wavefield in space and time than hitherto achieved outside the laboratory in order to better understand the cascade of energy through the internal wave field near sloping topography. In addition, exploratory measurements in other continental slope canyons will aid in expanding applicability to a global scope.<br/>Broader Impacts: The multi-institutional collaboration will advance interdisciplinary understanding of mixing processes in Monterey Canyon and other continental slope canyons, an important facet for local budgets of nutrients, sediment, and chemical tracers. Through the refinement of finescale mixing parameterizations, it will also aid large-scale mixing budgets and,<br/>potentially, climate model predictions. Education will be advanced through the support of graduate students and participation in outreach activities.

A key additional requirement for real-time embedded systems is predictable timing behavior of software components, which requires that bounds on the worst-case execution time (WCET) of embedded software be determined. While static timing analysis yields verifiable bounds on the WCET, it cannot keep pace with architectural innovations and hardware performance variation due to chip fabrication scaling. <br/><br/>This work contributes a fundamentally new approach to bounding the WCET with three major contributions: (1) Instead of simulating execution, actual execution in hardware is promoted to assess the WCET of a task. This approach not only renders tedious hardware modeling unnecessary but also confirms correct behavior regardless of architectural complexity or hardware variation. (2) The approach and its complexity are evaluated by FPGA synthesis. This assesses the feasibility of the design and validates a prototype implementation. (3) The impact of advanced architectural features is studied in a co-design space exploration, aimed to provide predictability and tight WCET bounds. The research conducted in this project advances existing science and technology through novel techniques in hardware and software design for safety-critical embedded real-time systems by providing high-confidence bounds on execution times; enhancing hardware architectures with support to assess execution times; and customizing hardware features via co-design to improve predictability. These capabilities directly benefit safety and reliability of software controlling, for example, aircraft and components of cars, thereby aiding the high-confidence design of embedded systems.

McClure<br/><br/>The principal investigator plans to work in four quite different<br/>areas where homotopy-theoretic methods can be applied. The first<br/>area is string topology. This part of the project is joint with<br/>Ralph Kaufmann; Kaufmann and McClure will combine their previous<br/>work on string topology in order to obtain a lifting of string<br/>topology to the chain level for arbitrary genus. The second area<br/>is surgery spectra. This is joint with Gerd Laures; Laures and<br/>McClure will complete their proof that certain symmetric<br/>L-spectra have E-infinity ring structures and that the symmetric<br/>signature is an E-infinity ring map. They will also extend their<br/>work in order to show that a certain map from algebraic K-theory<br/>to symmetric L-theory defined by Weiss and Williams is an<br/>E-infinity ring map. The third area is intersection homology.<br/>This is joint with Greg Friedman and Scott Wilson; Friedman,<br/>McClure and Wilson will work to develop homotopy theoretic<br/>structure on intersection chains which should (for example) lead<br/>to the development of a rational homotopy theory of stratified<br/>spaces. The fourth area is C* algebras. This is joint with<br/>Marius Dadarlat; Dadarlat and McClure will work to show that the<br/>classical work of Dixmier and Douady on bundles whose fibre is<br/>the algebra of compact operators can be extended to bundles whose<br/>fibre is a Kirchberg algebra.<br/><br/>The original goal of homotopy theory was to develop methods which<br/>could be applied to geometric problems (including problems in<br/>dimensions higher than three). Since its origin in the early<br/>twentieth century, homotopy theory has developed into an<br/>autonomous discipline, but the connection with geometry has<br/>always been a central concern. Since about 1960, it has become<br/>apparent that homotopy theory has applications to other things<br/>besides geometry, for example to analysis, algebra, and more<br/>recently to physics. The work of the principal investigator and<br/>his coauthors is intended to take the latest developments in<br/>homotopy theory (for example, the theory of symmetric spectra)<br/>and apply them to other areas, including geometric problems (the<br/>classification of higher-dimensional shapes), and problems in<br/>mathematical physics (string topology is part of the program<br/>being carried on by many people to develop a clearer mathematical<br/>understanding of ideas from string theory).

Voluntary redirections of gaze occur several times per second from one scene location to the next. Even in the intervals between these redirections, when it seems that gaze is fixed at a single location, microscopic eye movements, known as fixational eye movements, continually jitter the stimulus with respect to the retina. Little is known about how the normal alternation of macroscopic and microscopic eye movements affects the retinal stimulus, and about the importance of this dynamic input for the visual system. <br/><br/>With support from the National Science Foundation, Dr. Michele Rucci will examine the influence of eye movements on the acquisition and encoding of visual information. Experiments with human observers will analyze and compare the characteristics of visual input signals to the retina during a number of everyday viewing activities. Computer models of neuronal populations in the early stages of the visual system will be used to investigate the hypothesis that a continually changing retinal stimulus contributes to the establishment of efficient visual representations. This project addresses fundamental questions in visual neuroscience. Pathological conditions which give rise to abnormal eye movements are typically accompanied by visual impairments. Understanding the impact of eye movements on early visual processing is critical to the advancement of knowledge of how the visual system functions in health and disease.

Specific equipment to be purchased includes: 1) a handheld frequency-domain electromagnetic system; 2) a time-domain, 10 channel resistivity/induced polarization system; and 3) upgrade of an existing ground penetrating radar (GPR) system to allow for simultaneous collection of data from two antennas operating at different frequencies (100 and 200 MHz). The equipment will allow for higher spatial resolution and time-series subsurface imaging of free phase gas (primarily bubble pockets of methane) in northern latitude peatlands. Research facilitated will support a better understanding of the temporal controls of carbon gas fluxes and estimation of reservoirs of ancient carbon pools in these systems that are could be released to the atmosphere as a consequence of global warming (a positive feedback resulting from anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. The instrumentation will support undergraduate and graduate student experiences with state-of the-art geophysical equipment at both Rutgers University-Newark and New Jersey City University (NJCU), both located in urban areas with high percentages of underrepresented students (NJCU is a Hispanic Serving Institution). The PIs plan to involve students in industry-impacted regional subsurface investigations.

This efficiency is also impacted by how photosynthesis and respiration interact through sharing of reactants and products. This project will examine the resistances to CO2 diffusion in leaves and interactions between photosynthesis and respiration through analyses of how leaves differentially use heavy and light isotopes of carbon in CO2, a task that has become easier, faster, and less expensive with the development of a new technology - the tunable diode laser spectrometer (TDL). Recent discoveries suggest that providing high light intensities to a leaf immediately preceding a dark period can have a large effect on the exchange of isotopes during darkness. This implies a larger role of the enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) than is expected and this could impact interpretation of isotopic data used to measure internal leaf resistance to CO2 diffusion and interactions between photosynthesis and respiration. Daily and seasonal variation in carbon isotope usage by woody and herbaceous species will be analyzed along with plants containing high amounts of PEPC. This study will help to define the role of PEPC in controlling isotopic usage by plants and its influence on photosynthetic and respiratory interactions.<br/><br/>Broader impacts: In addition to potential crop improvements, increases in understanding of isotopic exchange within leaves will refine the fundamental assumptions used to understand ecosystem metabolism and generate data needed to model regional carbon cycles. The TDL is straightforward and inexpensive to use making it ideal for classroom education and laboratory training of graduate and undergraduate students at the University of New Mexico (a Minority Serving Institution where 36% of UNM Biology's 1300 majors are Hispanic and another 7% are Native American) and at Portland State University (where many students are the first member of their family to attend college or are non-traditional re-entry students). Experience with this equipment will help prepare students for research careers at universities, national labs, and in the private sector.

Bergman	08/31/2008	$40,000.00		mueller@egr.msu.edu	Office of Sponsored Programs	East Lansing	MI	488242600	5173555040	ENG	1406	0000, 064E, 9237, OTHR	$0.00	Exploratory Investigation in Shockwave Generation by Flash Evaporation<br/>General<br/>The proposed research is an investigation of the generation of shock waves by flash evaporation. Flash evaporation occurs when a liquid is suddenly exposed to a pressure lower than its saturation pressure. Then some of the sensible heat must be transferred into latent heat of vaporization and a fierce and sudden process of vapor bubble formation occurs within the liquid while the temperature of the fluid decreases significantly. There have already been applications for flash evaporation, including water desalination, the depositing of thin layers of material and in vapor sterilization. Still shock wave processes induced by flash evaporation have not been much documented, hindering the exploitation for new technical applications. Extending this scientific knowledgebase will help to overcome this barrier. <br/>Although these phenomena can damage industrial equipment; these shock waves have been hypothesized as useful in creating compression. It has been predicted that condensation can follow the pressure rise, leading to a new phase change compression principle also applicable for thermodynamic cycles. The newly invented condensing wave rotor is an example for a technical application. Such novel technology can yield higher energy efficiency for refrigeration cycles, particularly in combination with the natural and benign refrigerant water (R718). Additionally, this knowledge may be applied to other refrigerant cycles, but also to fuel pumps and to pressure recovery devices for liquefied gases and more.<br/>To increase understanding flash-induced shock behavior, basic experimental investigations will be conducted to verify and extend an analytical model. To verify and investigate the generation and behavior of flash-driven shock waves in water vapor under vacuum, particularly the relationship between flash evaporation conditions and shock wave strength will be investigated through a controlled experiment. For this, a single-chamber test rig will be constructed in which pressure and temperature changes will be recorded with transducers and an infrared camera. The experiment shall verify and extend an analytical model previously generated by the PI's team. <br/>The Intellectual Merit of the Proposed Activity<br/>The main objective of the experiment is the verification, recording and investigation of flash evaporation induced shock waves under vacuum in water vapor for which there appears to be no accessible scientific documentation yet. Therefore, the results will extend the fundamental knowledgebase and will help to improve and validate the mathematical models which have been used to describe the dynamics of this compressible phase-change flow. Additionally, this experiment shall confirm that flash induced shock waves can generate pressure rises applicable for the condensation of water vapor at higher pressures. <br/>The Broader Impacts<br/>The understanding of the fluid behavior of flash evaporation induced shock wave processes is important to prevent disastrous effects of flash evaporation and for the development of industrial applications. A first technical application can be in the novel condensing wave rotor that uses the basic principles of flash evaporation and shock waves to increase the efficiency of water refrigeration systems that use only water (no chemicals) as refrigerant. The novel concept of a condensing wave rotor may then replace and combine in one dynamic system three subsystems needed in conventional systems: the compressor, the intercooler, and the condenser. This will compact these systems considerable and reduce the resources used for such systems. Application of the principle for other refrigerants is also envisioned as well as for fuel pumps and for pressure recovery devices for liquefied gases. <br/>A female graduate student will work on this exploratory one year project, supported by undergraduate students. The information obtained will be presented in both undergraduate and graduate classes as the PI has a tradition in his classes like Refrigeration, Thermodynamics, Heat Transfer and Turbomachinery. Furthermore, the findings are planed to be published in the International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer and the Annual Review of Fluid Mechanics, and will be presented at the ASME IMECE and ASHRAE Annual Meeting to inspire further applications. The test rig shall also be used for impressive demonstrations to high-school students at the SET day of the MSU Engineering College, where prospective students are invited to visit the laboratories.
0713858	A New Paradigm for Finite Difference Schemes on Adaptive Grids - Application to Free Surface Microfluidics	DMS	COMPUTATIONAL MATHEMATICS	08/15/2007	05/29/2009	Frederic Gibou	CA	University of California-Santa Barbara	Continuing grant	Leland M. Jameson	07/31/2010	$309,655.00		fgibou@engineering.ucsb.edu	Office of Research	Santa Barbara	CA	931062050	8058934188	MPS	1271	0000, 9263, OTHR	$0.00	In this work, the investigator devises innovative computational methods for free surface microfluidics in order to understand and control absorption and evaporation processes in the sub-micron scale open channels, as well as to understand how to efficiently control the effect of surface tension and temperature profiles along the channels. In particular, efficient numerical schemes on adaptive meshes are constructed in order to address the multiscale nature of the problem and the limitations of computer resources. The investigator introduces a new paradigm that allows the discretization of PDEs on highly adaptive meshes as if the mesh was uniform, while attaining second-order accuracy in the maximum norm. The numerical simulations are used to supplement physical experiments in order to optimize the design of free surface fluidics devices. The simulations take into account the temperature field in the liquid and the surrounding channel walls, the temperature-induced variations in surface tension, the subsequent surface tension driven flows in the transversal direction of the main flow (Marangoni effect) and their effects on the transport of airborne particles from the surface of the liquid to its bulk. Furthermore, the simulations take the configuration of the whole air-liquid system into account and determine the shape of the free surface in order to find a design that maximizes contact between the air and the liquid surface for efficient capture of airborne species.<br/><br/>In the past 15 years, significant advances have been made in using micro/nanofluidic-based platforms for detecting chemical and biological agents. However, all the `lab-on-a-chip' platforms reported in the literature can process samples only after the samples are injected into a microchannel. This longstanding technological and scientific barrier limits the viability of these platforms for monitoring airborne species at time when the great importance of this technology to national security issues has become clear. Free-surface fluidics is an innovative technology pioneered by the investigator's collaborators at UCSB which removes this barrier by enabling previously impossible detection thresholds for certain trace airborne chemical agents and pathogens. Airborne molecules can be directly absorbed through the free surface, where they can interact with gold or silver colloidal particles and be detected using Surface-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy. This platform could be used, for example, for public safety in a variety of venues to detect explosives and toxic chemicals, and for continuous monitoring of biological or chemical warfare agents in air ventilation systems. In this work, the investigator devises numerical methods in order to optimize the design of free-surface fluidic devices and to better understand the physical phenomena involved. These methods have an important impact on other fields as well, as they have key applications in the fields of semi-conductor processing and in the energy industry, in bio-nanotechnology and tissue engineering, in combustion as well as in the modeling of tumor growth to name a few. In addition, the investigator develops a freely available interactive web site on computational science and engineering which guides the users through a computational science journey, exploring intriguing topics such as microfluidics, crystal growth, single and multiphase flows. The users have the possibility of further interactive exploration by altering parameters to observe the effect on simulations, hence providing a tutorial on computational science.

While focusing on halophilic organisms from all three domains of life and viruses, the conference also addresses commonalities between high salinity and other conditions in which water activity is reduced (e.g. desiccation, freezing, high organic solute concentration). The overarching aim for this meeting is to draw on expertise from numerous disciplines in order to enable advances in our understanding of life in high-salt environments, and in turn for the improved understanding to enhance other areas of science.<br/><br/>In particular, this meeting is aimed at young scientists: A number of Assistant Professors have been added as invited speakers and will be given free passage and an opportunity to present. To this end, the organizers will increase the participation of US undergraduate students, graduate students, and post-doctoral researchers by offering them travel grants to defray the cost of their expenses. The application process will be aimed at members of underrepresented groups

Additionally, this project will analyze the data from ten accepted VLBA proposals that are performing targeted observations of some of the most extreme blazars. All experiments are either already observed or in the VLBA's queue to be observed within the next year.<br/><br/>The data products from the RRFID survey will have a significant broader impact on the blazar community. The final dataset will consist of approximately 10,000 VLBA images with 3,000 model fits, all publicly available. These will be used in large numbers of studies beyond those in this program. This program will involve undergraduates in research and also has high potential for broadening the participation of Hispanics in astronomy.

This research is to offer an answer for this pursuit and to establish a possibility-based network calculus theory that further extends the scope of this research line. The key methodology behind such a development is to apply Legendre transform at the sample-path level. Pilot research has shown some distinguished features that include: i) symmetric and decomposed characterization for traffic and service; ii) removal of highly nonlinear (min,+) convolution and de-convolution operators; iii) representation of single-node and tandem system performance bounds by summation of random variables; iv) recapture of effective bandwidth (capacity) and large deviations properties defined through the momentum generating functions; and v) tight bounds and improved scaling factor in the large deviations regime. It is expected that this research will open a new frontier in queuing theory and practice.<br/><br/>The proposed research will lead to a new theory for performance guarantees in queuing and other service systems that is expected to provide more accurate assessment of system performance and better management of system resources. Such a new theory will justify the vision of offering performance guarantees in diverse engineering and social systems such as communications networks (wireless, sensor networks and the high-speed Internet), supply chain and logistic systems, transportation and healthcare delivery systems; empowers the private sector to generate more value-adding business models (e.g. premium vs. ?best effort? service grades); and influences the public sector to construct robust infrastructures and to effectively assume its critical social responsibilities.

This project, uswarm, proposes a novel data-transfer architecture inspired by recent, tremendously successful swarming systems such as BitTorrent. The project pursues the following, rather exploratory, question: can swarms form the basis of a universal data-transfer architecture for a future Internet and if so, what is an appropriate architecture? Natural systems with swarm-like properties are known to be extremely robust both for an individual and for the system as a whole. The technical motivation is to make Internet data transfer: 1) scalable, 2) fault-tolerant, and 3) incentive-compatible, a trio of properties difficult to achieve using existing solutions. The research underlying uswarm will: 1) develop an in-network BitTorrent-like substrate deliver practically all data, not just large files, 2) exploit in-network storage and locality of data accesses, 3) analyze availability and human wait-time improvements of one large integrated swarm as opposed to BitTorrent-like isolated swarms, 4) analyze new traffic engineering knobs and routing choice naturally enabled by uswarm, 5) develop novel incentive strategies for integrated swarms accounting for network-level incentive issues, 6) analyze the interaction of selfish behavior with routing and congestion control using game-theoretic techniques. <br/><br/>Broader Impact: If successful, this project will fundamentally improve Internet data transfer by enabling: 1) critical information dissemination resistant to denial-of-information attacks, 2) delay-tolerant network applications, and 3) novel social networking applications. The proposed work includes undergraduate as well as international teaching and outreach activities integrated with the proposed research activities.

The triple bond between uranium and carbon has not yet been realized experimentally, but it has potential for the alkyne metathesis reaction. The proposed methods for delivering the uranium-carbon triple bond center on non-traditional, heterobimetallic bond-activation reactions, which allow for incorporation of a 13C isotopic label, which will be used to probe the nature of the uranium-carbon triple bond. This will be done using experimental CPMAS solid-state NMR methods, with data interpretation aided by quantum chemical calculations. The new reactions will be characterized in terms of structure, bonding, and mechanism with attempts to apply the new reactions in chemical synthesis.<br/><br/>The research will be performed in collaboration with Prof. Karsten Meyer at the University of Erlangen in Germany. Uranium chemistry is relevant to the problems associated with nuclear energy. By training students in this area, who will receive an international research experience, the project will contribute to our national competency in actinide science. Depleted uranium should become increasingly available as nuclear becomes a more popular source of clean energy; productive uses for depleted uranium represent a major potential societal benefit.

0707850	Wave Propagation and Resonance in Complex Media	DMS	APPLIED MATHEMATICS, MSPA-INTERDISCIPLINARY	08/15/2007	01/09/2013	Michael Weinstein	NY	Columbia University	Standard Grant	Henry A. Warchall	01/31/2014	$395,000.00		miw2103@columbia.edu	2960 Broadway	NEW YORK	NY	100276902	2128546851	MPS	1266, 7454	0000, 7303, OTHR	$0.00	This project concerns partial differential equations governing wave propagation in linear and nonlinear inhomogeneous media. The problems considered range from (a) fundamental analytical ones in wave propagation theory (nonlinear scattering theory, calculation of scattering resonances, and optimization of microstructures with respect to the lifetime of certain states) to (b) applications to optics (linear and nonlinear) and macroscopic quantum systems (Bose-Einstein condensation). The different research directions are unified by the themes of (i) energy transfer among different modes (e.g., coherent localized structures, such as solitons, vortices, and radiation modes) and (ii) control of coherent structures that are weakly coupled to an environment.<br/><br/>Interactions of waves (light, acoustic, fluid, electronic, gravitational, etc.) with inhomogeneities are ubiquitous in nature as well as in engineered systems. These interactions are governed by equations of physics, which, in the fundamental forms that incorporate all relevant physical effects, are intractable: In most interesting cases they cannot be solved, even with today's most powerful computers. Methods involving simplified mathematical models, mathematical analysis, and scientific computation working in tandem are essential to progress on the most important problems. This research is aimed at the development of such hybrid approaches to classes of wave interaction problems, with potential applications to, for example, design of optical devices and quantum information science.

Dixie Highway Suite 650	Coral Gables	FL	331462926	3052843924	BIO	1189	1189, 9184, BIOT	$0.00	This is a proposal to acquire an atomic force microscope (AFM) on an inverted optical microscope and to develop two AFM-related non-imaging instruments: one for measuring single-molecule force spectroscopy and inter-molecular forces; the other, for measuring elasticities of soft samples under physiological conditions at the nano-scale. Over the past 10 years, atomic force microscopy (AFM) has become an increasingly important tool in biological research. It has gained popularity in biological applications because, unlike electron microscopy, it can image samples under physiological conditions, including live cells undergoing biological processes. The AFM acquires a topographical image of the sample surface by raster scanning an atomically sharp probe over the sample. In addition to its different imaging modes, the AFM is a versatile instrument that can be applied as a nano-indenter and as a molecular force apparatus to probe the mechanical properties of the sample. As a nano-indenter, the AFM has provided direct measurements of the local viscoelastic properties of samples on the nanometer scale. As a molecular force apparatus, the AFM has been used to measure the unbinding force of individual ligand-receptor complexes and the unfolding of individual proteins. Another attractive feature of the AFM is that it can be readily combined with optical microscopy techniques such as FRET, FRAP, TIRF and confocal microscopy. By integrating optical microscopy and AFM into a single experimental platform, the optical image can be directly correlated with the AFM data, providing a powerful tool for studying biological process in situ and in real time. <br/><br/>The acquisition and development of these three instruments is the first step toward establishing an ultramicroscopy center at the university. The two instruments to be developed can be constructed very economically, based on the designs of existing AFMs from the principal investigator's laboratory; this will permit the commercial AFM to be dedicated to imaging applications. The commercial AFM will be the first imaging AFM in the South Florida area and will provide a much needed resource for the local research community. These instruments will provide valuable research opportunities for undergraduates and students from underrepresented groups as well as researchers from different disciplines within the university.
0720558	Doctoral Dissertation Research - Acquisition of Questions in Bulgarian and English	BCS	LINGUISTICS, COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH	09/01/2007	08/05/2007	Virginia Valian	NY	CUNY Graduate School University Center	Standard Grant	William J. Badecker	08/31/2010	$20,300.00		virginia.valian@hunter.cuny.edu	365 Fifth Avenue	New York	NY	100164309	2128177523	SBE	1311, 7298	0000, 1311, 5915, 5958, OTHR, 7298	$0.00	With support from the NSF Linguistics Program and the Office of International Science and Engineering this dissertation project will investigate language development in young Bulgarian and English children, concentrating on the development of questions. Young English-speaking children show a relatively protracted period of development in wh-questions (initiated by words like what and where), even though their input is uniform and perfect. The common errors are failure to include an auxiliary or failure to invert an auxiliary when it is present. The source of these errors is still unknown. Under the direction of Virginia Valian, Lidiya Tornyova will compare acquisition of both yes/no and wh-questions by 2- to 3-year-old Bulgarian- and English-speaking children, using an elicited imitation task in combination with natural observation. The study will address three broad research questions: 1) What is the role of cross-linguistic differences in the process of acquiring grammatical structures? 2) To what extent does the regularity of a language's structural properties determine the time-course and nature of its acquisition? 3) How do the differences in the distribution of regularity in two independent domains - question formation and overt subject use - affect language learning? The differences in question formation in Bulgarian and English will, we predict, make wh-questions easier to acquire in Bulgarian. We hypothesize that overt subject production in wh-questions will reflect requirements of the target language. Since Bulgarian is a null-subject language, we predict children will omit subjects more often than English-speaking children will.<br/><br/>The research will increase our understanding of the development of questions by examining acquisition from a cross-linguistic perspective. Most of the data on yes/no and wh-question acquisition are from English. It is not known whether claims and hypotheses developed from English can be extended to languages, such as Bulgarian, which differ in important properties from English. Studying the development of Bulgarian questions will also help assess current contradictory claims and hypotheses proposed by studies on English language acquisition. The study will be the first investigation of Bulgarian acquisition of syntax. In a broader sense, the project will help establish collaborative research on early acquisition of Bulgarian. Lidiya Tornyova will collaborate with Dr. Krassimira Petrova, Assistant Professor of Slavic Studies at the University of Sofia, Bulgaria. The project will contribute recordings and transcriptions of Bulgarian spontaneous adult-child conversations to the CHILDES data bank, creating the first on-line corpus of Bulgarian child language.

The method of fabricating silicon silicon photonic crystal fiber is innovative in that it is a conversion process, rather than the traditional drawing process. It leverages on the recently-established silica silicon photonic crystal fiber technology and newly discovered magnesiothemic reduction processes. Everything that has been done in the near IR can be replicated in the infrared, especially the mid-IR with the availability of the silicon photonic crystal fiber. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts:<br/>The silicon silicon photonic crystal fiber and the Mid infrared generation and detection technology can bring extensive benefits to the scientific community and the society. It leads to new capabilities in Mid infrared including transport, linear and nonlinear spectroscopy. These new capabilities in turn will enable many commercial and defense applications. For example, Mid infrared transport can be used for laser surgery; Mid infrared spectroscopy can be used for medical diagnostics and environmental sensing. High power Mid infrared generation and sensitive detection can be used in lidar, sensor, secure communications and countermeasures.

The powder XRD will support a range of research requiring phase identification and crystallographic structure determinations of natural and man made materials. Studies of the interface structure and reactivity of iron oxyhydroxides under a range of environmental conditions, studies of phase relationships, speciation and partitioning behavior of transition metals that are released to the environment via weathering and ore mineral processing, studies of the mineralogy of artic ice-brine systems, phase identification of paleosols and igneous rock forming minerals, and characterization of synthetic materials including high temperature ceramics and nanocomposite piezoelectric materials for use in miniaturized electronic devices will all be facilitated. The new powder XRD would be the first state-of-the-art XRD in the state of Alaska and will support faculty and student research across the Departments of Geology and Geophysics, the UAF Geophysical Institute, Chemistry and Biochemistry, Plant, Animal and Soil Science, Mechanical Engineering, Civil and Environmental Engineering, Geological Engineering, the UAF Mineral Industry Research Laboratory, the Petroleum Development Laboratory, and the UAF Office of Electronic Miniaturization.

At the same time, experiments with WSN testbeds have exposed a number of shortcomings of the current technologies that hamper the wider adoption of this technology by domain scientists. In particular, inexpensive sensor transducers used as sensors often fail intermittently in complex and unexpected ways. Moreover, given the small number of sensors, their hardware limitations, and the complexity of tracking unexpected phenomena, sensor networks may fail to accurately record punctuated events (e.g. flash floods and hailstorms). <br/><br/>In this project we compare the effectiveness and efficiency of different statistical methods used to detect whether sensors are misbehaving. We investigate both off-line and on-line techniques that can be implemented on resource-limited sensor nodes to detect faults in real time. We also investigate the use of similar techniques for learning the inherent characteristics of the physical phenomena that the network is monitoring. This knowledge can be used to dynamically detect and report the onset of punctuated events and modify the behavior of the network accordingly. We will evaluate the performance of these algorithms using archived data and implement them on the nodes of a wireless sensor network used for soil monitoring. The outcome of this project will be a set of algorithms that can be broadly used to build responsive and efficient wireless sensor networks for sensor-based science.
0709248	Boltzmann Equation and Multi-Dimensional Shock Interactions in Gas Dynamics	DMS	APPLIED MATHEMATICS	08/15/2007	05/13/2015	Tai-Ping Liu	CA	Stanford University	Continuing grant	Henry A. Warchall	07/31/2016	$440,000.00		liu@math.stanford.edu	3160 Porter Drive	Palo Alto	CA	943041212	6507232300	MPS	1266	0000, OTHR	$0.00	The goal of this project is to study nonlinear waves and boundary phenomena in gas flow. The project has two parts: (1) The study of boundary effects from the point of view of kinetic theory, in particular, the Boltzmann shock layer, initial layer, and their interactions, and the thermal, curvature, and condensation effects of the solid boundary; (2) Study of multidimensional gas flow with shocks, in particular, the effects of shock reflections from a solid boundary on the overall flow patterns for the compressible Euler equations. <br/><br/>To analyze boundary effects from the point of view of kinetic theory is physically natural, as the inclusion of the microscopic velocity in the Boltzmann solutions allows for physically realistic modeling of the solid boundary conditions. It is mathematically challenging, as the boundary condition, such as the Maxwell type of the interpolation of specular and diffusion reflection conditions, makes possible the study of the rich interactions of particles and fluid waves. This project will pursue local analysis of the physical phenomena. <br/><br/>Multi-dimensional gas flow with shocks is the consequence of the strongly nonlinear effect of compression and the global interaction of the gas with the solid boundary. Mathematical analysis thereby becomes highly nonlinear and global. New extremal principles are needed for the construction of solutions with free boundary for nonlinear partial differential equations of mixed types. Already, an Ellipticity Principle has helped to explain that, with given boundary condition at far field, the uniqueness is possible only for self-similar flow, and not for stationary flows. <br/><br/>The study of the boundary effects on gas flow is of great importance for engineering practices. Mathematical analysis is needed for quantitative and qualitative understanding of the physical process. A classical example is the vacuum pump based on the phenomenon of thermal gradient flow, rather than on mechanical devices, to generate pressure differences. Preliminary analytical studies show that the thermal gradient flow is stronger for more rarefied gases, an important consideration in the design of vacuum pumps. The study of Prandtl's conjecture and the von Neumann paradox in compressible gas flows provides basic understanding for the shock structure of supersonic flight. For instance, mathematical analysis quantifies the difference between the shock structure at the nose and that inside the engine of an aircraft. This project aims to advance understanding of the mathematical models of these important processes.

The resulting electron density profiles will provide images of the bubble structures that are thought to cause the phenomena of radio frequency scintillations and equatorial spread-F.  The project will include algorithm development, data collection campaigns, and data analysis.  The algorithms to be developed will perform diffraction tomography calculations; the input data are received Radio Frequency (RF) signal amplitudes and phases from an array of receivers that are experiencing scintillations. The algorithms will estimate electron density profiles by developing and applying model estimation/inversion techniques to models such as a phase screen with Fresnel forward scattering. The estimation techniques will exploit the availability of dual-frequency GPS scintillation data that can be monitored because of new civilian GPS L2 signals now becoming available. They will also exploit the ability of GPS to make group-delay measurements; use of these data will follow development of a model predicting how group delay is affected by a disturbed ionosphere. The algorithms will be applied to data from two types of equatorial scintillation collection campaigns. One type of campaign will collect data using small arrays of wide-band digital storage receivers and MATLAB post-processing to acquire and track scintillating signals. The second type will use a medium sized array of real-time GPS software radio receivers. Some of the effort will go toward completing development of the latter type of receiver. Two distinctive features of this project are its use of  very robust receiver technology, which will enable collection of very accurate RF amplitude and phase data for very strong scintillations and its development of generalized estimation/inversion algorithms.  These algorithms that go beyond the capabilities of currently existing or proposed algorithms in their use of multi-frequency data, in their problem formulations, and in their algorithmic implementation based on optimization or fixed-point methods.   The project focuses on very strong scintillations since these are the most important from an operational standpoint since they have the biggest impact on communications and navigation signals.  The project's broader impacts include the development of instruments that can be used in education as well as in research and the improved communication and navigation system reliability that will result from an improved understanding of scintillations.

Nanostructures and dynamic materials from gases will also be designed. Specific problems to be addressed include the design, synthesis and host-guest chemistry of NOX trapping, separating, storing and releasing molecules, including calixarene-based cages and nanotubes; supramolecular activation and fixation of SO2 gas, and supramolecular fixation of CO2, which results in switchable, functional nanostructures, so-called double dynamers. These are based on reversible chemistry of CO2 and amines and also involve hydrogen bonding. The proposed program will continue to lead efforts in molecular recognition with gases and also demonstrate that greenhouse gases can now be used as molecular and supramolecular building blocks.<br/>This award from the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports Professor Dimitry Rudkevich of the University of Texas- Arlington whose research opens new ways for chemical utilization of atmospheric gases where greenhouse gases can now be used as building blocks. Considering the huge significance of gases in the environment, the program offers means for creating environmentally responsive materials. Professor Rudkevich will continue publishing general reviews on supramolecular chemistry of gases, thus reaching out to the broad chemistry readership and attracting them to the field. Publications from the PI's laboratory have been highlighted in Science, J. Chem. Ed. and other magazines, and also on the Internet. Since its initiation 5 years ago, his has involved dozens of high school, undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral students. An interdisciplinary course for undergraduate/graduate students on supramolecular chemistry and technology of gases is being developed, because the significance of gases has been largely overlooked in college education. More than 10 students from underrepresented groups, such as African-Americans, Hispanic, Asian Americans, and female students have been actively involved in research in the PI's group. Collaborations have been initiated with a number of research centers on supramolecular technology and nanotechnology of gases. These include the UTA's Automation and Robotics Research Institute, Center for Green Manufacturing at The University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, the National Energy Technology Lab at DOE, the University of Pittsburgh, as well as the Institut Europeen des Membranes in Monpellier (France) and the University of Fukui (Japan).

For many youth this exposure may lead to new expectations and aspirations for their future.  However, for low-income youth in developing countries, economic realities may prevent them from attaining their aspirations. These same aspirations may also create inter-generational conflict as the values of young people differ from established social norms. Researchers, Dr. Craig Haldey and Dr. Daniel Mains, will study the impact that these mismatches have on youth's lives and pyschosocial health, and how this relationship is modified by social, cultural, and economic factors. They will carry out the research  in Ethiopia where the majority of the population is young and high levels of poverty act as barriers to the fulfillment aspirations.<br/> <br/>The investigators will rely on qualitative ethnographic data collection methods and social survey techniques. The non-survey methods will include unstructured interviews, free listing, and group discussions and will be used to elicit locally and culturally appropriate conceptions of a successful life and important milestones from youth and adults.  Youth and adults will then be asked to rank the relative importance of elements of a successful life. The most important elements and those that are collectively shared will be integrated into a survey that will be administered to a population-based sample of nearly 2000 youth (15-19 y). For each element, youth will respond how important they think the item is to a successful life, whether they have achieved that item, and their perceived likelihood of every achieving it. The mental health, economic status, and social support networks of youth will also be measured through the survey. Through this survey the investigators can assess the mental health impact of failure or inability to achieve culturally agreed upon milestones. <br/><br/>The research is important because it  integrates a range of methodologies. The researchers use social science to address several emerging issues: globalization, mental health, and current demographic realities in many developing countries.<br/><br/> <br/>

This theme is especially important in connection with the operational dynamics of multi-national enterprises (MNEs) and their continually changing global business strategies. Success in holding down the global (local embeddedness) and thereby generating self-reproducing growth cannot be reduced to a set of narrow technological or economic factors. Institutional thickness is important. Significant too is the knowledge production and sharing when economic agents work together. Firm resident knowledge as distinct from knowledge produced in everyday practice between actors both spatially proximate and non-spatially proximate also is important. Moreover, development of competitive advantage is clearly related to the process of creating value added through a supply chain in a global production framework. The overarching goal of the research project is to gain a deeper understanding of the ways in which multinational enterprises (MNEs) interact with suppliers and to generalize these behaviors. This is analyzed within the context of the learning and innovative process by examining the supply chain structure and distribution practices of a sample of multi-national enterprises and their supplier firms operating in Penang, Malaysia. The aim is to detail the nature of the growth of new practices associated with supply value chain development and management and show how this varies among firms in the technology sector. Corporate core values, ownership strategy, technological sophistication, logistical practices, complexity of actor interaction in the value chain, degree of capitalization, product form and life cycle and especially governance structures will be used as influencing variables in assessing the different ways in which firms interact and learning takes place. The research will be motivated by a series of questions. Among these are the ways in which learning and adaptation are expressed in supply chain structures and logistics. In addition how is tacit versus codified knowledge conveyed among and between MNEs and their supplier firms? Specifically how are issues of information sharing, communication, management and the adoption of new technologies in supply chain management and organization represented and codified? How do differing logistical structures perform in anchoring creative learning toward competitive advantage? The research will be conducted in collaboration with Universiti Sains Malaysia and will be carried out in two separate field phases. Data will be gathered from both MNEs and supplier firms through structured and unstructured interviews with supply chain and management personnel in the firms.<br/><br/>The results will strengthen our understanding of the organization and learning dimensions of the theory of the firm. It also will aid in deepening our understanding of global production networks, specifically examining relations between MNEs and supplier firms in order to enhance conceptual frameworks which aim to understand the economic development prospects of regions, especially in Southeast Asia. It will show how MNEs network with and transfer new knowledge/information (both tacit and explicit) to SMEs in the technology sector of peripheral regions. Finally, the research will add to basic understanding of the learning process, the ubiquitous nature of technology, and how the dynamics of governance structures fit into and aid the capability of supply value chains to adapt to new, different, or changing requirements.
0719493	Collaborative Research: Biogeochemistry of Neoproterozoic Snowball Earth and Its Aftermath in South China	EAR	GEOBIOLOGY & LOW TEMP GEOCHEM	09/01/2007	08/10/2007	Alex Sessions	CA	California Institute of Technology	Standard Grant	Enriqueta Barrera	11/30/2010	$50,000.00		als@gps.caltech.edu	1200 E California Blvd	PASADENA	CA	911250600	6263956219	GEO	7295	0000, OTHR	$0.00	The Neoproterozoic geological record contains evidence for extreme climatic change which may have profoundly influenced the course of biological evolution, particularly around the so-called Snowball Earth episodes of the Sturtian, Marinoan and Gaskiers glaciations. During the Neoproterozoic, body fossils and molecular biomarkers interpreted as being derived from multicellular animals have been reported although the radiation of basal animals is presently poorly constrained at sometime between the Sturtian and Marinoan glaciations. In this study, we aim to produce detailed temporal records of Neoproterozoic marine biogeochemistry from molecular biomarker analyses, organic and inorganic stable isotope records (including 13C, 2H and 34S) and from inorganic geochemical proxies of paleoredox for four sections in the Nanhua Basin in South China. This will allow us to investigate the effects of low-latitude Neoproterozoic glaciation on primary production, carbon cycling and redox structure applied to a shallow shelf-to-deep basinal paleoenvironmental transect. <br/><br/>Given the scientific interest in fossilized animal fauna and other fossils from the Doushantuo Formation in South China, it may seem surprising that no detailed molecular biomarker records currently exist for the Neoproterozic in South China. This is undoubtedly due to the high thermal maturity of some sections and due to the inherent problems of discerning low concentrations of genuine Neoproterozic biomarker signals above a significant background of petroleum-derived contaminants. A scoping study has revealed that the thermal maturity of strata in our four sections in Nanhua Basin is not problematic for preserving detectable biomarker hydrocarbon signals. The originality and principal strength of the biomarker lipid work proposed here lies in obtaining kerogen-bound biomarker records which allow us to access a high proportion of the preserved biomarker record in Nanhua Basin essentially free from contamination effects. The PI's research has demonstrated the efficacy of a continuous flow catalytic hydropyrolysis (HyPy) technique for fragmenting kerogen and releasing covalently-bound biomarker constituents to essentially ground-truth all the biomarker lipid data obtained. <br/><br/>We will address some fundamental questions regarding the biogeochemical history of the Neoproterozoic in South China: <br/>-Can we detect significant changes in marine redox structure in the immediate aftermath of the Sturtian and Marinon glaciations using our inorganic and biomarker proxies and, if so, is there strong evidence for concomitant fluctuations in source organism input? <br/>-Can we discern significantly different responses of shallow- versus deep-water settings to the aftermath of the glaciations in terms of their redox profiles and biota? <br/>-Can we detect specific steroid markers for basal animals (sponges) in the Nanhua Basin and, if so, when do these first appear relative to the Sturtian and Marinoan glaciations? <br/><br/>Broader Impacts. The research will significantly improve our understanding of the extent to which the intense climatic shock of the Sturtian and Marinoan glaciations impacted on marine microbial communities by modifying nutrient cycling, dissolved oxygen availability and creating environmental niches in low latitude marine environments. In terms of providing educational opportunities, Love and Lyons will participate during each of the project years in the UCR Mentoring Summer Research Internship Program, whereby undergraduate students from ethnic groups historically underrepresented in the sciences (particularly the earth sciences) will receive hands-on experience in the two labs. Finally, our project will benefit greatly from collaboration with Professor Xuelei Chu (Institute of Geology and Geophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences) and his research group, who have considerable experience of studying Neoproterozoic glacial strata in South China. Chu and colleagues will visit the Southern California biogeochemical community at Caltech and UCR during the course of the project to discuss findings and to promote long-term collaborative links.
0723864	Collaborative Research: OLAC: Accessing the World's Language Resources	BCS	LINGUISTICS	08/15/2007	05/19/2009	Gary Simons	TX	Graduate Institute of Applied Linguistics	Continuing grant	Joan Maling	07/31/2011	$107,200.00		gary_simons@sil.org	7500 W Camp Wisdom Road	Dallas	TX	752365629	9727087552	SBE	1311	OTHR, 0000	$0.00	Language resources are the bread and butter of language documentation and linguistic investigation. They include the primary objects of study such as texts and recordings, the outputs of research such as dictionaries and grammars, and the enabling technologies such as software tools and interchange standards. Increasingly, these resources are maintained and distributed in digital form. Although language resources have begun to proliferate on the web, they are often difficult or impossible to locate and reuse. In this collaborative research project, Drs. Mark Liberman and Steven Bird of the University of Pennsylvania and Dr. Gary Simons of the Graduate Institute of Applied Linguistics will address this problem through new research to enhance the digital infrastructure of the Open Language Archives Community (OLAC). OLAC provides a standard set of language resource descriptors and a portal that permits users to query dozens of language archives simultaneously using a single search. However, the current coverage of OLAC is only the tip of the iceberg. The aim of the project is to greatly improve access to language resources for linguists and the broader communities of interest, by achieving an order-of-magnitude increase in the coverage of the OLAC catalog and in the use of OLAC search services. The project will do so through two main areas of activity: developing guidelines and services that encourage language archives to follow best common practices that will facilitate language resource discovery through OLAC, and developing services to bridge from the resource catalogs of the library and web domains to the OLAC catalog.<br/><br/>The project should have a broad impact across the field of linguistics by developing an online service that gives linguists access to resources for the thousands of languages in the world. But the impact will extend well beyond the linguistics community. Access to these language resources will assist technologists who are endeavoring to make information technologies work with every language, not just a select few. It will also permit educators, students and members of society at large to access a wealth of materials that demonstrate the full range of linguistic diversity in the world. Yet another audience for access to language resources are the actual speakers of all the languages of the world. In the case of endangered languages, access to language resources is a critical asset in the process of language revitalization. The project will also serve to advocate the widespread use of ISO 639-3, a newly adopted standard that provides codes for precisely identifying the 7,500 known human languages, past and present. This will encourage reform in current cataloging practice which is based on an earlier ISO standard that recognizes fewer than 400 languages, and begin the process of helping the major storehouses of knowledge around the world to deal appropriately with linguistic diversity.

However, current electronic commerce applications such as online auction systems are not trustworthy due to a lack of effective trust management mechanisms. A trustworthy online auction system requires a dynamic trust management system that can detect abnormal bidding activities in real-time, notify the involved users, and cancel the corresponding auction immediately.<br/><br/>This project investigates an agent-based approach for dynamic trust management in online auctions. The approach supports real-time monitoring, analyzing, and detection of abnormal bidding behaviors in online auction systems so the trustworthiness of such systems can be ensured. Specific problems to be addressed in this project include 1) investigating efficient formal methods, such as model checking techniques, for analysis of real-time auction data; 2) defining a real-time trust model that supports trust re-evaluation; and 3) formulating intelligent agents that support reasoning with uncertainty and incomplete information. The research activities will result in a loosely coupled agent-based trust management (ATM) module in online auction systems. The project will have favorable broader impacts on trustworthy computing research, education, as well as industrial applications. The results from this project can help to develop trustworthy systems in electronic commerce, and will contribute to boost the US economy by providing a safe and trusted environment for Internet-based trading.

Warchall	07/31/2011	$154,279.00		xdw@math.tulane.edu	6823 ST CHARLES AVENUE	NEW ORLEANS	LA	701185698	5048654000	MPS	1266	0000, 9150, OTHR, 7237	$0.00	This project investigates the spectra of elliptic operators that arise in models of thermal insulator coatings. Analytical and numerical research will be carried out in two areas. Work in the first area will use Dirichlet eigenvalues and eigenfunctions to measure the thermal insulation properties of an anisotropic material. The principal and higher Dirichlet eigenvalues will be estimated rigorously and numerically by using only the three rotational invariants of the thermal tensor of the material. These estimates will be used to study the optimal design of nano insulators and to inversely find the invariants of the thermal tensor. The project will also investigate the Robin eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of an isotropic body coated by an anisotropic insulator. Work in the second area will continue development of a theory to estimate the first positive Neumann eigenvalue of the Laplacian and will investigate inverse scattering problems in which a closely related eigenvalue problem arises. Applications include optimal design of periodic structures in diffractive optics technology.<br/><br/>The first part of the project is motivated by significant engineering applications in nano-composite materials science. Efficient thermal insulators can be created by proper designing of nano-composite materials, which, at the macroscale, commonly exhibit anisotropy. For such a material, the principal Dirichlet eigenvalue of the corresponding elliptic operator can be used to measure the thermal insulation effectiveness. The user-friendly estimates developed in this project of Dirichlet eigenvalues will be helpful in designing better nano-composite thermal insulators and in understanding the thermal tensor when its analytic formula is not available. This work extends studies of the practical problem of protecting an isotropic conductor (e.g., a space shuttle) from overheating by an anisotropic coating; an easy-to-use rule for the optimal thickness of the coating required has been obtained. This rule is potentially widely applicable in thermal engineering. The second part of the project addresses measurement of the strength of diffusion in a well-insulated container. The expected applications of this theory include the uniqueness of the inverse problem that arises in the optimal design of periodic structures in diffractive optics technology.

One case of particular interest is in genus 1, where the PI is studying mixed motives associated to elliptic curves. With Makoto Matsumoto (Hiroshima University) the PI is studying the action of the absolute Galois group on the Malcev completion of the fundamental group of a once-punctured elliptic curve and also on the relative completion of the corresponding mapping class group. With Gregory Pearlstein (Michigan State) the PI is studying variations of mixed Hodge structure over moduli spaces of elliptic curves and their relationship to iterated integrals of modular forms recently defined by Yuri Manin. The Galois and Hodge structures are parallel and the PI expects each approach to illuminate the other. In other projects, the PI and his collaborators are developing general machinery needed to study the case of elliptic motives. On the Galois side, Matsumoto and the PI are proving basic results about Galois actions on completions of arithmetic mapping class groups. On the Hodge side, Pearlstein, Terasoma and the PI are developing fundamental mathematical tools for studying general classes of variations of mixed Hodge structure over complex algebraic varieties.<br/><br/>Motives encode deep connections between the theory of whole numbers, integrals of certain algebraic functions and topology. Each of these theories has its own set of symmetries, and all are related through the theory of motives. The PI, together with his collaborators and students, are investigating the interactions of these symmetry groups that are associated to ``elliptic curves'', which are curves defined by cubic polynomials. Although this work is foundational, it has potential applications to cryptography and pseudo random number generation. Indeed, the PI's principal collaborator, Matsumoto (Hiroshima University), is an established expert in these subjects.

Objectives are to gain understanding and control over the synthesis and processing of CrO2 and related rutile materials into heterostructures using a combined experiment/theory approach. Pulsed laser deposition and laser-assisted chemical vapor deposition (LCVD) will be used for the growth of the heterostructures. In LCVD, energy from a laser is used to photochemically decompose a gas precursor to provide epitaxial CrO2 growth at low pressure with in-situ electron diffraction crystal growth monitoring to obtain spin transport quality CrO2 films and interfaces. Both Meservey- Tedrow and inelastic tunneling spectroscopy will be performed, as well as basic magneto-transport to characterize prototype device structures. <br/>Non-technical: The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of electronic/photonic materials science with high technological relevance. Research and educational activities will be integrated with involvement of both graduate and undergraduates in the research program. Collaborations with Oak Ridge National Laboratory and international collaborations provide added benefits and special opportunities to assist integration of research and education. The project includes collaborations with minority faculty members from Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs).

Broad Street	PHILADELPHIA	PA	191405104	2157077379	MPS	7623	1711, 7573, 9161, AMPP	$0.00	INTELLECTUAL MERIT: This proposal addresses the properties of liposomes made from lipids extracted from thermophylic microorganisms (archaea). These unusual lipids involve two hydrophobic hydrocarbon chains attached at each end through ether linkages to a glycerol moiety. The third (terminal) glycerol hydroxyl at each end carries a hydrophylic group that is frequently sugar based and may or may not be phosphorylated. These lipids form monolayer membranes and liposomes, termed tetraether archaeal liposomes (TAL), in which the two chains of the hydrocarbon portion of each lipid molecule span the entire membrane thickness. The hydrocarbon chains are essentially linear alkanes decorated periodically with methyl groups. Within each such chain there may be up to four cyclopentanyl groups, depending on the temperature at which the bacteria are grown; those grown at higher temperatures have greater numbers of cyclopentane rings. In comparison to other liposome systems, the resulting liposomes show remarkable resistance to changes in temperature, pH gradient, mechanical stress, pressure, and chemical features of the environment. This project is designed to test the following hypotheses: (1) an increase in the number of cyclopentane rings in archaeal lipids will increase membrane rigidity and tightness, (2) a change in vesicle curvature will induce a change in transmembrane asymmetry, which in turn changes membrane packing, (3) there exist optimal membrane compositions and sugar contents that will yield the most stable TAL structures. To test these hypotheses, a variety of physical techniques such as dynamic light scattering, high-pressure probe techniques, fluorescence spectroscopy, calorimetry, and electron microscopy will be used.<br/><br/>BROADER IMPACTS: TAL are remarkably stable to temperature, pH, and other 'stresses', and therefore show great promise as targeted carriers, drug delivery agents, and coatings. They represent a new class of autoclavable monolayer encapsulating agents with programmable stability and permeability. The PI has trained more than 30 undergraduate students from under represented groups in his laboratory in the past 13 years. He will continue to support undergraduate research participation under this new project. He also participates in the Temple University Physician Scientist Training Program for minority high school students, and he has hosted eight such students in the past four years. This activity will also continue under the new grant.

Szekely	07/31/2008	$45,000.00		joel-horowitz@northwestern.edu	1801 Maple Ave.	Evanston	IL	602013149	8474913003	MPS	1269	0000, OTHR	$0.00	This project studies penalized methods for variable selection and estimation in high-dimensional models. A general approach for fitting high-dimensional models is to use regularization penalties. Several important penalized methods for variable selection and estimation have been proposed, but the properties of these methods have not been systematically studied. To apply the methods in scientific investigations, it is important to understand their properties. In particular, it is important to know under what conditions, the methods correctly select the important variables and estimate their effects in an efficient way. Standard methods for evaluating a statistical procedure assume that the number of variables in a model is fixed and much smaller than the sample size. This formulation is not applicable to high-dimensional models. The problem of analyzing high-dimensional models presents novel and challenging theoretical questions in mathematical statistics. Current variable selection methods using penalties assume a known form of the statistical model, which can be a misrepresentation of the reality. It is important to investigate what happens if a parametric model is misspecified or if no parametric assumptions are made about the model. In particular, it is important to know whether there are conditions under which penalized methods select variables correctly despite misspecification and under what conditions misspecification causes them to yield misleading results. It is also important to extend the penalized methods to nonparametric and semiparametric models.<br/><br/>High-dimensional data arise in many important applications, notably biological and biomedical investigations. With rapid advances in biotechnology, more and more large data sets are being generated. The identification of statistically and biologically significant patterns from high-dimensional and noisy data sets is a major challenge. The investigators apply the proposed research to genome-wide association (GWA) analysis, detection of copy number variation (CNV), and analysis of censored survival data with gene expression profiles. GWA analysis and detection of CNV enable the identification of genes and pathways responsible for the development and progression of a disease, such as many forms of cancer. Correlating a gene expression profiles with survival is useful, because survival is perhaps the most important clinical endpoint in many cancer studies. The development of statistical methods that can deal with high-dimensional problems in estimating the relationship between clinical outcomes and genetic and genomic data contribute to better understanding of the genetic basis of diseases, better diagnoses, and better survival prediction.

Static and time-resolved X-ray crystallography, ultrafast spectroscopy and mutational analysis will be used to investigate the remarkable photodynamic behavior of mTFP0.7. This protein undergoes facile photoswitching between fluorescent and nonfluorescent states while the derived but closely related protein, mTPF1, is photostable. Spectroscopic, thermodynamic and comparative structural studies will help understand how the three dimensional structures of the proteins control the emission properties of the internal chromophore. The time resolved structural and spectroscopic studies of mTFP0.7 will reveal details of molecular rearrangements, due to chromophore isomerization, that are broadly relevant to the photophysics of many biological molecules (such as those involved in vision and photosynthesis) and will provide insight into the nature of transient light/dark switching processes observed for other types of fluorophores. The understanding gained from this work will be useful to improve the properties of these and related fluorescent proteins for use as practical, light emitting probes for studies of living cells. Anticipated uses of photoactivatable probes, also termed optical highlighters, include selective marking of molecular assemblies for study of active transport within cells and development of new techniques in high resolution fluorescence microscopy.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/>The interdisciplinary nature of the effort and the great variety of experimental techniques will provide excellent multidisciplinary training for students and postdoctoral researchers. Due to their visual appeal, ease of production and isolation combined with exceptional physical stability, fluorescent proteins provide outstanding teaching material for laboratory courses at the high school and university levels and the results from this research will be used for the development of new instructional protocols. Finally, animated illustrations of observed molecular motions and other details of the photodynamic behavior will be disseminated to the interested public via the Internet, in the form of instructional videos and textual materials.

This involves a close collaboration with the Max Planck Institute for Radioastronomy (MPIfR, Bonn, Germany). A high-quality catalog of SZE-selected clusters over a broad range of redshifts will provide deep insight into structure formation, high accuracy measurements of cosmological parameters, and a characterization of the dark energy equation of state. This dark energy measurement is complementary in parameter degeneracies to other types, such as those using supernovae. SZE surveys are expected to have a cleaner selection function that extends to higher redshift than optical and X-ray techniques. Hundreds of galaxy clusters will be detected, with as many as one hundred at redshift one or greater.<br/><br/>APEX is a fully operational 12-meter diameter on-axis Cassegrain telescope sited at 16,700 ft on the Chajnantor plateau in Chile. It was built by a consortium of the MPIfR, the European Southern Observatory (ESO), and the Swedish Onsala Space Observatory. The SZE survey will use at least one month of telescope time per year, and this allotment may increase. The receiver has had a successful engineering run and been upgraded to the observational configuration. This program leverages the substantial investments in receiver development and deployment, in superconducting transition edge sensors (TES), and in construction and operation of the telescope, by NSF and by the various national and international partners.<br/><br/>The planned calibration of the mass to SZE flux relation by APEX in an early emphasis project will be critical for interpreting the large cluster samples expected from future surveys by other telescopes. This will be carried out using multi-wavelength data from a variety of experiments all looking at the same patch of sky, and comparing the SZE data against measurements using optical weak lensing, optical galaxy counts, X-ray flux, and velocity dispersions. The work will cement relations across a strong international team. In addition, the detector development work has widespread implications for astronomy, other physics communities, and homeland security.

The transition is thought to be similar to a metal-insulator transition but is additionally length dependent, involving electron localization triggered by a voltage bias. The approach includes transport measurements as a function of temperature and field (electrical and magnetic) under various conditions (film thickness, cell size, composition, electrode types) and material science synthesis and processing issues in materials combinations (electrodes, matrix:conductor, substrate) and to compare behaviors of materials combinations. Also, quantum mechanical modeling of electron transport along discrete elements consisting of contacts and conducting islands will be performed taking into account self energy, state occupancy (Fermi-Dirac) statistics and electrostatics (solving equivalent circuits made of essentially capacitors), and effects of charge trapping. <br/>Non-technical: The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of electronic/photonic materials science with high technological relevance. It is considered a high risk/high potential pay-off project. The interdisciplinary nature of the research and the combined experiment and modeling approach provide additional opportunities for students to broaden their educational experience.

They will measure velocities using Impulsive Stimulated Light Scattering on samples loaded in diamond anvil cells. The team seeks to characterize derivatives in velocity of ferro-periclase caused by changes in electronic configuration, iron content, temperature and pressure. These results will be interpreted within the context of Earth's deep mantle through further extension and application of the theory for the transition. Ultimately, elastic constants for ferro-periclase should be measured under mantle conditions of temperature in excess of 1000K as well as pressure. However, a reasonable goal in the near term will be to undertake high-pressure studies under modest conditions of heating and cooling. A quantitative validation of predictions under experimentally accessible conditions of temperature would lend confidence in the extrapolation to mantle temperatures. The successful characterization of elastic properties through the HSLS transition in iron-bearing silicate perovskites remains a longer term goal.  Challenges include obtaining samples of sufficient quality to undertake the experiments. The project includes training of a graduate student.<br/><br/><br/>

A disaster-tolerant communication network must work despite interference among users as arises when first responders converge at a disaster site. Conventional interference avoidance methods offer diminishing capacity per user as the user density increases. Cooperative communication can solve the problem by taking advantage of the interference, thus saving total network transmit power. However, the performance of existing cooperative communication algorithms vary significantly with the channel statistics for which they are designed and, also, waste received mutual information when the channel is better than the transmission rate or suffer an outage when the channel cannot support the transmission rate. This research explores the design of a cooperative communication system, composed of single or multiple antenna nodes, that works across varying channel conditions in the sense that outage is eliminated and received mutual information is not wasted. The goal of the project is to take an information theoretic solution all the way to a single-chip implementation to advance communication and coding, as well as system-on-chip (SoC) implementation. The project tackles research problems that are at the intersection of three areas: (i) communication theory, (ii) very large-scale integration (VLSI) signal processing, and (iii) system-on-chip architecture and design.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: The project advances interdisciplinary communication system research and design. The system-on-chip realization has the potential for application in future fixed or mobile ad-hoc wireless networks with the capability to work under strong interference as required by first responders, potentially strengthening national security and emergency preparedness. The proposed project provides an educational opportunity to expose students to the diverse aspects of communication system theory and practice. It will also involve undergraduate students and students from underrepresented groups through an integrated research and education program.

The project will develop the first wearable camera system capable of perceiving and visualizing social-emotional information in real-time human interaction. Using a small wearable camera and video-pattern analysis algorithms, the system analyzes video of the wearer or interaction partner and tags it at multiple granularities (facial actions, communicative facial or head gestures, and emotions). <br/><br/>The wearable system aims to: (1) facilitate learning and systemizing of social-emotional cues; (2) promote self-reflection and perspective-taking; (3) allow wearers to study subtle nonverbal cues and share experiences with peers, family members, and caregivers; and (4) contribute new computational models and theories of social-emotional intelligence in machines. A clinical study will compare the efficacy of the wearable system to current gold standard interventions for autism spectrum disorders (ASD). A participatory approach to the co-design and use of technology draws on the experiences of individuals with ASD and their solutions to systematizing social interactions, thereby empowering them to enhance their relationships, while participating in the development of next-generation social-emotional intelligent technologies.<br/><br/>The project will make significant contributions to the difficult challenge of developing machine intelligence that is robust at handling human social interaction. When people or machines fail to perceive, understand, and act on social-emotional cues they are hindered in their ability to interact with and learn from others. The results of this interdisciplinary work can be leveraged in human-computer interaction, robotics, and technologies with social-emotional intelligence. The research will also provide investigators with a new tool to study nonverbal communication outside of laboratory settings. <br/><br/>This project brings together the overlapping and converging goals and challenges of autism research and affective computing, both already interdisciplinary in nature, and demonstrates how a collaboration could lead to several mutually beneficial outcomes ? from developing new tools to assist people with ASD in understanding and functioning in the social-emotional world, to developing new computational models and theories that enable technology to provide an overall better experience to those who use it. This work also promotes the training and education of students and people with ASD by involving them in cutting-edge scientific research.

0717685	A Model for Incorporating Application-Based Service Learning in the Undergraduate Science Curriculum	DUE	S-STEM:SCHLR SCI TECH ENG&MATH, CCLI-Type 2 (Expansion)	09/01/2007	08/02/2007	Nancy Trun	PA	Duquesne University	Standard Grant	Terry S. Woodin	11/30/2010	$205,969.00	Lisa Ludvico, Becky Morrow	trun@duq.edu	Room 310 Administration Building	Pittsburgh	PA	152820001	4123961537	EHR	1536, 7492	9178, SMET	$0.00	This project represents a novel approach (Application-Based Service Learning, ABSL) to STEM education, an approach that uses service learning and community based problems to teach students modern scientific methods and to enhance their involvement in and understanding of scientific concepts as well as provide a service to the community. Through projects in a variety of courses, a unique combination of PIs, a veterinarian, microbiologist, and animal behaviorist/forensic scientist, are helping undergraduate students investigate the environmental impacts, social hierarchies, disease transmission, and public health risks of feral cats in the Pittsburgh area. The techniques involved include DNA extraction, PCR, cloning, DNA sequencing, genotyping, gel electrophoresis. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: Students learn about the specific community problem being studied in the service portion of the class. They then conduct novel research in laboratory classes or carry out specific projects in lecture based classes to help solve or understand the biology of the community problem. The project completes the integration of ABSL into the Biology curriculum in multiple courses at Duquesne University. The model has been successfully piloted in several classes by the PIs since January 2006, leading to some confidence in its intellectual potential. Assessment is being conducted via pre and post testing and longitudinal study of the students involved compared to students not engaged in the ABSL courses, thus adding information concerning application of this method to the knowledge base in undergraduate education in the biological sciences.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The project is resulting in development of the ABSL pilot model to make it more generally applicable to a variety of biology courses and to the gathering of materials for a manual describing effective techniques for ABSL and an open source web-site, disseminating the manual and other information generated by the students. In addition other institutions (Lehigh Carbon Community College, La Roche University and National Aviary in Pittsburgh) are being introduced to ABSL by their participation as partners in this project. Due to its real world significance, the project appeals to students that may not otherwise participate in a research project. In addition, the project enhances infrastructure at several levels. Students from multiple courses are interacting, including non-science majors with diverse backgrounds. This provides opportunities for sharing different knowledge bases and skill sets. The networking occurring between multiple departments and universities strengthens interdisciplinary education and leads to greater enhancement of STEM teaching and learning. The community partnerships being developed are generating opportunities for students to gain a better sense of social responsibility and accountability and to obtain first hand knowledge on how to go about solving a community problem.
0737883	SGER: Exploiting Anomalous Diffusion at Polymorphic Transitions for Large Ingress of Elements and Deeper Surface Coatings in Metals	DMR	METAL & METALLIC NANOSTRUCTURE	08/15/2007	07/09/2008	K. S. Ravi Chandran	UT	University of Utah	Continuing grant	Alan J. Ardell	07/31/2009	$168,340.00		ravi.chandran@utah.edu	75 S 2000 E	SALT LAKE CITY	UT	841128930	8015816903	MPS	1771	9161, 7237, 9237, AMPP	$0.00	TECHNICAL: In this high risk/high payoff, transformative project, PI will explore the interesting possibility of pumping a large amount of elements by exploiting the anomalous diffusion at polymorphic transitions, to achieve deep and enriched surface layers/coatings in metals. This idea has been triggered by PI's recent observations during B diffusion in titanium where an unusual and interesting result was found. Nanostructured titanium boride (TiB) whiskers exhibited an unusually deeper growth into titanium substrate, when diffusion occurred close to the polymorphic transition temperature. Although this might appear strange at first, there is some convincing and indirect evidence supporting this phenomenon. Anomalous (fast) diffusion in metals has been noted near polymorphic transitions of metals leading to a curvature in Arrhenius-plot of diffusion coefficient. Due to the lattice instability accompanying the phase transition, this is speculated to trigger huge atomic flux, pumping-in lot of species (such as C, B, N, O) from surface to interior. Except for PI's preliminary evidence, none of these have been demonstrated conclusively. The broad intellectual question that will be resolved in this research is what happens when interstitial elements, C, B, N, O are diffused into metals, near or exactly at the polymorphic transition temperatures, and how this unusual process can be understood from atomic/kinetic point of view. PI will explore this aspect, both experimentally and theoretically, in two candidate materials, Ti and Fe during solid/vapor state diffusion of B, C, N at polymorphic transitions. NON-TECHNICAL: If this anomalously deeper diffusion of species in metals is confirmed across major classes of metals (such as Fe, Ti, Zr, Co) that undergo polymorphic transitions, then this would have a great impact in surface science and engineering (high payoff, transformative elements). One can then exploit this phenomenon for solid state diffusion of elements (C, N, B, O) to form deep and enriched surface hard coatings (carbides, borides and nitrides) on metals. In particular, Fe and Ti are prime candidates as these metals are commonly carburized, nitrided or borided to increase surface hardness and wear resistance--the anomalous diffusion at the polymorphic transition temperature can be taken advantage of here, in producing deeper and more enriched surface layers at much less time and energy cost. Demonstration of large ingress of interstitials in Ti and Fe and the attendant achievement of deeper coating and hardening should revolutionize the surface treatment industry - a large number of gears, bearings, tools, dies and other components are routinely surface hardened to increase hardness and wear resistance. Performing these processes at or near phase transition temperatures and at shorter times should lead to large energy/cost savings in industry. This research will employ one undergraduate student and one graduate student (minority or under-represented-group candidate if available).
0716290	Collaborative Research: Evaluating student learning in geoscience curricula that employ conceptests using electronic student response systems	DUE	CCLI-Type 2 (Expansion), S-STEM:SCHLR SCI TECH ENG&MATH	08/01/2007	08/02/2007	Ann Holmes	TN	University of Tennessee Chattanooga	Standard Grant	Peter Lea	07/31/2012	$35,746.00		Ann-Holmes@utc.edu	615 McCallie Avenue	Chattanooga	TN	374032504	4234254431	EHR	7492, 1536	9150, 9178, SMET	$0.00	Geology (42)<br/><br/><br/>We are exploring the impact of using electronic student response systems to facilitate learning in large introductory geoscience courses across the country. Students are provided a personally registered remote control that is used to answer conceptual questions during the actual class. The questions are text-, diagram- or graph-based multiple choice questions that focus on one key concept. They are intended to reinforce material presented in class. They provide immediate feedback to students as class responses are collected in near-real time and displayed on a graph at the front of the classroom. Students and instructors analyze the graphs, discuss the results and use that information to guide subsequent activities. Small group discussion of class responses is the primary mode of instruction. We are analyzing over 9000 student responses to identify questions that can be used as reliable in-class assessments at other institutions. Teaching and learning aids are also being developed to help students identify ways to better prepare for class so that they are successful in and out of class. We are varying the types of questions, amounts of response data students see and questioning techniques to determine which combinations provide the richest learning experiences. Data are being collected in six different states at community colleges, four-year colleges and research universities. The intellectual merit of this proposal includes analyses of data regarding the utility of using electronic response system and questions across populations, disciplines and educational settings and identification of better ways to ensure a scientifically literate population of non-science majors. The broader impact of this proposal includes the thorough study and documentation of student response to these questions by gender and ethnicity. Such documentation is leading to recommendations for how faculty can employ such assessments in the most inclusive way possible.

However, some important estuarine chemical fluxes and processes amongst them the flux of material from shelf bottom waters up into brackish surface waters and the flux of regenerated material off-shelf in bottom waters remain poorly understood. <br/><br/>Scientists from the University of Southern Mississippi, the University of South Alabama, and the University of South Florida would determine the distributions of nutrients, trace elements, radium isotopes and other tracers in the outflow of the Mississippi River to (1) to constrain water, nutrient and trace element fluxes; (2) to compare chemical distributions in different distributary mixing zones of an estuarine system to see how physiographic differences affect chemical fluxes; (3) to examine physical-chemical speciation of trace elements in a river plume/estuary mixing zone to see how sources and sinks of the trace elements are reflected in the speciation; and (4) to further develop and apply radium tracer methodology to these problems. Results of the field work would be incorporated into mass balance models of the Mississippi River outflow system to provide a more quantitative and systematic estimate of material fluxes. <br/><br/>As regards broader impacts, this study would further our understanding of transport and cycling of nutrients and trace elements in river-dominated coastal systems. Understanding the fluxes of these elements in coastal and estuarine systems would allow for the development of management models and scenarios to predict the effect of management policies on the chemical and biological health of the coastal zone. This study would help foster new inter-institutional collaborations with two new investigators. Two graduate students from the University of Southern Mississippi, one graduate student from the University of South Alabama, and one graduate student and two undergraduate students from the University of South Florida would be supported and trained as part of this project.

The instrumentation's ability to image molecular complexes and to measure (un-) binding forces will allow USP investigators from different disciplines to study various types of molecular interactions. The projects include (a) the influence of RNA-RNA and RNA-protein interactions in dissecting viral and sub-viral replication complex assembly (b) steric interactions of polymer coated colloidal particles in transport and aggregation processes (c) interactions among the topoisomerases and helicases in Bacillus anthracis and the catalytic mechanisms of these enzymes (d) interaction between epithelial cells and their underlying substratum. The AFM high resolution will allow studies of physical and chemical properties of micro- and nano- structures. These include (a) studies of electrical isolation and physical properties of patterned micro- and nano- scale areas in Silicon and AlGaAs/GaAs (b) visualization of successful MALDI spots to study of the influence of sample preparation on the detection of oligonucleotide complexes. The AFM instrumentation will create a unique opportunity for students to participate in interdisciplinary research and educational activities as well as to nurture the development of the new USP program in biophysics and materials science. With the robust involvement of undergraduate and graduate students in research at USP this instrumentation will help the University to attract more minority students through its outreach programs for K-12 Philadelphia schools.<br/><br/>Lay Abstract<br/>The Atomic Force Microscope is an essential modern tool for imaging nanostructures' objects thousands of times smaller than the diameter of a hair and for measuring the delicate forces between molecules. These forces play an important role in fundamental processes occurring in physical and biological systems. The acquisition of an Atomic Force Microscope by the University of the Sciences in Philadelphia (USP) will help its investigators unravel the mechanisms by which molecules of various types interact with each other. Ultimately these studies will lead to a better understanding of how the viruses responsible for diseases such as hepatitis C, influenza and polio replicate, or create copies of themselves. These studies will also help in the comprehension of how small particles, such as contaminants in groundwater systems, move and assemble themselves into aggregates. Another critical application is the study of the structures of microbial enzymes involved in antibiotic resistance. These findings will benefit the design and development of novel antibiotics against anthrax and other lethal infections. Important studies making use of the imaging capability of the instrumentation will investigate the physical properties of patterned nanostructures as a step toward developing the computer technology of tomorrow. In bringing together researchers from chemistry, physics and biology, the diverse uses of the instrumentation will help generate a strong interdisciplinary environment at USP. The exciting possibilities made possible by the acquisition of an Atomic Force Microscope will undoubtedly benefit the students at USP, who will become better educated as future scientists and professionals.

The goals of the project are to (a) improve educational opportunities for students interested in STEM careers; (b) increase student retention to degree achievement; (c) increase the impact of student support for students enrolled in STEM disciplines; and (d) ultimately increase the numbers of well educated and skilled employees in STEM fields. Creating a learning community and providing tools for success are accomplished through project activities. All participants complete a job shadow and/or internship experience during the freshman year and complete a capstone experience during the sophomore year. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: Research-based retention strategies and project activities provide participants with the academic and career exploration support necessary to successfully transfer to a university or transition to the workforce. The project team is partnering with the Institutional Research Office at the college to track similarities and disconnects between participants in the cohort group and a control group. <br/><br/>Broader Impact: The project is developing internship opportunities, job shadow experiences, and capstone activities. National employment demand for two-year degree STEM graduates drives this project, and local industry partners have opportunities for these students. Alignment of curricular competencies and strengthening articulations with neighboring transfer universities provide students pursuing a four-year degree with a seamless transition. Blending academic and support services though project strategies increase retention and serve as a replicable model for other colleges.

On one hand, transboundary ecosystems conservation is related to the coordination of political actors across scales -from the global to the national and local-, as well as across international borders. On the other, contrary to ecological requirements, political and sovereignty concerns have encouraged the concentration of power at specific scales and within national borders. Yet, global environmental governance approaches involving international cooperation along with hybrid forms of governance have blossomed around the world. The effects of combined transboundary-hybrid governance are still poorly understood. <br/><br/>This research thus aims to strengthen environmental policy efforts by contributing to the understanding of how institutional frameworks derived from transboundary-hybrid forms of governance influence the sustainability of natural resources straddling international borders. Additionally, this dissertation research seeks to advance the analytical understanding of the complementary nature of state, global and local actors in the governance and conservation of transboundary natural resources. Through a comparative analysis of the Calakmul-Mayan Transboundary Biosphere Reserve shared by Mexico and Guatemala and La Amistad International Park between Costa Rica and Panama, this research seeks to answer 1) how states, global actors and local communities engage in transboundary-hybrid forms of governance, 2) how transboundary-hybrid forms of governance have favored or hindered conservation and 3) what types of hybrid- governance are more conducive to the conservation of transboundary natural resources of biologically diverse regions in developing countries. To answer these questions statistical models will be built and tested, as well as complemented with qualitative analysis of the two Transboundary Protected Areas (TBPAs) case studies. Data will be collected from eighty communities from the two TBPAs through surveys and semi-structured interviews of households, local organizations, as well as national and international government and non governmental organizations.

Dendrimer disassembly relies on a single triggering event to initiate<br/>multiple cleavages throughout a dendritic structure that result in release of individual dendrimer subunits or larger dendrimer fragments. The potential of this process lies in the nature of dendrimers as covalent assemblages of active species, and using the chemistry of disassembly to release these species into a system. Further advantages include the role of dendritic components of a system in influencing solubility, energy harvesting, or insulating capabilities, and using the chemistry of disassembly to reverse<br/> those contributions to a system. The proposed work presents a systematic, four-part research plan to further develop dendrimer disassembly technology. First will be the design and implementation new synthetic strategies for preparing disassembling dendritic structures in a more efficient and higher yielding fashion. Second, new disassembling structures based on fundamentally different dendrimer subunits will be prepared. Third, controlled disassembly and subunit trapping studies will be used to assay the capability and reactivity of these new systems. And fourth, new effective implementations of disassembling structures as application of their unique reactivity will be initiated.<br/><br/>With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports Dominic McGrath of the University of Arizona whose research will result in the further development of an entirely new concept in nanotechnology, dendrimer disassembly. Materials prepared as part of this research plan will (a) be useful for traditional polymer degradation technologies, and (b) have potential enhanced capabilities in nanotechnology, biomedicine, and sensor technology. Since this research program is a coherent combination of molecular design, synthesis, and characterization, with important considerations of organic reactivity, students will obtain a broad array of experiences in the larger area of materials chemistry. Hence, this research is ideally suited to the education of graduate, postdoctoral, as well as undergraduate students. In fact, undergraduates in Professor McGrath's group have made several significant advances in the previous project period, which will be enhanced in this project period by the investigation of applications of dendrimer disassembly. These applications are interdisciplinary in nature, and interdisciplinary research provides a unique training environment for undergraduates and graduate students.

A Beckman Coulter laser diffractometer with the capability for rapid and repeatable determination of grain size distributions in suspensions of sand to clay sized fractions will be acquired. A group of five PIs and their students will use the laser diffractometer for grain size analysis in support of a range of research in sedimentology, carbon cycling, marine stratigraphy, animal-sediment interactions, hydrology and geochemistry.  Marine and lacustrine sediments and soils provide a record of past environmental conditions, are important reservoirs in the global carbon cycle, and host a great variety of life forms from bacteria to macrofauna, whose biogeochemical activity controls the fate and transport of naturally occurring and anthropogenic organic and inorganic species.  Grain size distributions can reveal a great deal about transport processes and when coupled with other geochemical proxies, provide insight to provenance, paleoenvironmental conditions and diagenetic processes. The laser diffractometer will support improved educational opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students at NCSU.  Faculty and student biogeochemical and paleoenvironmental research at NCSU has implications for understanding and reacting to global climate change and for pollutant remediation.<br/><br/><br/>

It asks: How is democracy fostered or made elusive in refugee camps? Refugee camps exist in the shadow of weak international law. Despite its early promise, refugee aid policy had become leached of its initial rights-based mandate by the end of the 20th century. The refugee camps, an amalgam of charity and disciplinary social control, emerged as emblematic of the new order. But political practices persist even in the midst of political exclusion democracy persists in complex ways. Funding is requested for twelve months of fieldwork to compare the experiences of two groups of Liberian refugees in Ghana: camp refugees living in the Buduburam Refugee Settlement and town refugees trying to assimilate in the capital city of Accra.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit<br/><br/>This dissertation unites two research traditions often treated as unrelated, democracy studies and refugee studies, to contribute to three research concerns: (1) Democracy in the midst of political exclusion: How does being excluded from political participation shape democratic practices? (2) Civic engagement in post-conflict settings: How do survivors of violent conflicts re-engage (or not) with government and non-governmental institutions? (3) Implementing international human rights law: What are the consequences for democratic sensibilities when human rights are proclaimed, while political autonomy is curtailed?<br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/><br/>In 1999, the United States and others sponsored post-conflict elections in Liberia. The elections failed, and war reignited. Evaluating the failed elections, Kamara (1999) cited a general absence of practical knowledge about democracy. Testifying to the wide relevance of these challenges, when USAID launched its first major evaluation of post-conflict elections, it analyzed the merits of different voter education programs. In Liberia like elsewhere returning refugees will shape the emerging political landscape. People undergo vast shifts in patterns of social life in refugee camps, learning customs that will serve them well or poorly in other settings. It can be a time of growth or corruption. What refugees learn of civic engagement matters for democratic transitions because democracy needs civic habits to flourish. U.S. policymakers treat democracy aid as a crucial part of post-conflict reconstruction. By exploring the role of refugee aid, this research enhances our understanding of democratization programs rooted in refugee life experiences.
0720429	Sustaining Motivation Under Threat	BCS	SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY	09/01/2007	06/25/2008	David Sherman	CA	University of California-Santa Barbara	Standard Grant	Kellina Craig-Henderson	08/31/2010	$165,000.00		david.sherman@psych.ucsb.edu	Office of Research	Santa Barbara	CA	931062050	8058934188	SBE	1332	0000, OTHR, 9178, 9251, SMET	$0.00	The under-representation of minorities in academic institutions is a persistent social problem. One social psychological explanation for this chronic situation is that individuals in minority groups face the additional psychological burden of stereotype threat; that is, they must contend with negative stereotypes about their group that can hamper their performance and lead to disidentification from academic domains. In past social psychological research, self-affirmation has been shown to attenuate this stereotype threat. The present research seeks to explore the underlying mechanisms of how and why self-affirmation attenuates stereotype threat and improves academic performance. The basic premise of this proposal is that when dealing with a stressor, people must not only contend with solving the problem at hand, but additionally, they must also deal with the broader psychological implications of success and failure for their self-evaluation. These additional psychological concerns, exacerbated when an individual is a member of a negatively stereotyped group, can be attenuated when alternative self-resources are affirmed through the process of self-affirmation. To examine the dynamic nature of how individuals sustain motivation under threat, a field study is proposed with children in a middle school composed of students of varying races and ethnicities. The field study will feature: 1) a self-affirmation intervention that has been demonstrated to reduce stereotype threat and improve performance in similar settings; 2) the repeated measurement of potential mediators including daily perceptions of stereotype threat, collective threat, self-esteem, collective self-esteem, academic identification and self-efficacy; 3) the observation of academic performance (i.e., classroom quizzes and examinations). It is proposed that self-affirmation can lead to improved academic performance among stereotype threatened individuals by buffering self-worth against daily stressors and stereotype threat. By utilizing repeated measurements of potential mediators, this research will examine on a within-person level whether days in which students perceive stereotype threat are associated with reductions in self-esteem and academic motivation, and whether self-affirmation can attenuate this link between perceptions of stereotype threat and self-evaluation. The goal of this research is to explore and better understand how drawing on alternative self-resources can enable individuals to maintain motivation and improve performance in the face of negative group stereotypes and psychological threat more generally. The present research has the potential to benefit educational practices by elucidating the mechanisms by which stereotype threat can be reduced and academic motivation sustained.

Specifically, the instruments will enhance the oceanographic observing component of the nascent Arctic Observing Network. <br/><br/>The instrumentation to be acquired includes: Moored Profilers; Upward-looking Sonars; Bottom Pressure Recorders; Ice-tethered Profilers; Polar Profiling Floats; and Arctic Winch Profilers. These instruments will be managed by the Physical Oceanographic Observing Laboratory (POOL) at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, and will be available to the broader Arctic oceanography community. Data returned from these instruments will support studies of ocean processes, facilitate numerical model initialization and validation, and stimulate general interest in Arctic issues. Research and understanding that builds on these the data acquired by these instruments will lead to a better appreciation of the role of the Arctic in the Earth's climate system. <br/><br/>An international partnership with projects in Canada, France, Germany, Norway, Russia, Sweden and the United Kingdom) will provide broad spatial coverage of the Arctic Ocean during IPY. The addition of these instruments to the Arctic Observing Network, the data they obtain, and the knowledge and understanding that will result, will be an important contribution to the legacy of the International Polar Year. Data and information about the instruments and the science will be available at the Polar Discovery Web site (http://polardiscovery.whoi.edu), and communicated more broadly through a collaboration with the NSF-funded IPY education project Live from the Poles (ESI-0632219).

The research questions are:<br/><br/>*What constitutes a learning progression in inquiry that builds toward a conceptual understanding of energy? And how can instruction help?<br/><br/>*What constitutes teachers' progression in their abilities to facilitate scientific inquiry? What scaffolding, instructional activities, and professional development activities support teachers' movement along this progression?<br/><br/>The work is conducted by research teams from San Diego State University and the University of Maryland. Energy will be treated through concepts in the physical sciences in grade 4, the life sciences in grade 5 and earth science in grade 6. <br/><br/>The research will focus on coding students' reasoning about energy concepts by identifying levels of sophistication in argumentation and on their progress in conceptual understanding of energy. The project studies teacher learning through analysis of video data from the professional development sessions, and the degree to which teachers modify instructional practice along with their assessment practices.

The research <br/>shows that in the Bayesian framework, unlabeled data should be used to construct a prior for the purpose of improving predictive learning. More generally, the investigator considers the problem of constructing priors and learning predictive structures on hypothesis spaces from unlabeled data. Under this unified framework, the investigator systematically studies theoretical and algorithmic consequences of semi-supervised learning. <br/><br/>Statistical machine learning is concerned with building computer systems that can predict unobserved information (labels) based on observed information (data). For example, to predict whether a patient has cancer (label) based on blood test (data). Traditionally, a statistical machine learning algorithm builds prediction rules from a set of labeled data. One of the most important issues in practical applications of statistical machine learning is whether one can improve the performance of a learning algorithm by using unlabeled data. This is because unlabeled data are generally abundant while their labels are very costly to obtain. Methods that use both labeled and unlabeled data are generally referred to as semi-supervised learning. This research attempts to establish a general statistical theory for semi-supervised learning, and applies the theory to improve state of the art machine learning algorithms.

Such applications, and countless others, would require a high quality haptic device for the hands through which realistic forces could be applied to convincingly simulate touch. Today's haptic interfaces - information technology that supports human touching and manipulation of virtual or remote objects - are still in their infancy compared to human haptic capabilities. The typical haptic device is connected to a single finger, or supports interaction through a pen-like stylus. In an effort to dramatically advance the state of the art, the PI has developed an exciting prototype multi-finger device of high resolution and bandwidth. In this project he will determine the limits of the prototype and refine the technology so that it is useful for evaluation in applications. To these ends, the PI will explore the requirements on high-fidelity haptic technology imposed by human perception. He will measure user thresholds {i.e., the smallest forces which they can perceive with multiple fingers), and will study multi-finger and bi-manual behavior and performance in exploring and manipulating objects and materials. These data will enable the PI to reconfigure his multi-finger haptic device and create software modifications as necessary, and also to develop a new haptic rendering algorithm and study how it interacts with human perception. Project outcomes will include engineering requirements for successful yet cost-effective haptic devices, along with some of the knowledge necessary to achieve future high quality multi-finger haptic interface applications<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The technology to be developed in this project will ultimately give people who are visually impaired access to the many images and 3D datasets and models which are accessible only in electronic form. Additionally, haptics is an important enabling technology for medical simulations; better medical simulators will lead to fewer medical errors and more efficient training of medical personnel. Haptics is expected to have a significant impact on the appreciation and the conservation of works of art. Demonstrations of applications in these and other fields will be byproducts of this research.

The approach is to develop both microfluidic operations for sample collection and preparation and quantum dots-based nanosensors for identification of pathogens according to their ribosomal RNA sequences. The microfluidic unit and the nanosensor unit will be integrated into a system whose performance will be exemplified through analysis of Bacillus spores.<br/> The use of the droplet-based microfluidic operations will minimize the requirement of liquid volume and avoid the need for building moving components on the chip for sample processing that both reduces the consumption of biochemical reagents and the complexity in constructing an integrated microfluidic processing system. The highly sensitive rRNA nanosensors will eliminate the need for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification, thereby simplifying assay protocols and system integration. <br/>This sensing system will have broader impacts with the societal benefits including (i) immediate detection of bio-warfare pathogens such as anthrax to prevent their possible catastrophe and (ii) surveillance of environments in, for example, transportation infrastructures, healthcare buildings, and workplaces. Besides, this research will also have significant impacts on education by (i) establishing micro/nano scientific visual library on web based on the research outcome; (ii) developing micro/nano science coursework with a lab session; and (iii) having undergraduates especially from the underrepresented groups to participate in the research activities.

Smooth and efficient memory thermal management schemes must be developed to meet the challenge. There also lack memory thermal models and simulation tools in the public domain for research and education. This project proposes memory thermal models and thermal simulators for DRAM memory subsystems as well as efficient DTM (dynamic thermal management) methods. The investigators develop a simple and accurate dynamic thermal model based on fully buffered DIMM and an accurate and fast two-level simulator estimating the thermal behavior of a memory subsystem. They also study several new, system-level DTM schemes that coordinate DRAM thermal management with processor performance throttling. Several new DTM methods are to be developed. The first method, Adaptive Core Gating, adjusts the number of active cores according to the memory thermal status.<br/>The second method, Coordinated DVFS (dynamic voltage and frequency scaling), proactively scales down the processor frequency and voltage upon memory thermal emergency, reducing both the DRAM heat generation and the processor power consumption. Furthermore, thermal-aware OS job scheduling smoothes memory traffic and DRAM heat generation by mixing jobs with different memory demands appropriately. The thermal model is validated to execution on hardware platforms; and the proposed methods are evaluated on real systems.

Castner and his research group will study the physical and chemical properties of new classes of ionic liquids. Time-resolved optical spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy will be used to study the dynamics, interactions, and transport in ionic liquids as a function of temperature. The research will include the detailed evaluation of the impact of silicon substitutions in alkyl side chains on the properties of these materials and the comparison of intermolecular interactions in ionic liquids with those of isoelectronic, neutral homologs. NMR diffusion studies of ionic liquids with varying concentrations of water will be used to model transport relevant to ionic liquids in fuel cells. The overall goal of the work is to study carefully selected ionic liquids and model systems in sufficient detail to lead to better a priori predictions of their properties. <br/><br/>The research should provide a better understanding of the liquid properties of ionic liquids, especially their viscosities and conductivities. Ionic liquids are an important new class of chemical solvents comprised of molten salts that have many special properties. The unique electrical characteristics of these liquids should lead to their use in improved batteries, fuel cells and solar photocells. The Castner group will collaborate with a diverse range of researchers, including students, postdoctoral fellows, faculty, and scientific staff at Brookhaven National Laboratory, William Paterson University, and the City University of New York (Hunter College and Brooklyn College). The project will train undergraduates, graduate students, and post-doctoral researchers in modern techniques in experimental and theoretical physical chemistry.

Correctness is a fundamental concern for microprocessors: all software applications implicitly assume correct operation of the processor. As demonstrated by the infamous Pentium division bug, the cost of bugs in the final system is prohibitive. Validating these complex designs is a real challenge. Current practice of extensive simulation for design validation is inadequate as it can only exercise a small portion of the state space, leaving many key properties unchecked.<br/><br/>This research applies techniques from formal verification to verifying the correctness of higher-level models of complex processors. Higher level processor models written in programming languages like C, C++, or SystemC, are becoming more and more prevalent as golden reference models for subsequent hardware implementations. While hardware and processor verification have been an active area of research, the novelty of this research is to merge the high-level design structure and powerful automated abstraction techniques developed in software verification (such as Predicate Abstraction, Shape Analysis, and Atomicity) with the insights from hardware verification (such as proof decomposition and memory abstraction). Instead of the usual bit-level models used in hardware verification, the combined techniques are likely to produce more compact models, helping the reasoning to scale to large systems, such as the complete description of a modern microarchitecture.<br/><br/>The research will tie in with the investigators' educational objectives of developing graduate level courses that combine the principles of formal verification with the principles of reliable system design.<br/><br/>

Given the status of ongoing projects and the timetable of planned construction/upgrades, it is expected that a priority will be given to evaluating future needs and opportunities that could take advantage of unique characteristics that will be made available at NSLS II and as a result of the upgrade at the APS. However, identification of other needs, including those relating to other SR facilities, will also be addressed. A final product of the workshop will be a written report for publication that would document needs in the context of existing SR facilities throughout the US. It is expected that this report would provide sound guidance for proposed MES and geochemistry priorities at NSLS II, the APS, and elsewhere. The workshop is also expected to catalyze exchanges of ideas that could lead to partnerships to secure funding for development of new end stations. It will also serve to inform directors of SR facilities of user needs. The findings will further provide program managers of funding agencies with a current evaluation of future research directions in MES and geochemistry.

In the United States alone, over 10,000 such regulations can be found in financial, life sciences, health-care and government sectors, including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, and Sarbanes-Oxley Act. A recurrent theme in these regulations is the need for regulatory-compliant storage as an underpinning to ensure data confidentiality, access integrity and authentication; provide audit trails, guaranteed deletion, and data migration; and deliver Write Once Read Many<br/>(WORM) assurances, essential for enforcing long-term data retention and life-cycle policies.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, current compliance storage WORM mechanisms are fundamentally vulnerable to faulty behavior or insiders with incentives to alter stored data because they rely on simple enforcement primitives such as software and/or hardware device-hosted on/off switches, ill-suited to their target threat model.<br/><br/>In this project, we will build a strongly compliant storage system for realistic adversarial settings, delivering guaranteed document retention and deletion, quick lookup, and compliant migration, together with support for litigation holds and several key aspects of data confidentiality.<br/><br/>Recent compliance regulations are intended to foster and restore humans trust in digital information records and, more broadly, in our businesses, hospitals, and educational enterprises. As increasing amounts of information are created and live digitally, compliance storage will be a vital tool in restoring this trust and ferreting out corruption and data abuse at all levels of society. This project will greatly advance the state of the art and create a strong foundation for secure regulatory compliant designs.

The role of sensor morphology in detecting fluid signals.<br/><br/>Copepods present a spectacular diversity of antennule and setal morphologies, orientations and degree of ornamentation. The causes and consequences of this diversity remain unexplored, but the staggering degree of morphological variation suggests structure-function relationships between mechanosensor properties and their sensory roles. Using copepods as a model system, this work will address the relationship between the shape of mechanosensory structures and their movement under non steady-state fluid conditions. Planktonic copepods provide a unique model system for mechanoreception because: 1) copepods show a variety of behavioral responses to fluid signals; 2) the basic properties of copepod's mechanosensory systems are easy to identify and are likely conserved across a diverse range of species; 3) because of their size, copepods operate at low Reynolds numbers where fluid motion remains comparatively coherent and easy to quantify and model. Also, one of the truly unique characteristics of copepods is their extremely rapid response times (milliseconds). Living at low Reynolds numbers, mechanical stimuli are attenuated quickly by viscous dampening causing fluid velocity (driven by steady swimming) to decrease with distance squared (Fields and Yen 2002). Consequently, copepods often do not detect other individuals (including predators) until they are within a few body lengths of each other. Because of the close proximity and their ability for rapid movement, behavioral latencies of milliseconds are required. Collecting enough information within this short latency period is an extraordinary challenge for the copepod and requires rapid firing rates and the spatial integration of numerous signals from their antennae.<br/>To determine the relationship between fluid motion, setal motion, nerve firing rates and behavior, the dynamics of all components must be simultaneously known. Using analytical solutions for monopole or dipole movement, previous studies have calculated what the fluid characteristics should be at the sensor under steady state conditions. However, the mechanical devises generating the fluid signals and the sensor responding to the signal require 100 - 1000 ms to reach steady state. Yet it is during these crucial first few milliseconds that copepods (or any other organism with short behavioral latency) gather the pertinent information. Therefore steady state solutions are appropriate for organisms that integrate information over long time periods but are not applicable for organisms such as copepods with short behavioral latencies. Numerical treatments for quantifying fluid motion are available but rarely applied. A second consideration is how the receptors are modeled. Due primarily to analytical tractability, most current models of setal motion characterize the hair as a rigid cylinder of uniform diameter and rely on spatially homogeneous-steady state flow over the entire hair to move it. However, anatomical features, such as non-uniform cuticular thickness, asymmetry in cross-sectional diameter, setal geniculations and fine hair-like projections from the setae differ between seta and likely affect the transduction of fluid motion to setal bending. Furthermore, mechanical features such as the degree of setal arcing may give rise to large changes in the relationship between angular deflection and fluid velocity. For setae immersed in water, as opposed to air (where many of the models have been applied) these effects may be even more pronounced.<br/>The goal of this project is to quantify the relationship between fluid motion and sensory morphology. SEM measurements of the size and width of different setae and TEM measurements of cuticular thickness and the extent of the dendritic penetration up the shaft of individual mechanoreceptors will be made for three species of copepods. The force required to bend the seta and the physiological response of individual hairs to the well described flows created in the lab will be quantified with respect to the physical characteristics of the receptor. The empirical data will be used to build two interacting models: Finite Element Method (FEM) and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). The FEM will be used to model the motion of individual seta with known morphology and bending characteristics while the CFD will be used to calculate the hydrodynamic force and torque applied to each region of the seta and the influence of the seta on the surrounding flow. These data are fundamental to understanding how these small, neurologically simple organisms can distinguish from the myriad of biologically and physically induced fluid movements.

The investigators in this collaborative research program will study flame spray pyrolysis (FSP) numerically as a means of manufacturing doped metal-oxide nanoparticles, developing a predictive modeling tool. <br/><br/>The project involves several elements - turbulent flame, spray dynamics, pyrolysis reaction and their mutual interactions and five institutions the University of Texas Austin, Iowa State University, Ames Research Laboratory, Millennium Inorganic Chemicals, Inc., and the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETH Zurich). Five sub-tasks (chemical mechanism, particle evolution, flame/particle interaction, model validation and data access tool) are divided among the three lead investigators. The participants will interact through a cyberinfrastructure collaboratory that has intellectually interesting elements in itself. <br/><br/>The proposed model will use a unified Large Eddy Simulation / Filtered Density Function approach with a goal of optimizing FSP production routes for manufacture of doped zirconia and titanium dioxide nanoparticles, specifically prediction of final particle size distribution in FSP reactors. The filtered density function concept is a very promising approach to combustion LES, and the proposed work is an excellent example of complementary studies.<br/><br/>The success of this project is also expected to have a significant impact on combustion-turbulence modeling, applicable to fields such as fire dynamics and soot modeling, and to expand understanding in an area where the research can benefit many diverse technological disciplines. <br/><br/>Research results will be integrated into graduate and undergraduate curricula, and the project will train graduate and undergraduate research students. Recruitment of women and under-represented minority is a goal in both institutions, leveraging university assets for recruitment and employment of students from traditionally underrepresented groups.

Mass evacuations are among the most difficult problem areas in Transportation Science because they violate key assumptions underlying traditional theories, e.g., Wardrop equilibrium among selfish commuters. A key challenge in this domain is to develop an understanding of non-equilibrium traffic dynamics over transportation networks to aid in the design of emergency traffic management techniques. This is a formidable task due to the data-intensive nature of the problem, and the semantic gap between current database management systems and transportation science. The goal of this project is to research novel and scalable data management concepts in partnership with the development of novel transportation science models and theories to understand emergency traffic. New collaborative computer science research is proposed to probe innovative database concepts underlying network non-equilibrium dynamics data and queries.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit<br/>These approaches to time-variant graphs and spatio-temporal database support for flow networks significantly differ from the traditional approaches in the database literature. Th project is expected to create innovations in the following areas: 1) graph-aggregates, a novel representation of time-varying graphs, 2) database support for flow network operations, e.g. min-cut, and max-flow, 3) the proposed database concepts will be designed and evaluated in collaboration with domain scientists and professionals using grand challenge problems (e.g., emergency traffic management) and datasets (e.g. large urban evacuation scenarios, population distributions, and flow networks). The hope is to significantly enhance scientists' ability to understand and manage non-equilibrium network behavior, not only in Transportation Science, but also in many other important domains including logistics, telecommunication networks, electric power grids, and distribution networks for gas, water, etc. <br/><br/>Broader Impact<br/>Teaching materials (e.g., slides, software prototypes) to facilitate incorporation of research results in courses and classroom activities will be prepared. This project will broaden the participation of underrepresented groups at many levels: one PI has a track record of participation in summer institutes involving undergraduate students from historically black colleges and universities. If successful, the results wil benefit society by reducing evacuation time, which may save lives and reduce exposure of vulnerable populations in the face of man-made and/or natural disasters.
0720343	Support for Conferences and Mentoring Activities in Political Methodology	SES	METHOD, MEASURE & STATS, POLITICAL SCIENCE	08/15/2007	04/02/2010	Philip Schrodt	KS	University of Kansas Center for Research Inc	Standard Grant	Brian D.

Part 1 extends the NSF co-sponsorship in place since 1986. Parts 2 and 3 are new initiatives taken in response to the larger, more inclusive format we have adopted for future summer meetings and the need to take pro-active measures to recruit and retain women in the field. <br/><br/>For the past several years, the summer methods meetings have been so successful that many interested faculty and graduate students have had to be turned away. In an effort to broaden and diversify the meetings-and the subfield-the Political Methodology Section has voted to expand the meetings substantially. The funding requested here will be used exclusively to subsidize the participation of graduate students, women, minorities, and otherwise unfunded assistant professors in these new, larger meetings. <br/><br/>Intellectual merit: The annual political methodology summer meetings provide a forum where state of the art political methodology can be presented, discussed, and advanced. They provide a venue in which graduate students and junior faculty can meet colleagues from other institutions; receive state of the art training, advice on specific research problems, and mentoring; and be inspired to contribute to the further development of the field. <br/><br/>The proposed smaller conferences on specific methodological topics and the women''s political methodology conferences will provide opportunities for scientific advancement and professional mentoring on an intimate scale reminiscent of the original annual meetings of 25 years ago. These are a response to concerns about the increasing size of the annual political methodology meeting and the need for proactive measures to improve the representation of women in the field. <br/><br/>Broader impacts: Quantitative political analysis, expressed in such activities as opinion polling, election forecasting, prospective and retrospective policy assessment, and conflict forecasting, has become a core activity in the functioning of industrialized democracies. Rapid advances in information technology such the rapid, low-cost acquisition of information through the World Wide Web, and the ability to process that information with computationally-intensive methods, has in a short period of time revolutionized our ability to systematically analyze political behavior. The field of political methodology has a central role in understanding and guiding politics. <br/><br/>With this proposal, we also aim to increase the involvement of women (faculty and graduate students) in scientific activities. The women''s mentoring activities we are proposing to fund are intended to create networks and opportunities, as well as to plug the leaky pipeline for women in the field of political methodology where women are under-represented in the field by about a factor of two. These new initiatives implement recommendations from the recent National Academy of Sciences reports, the APSA Workshop on the Advancement of Women in Academic Political Science, and our internal Granato Long Range Strategic Planning Report.

A total of 5 objectives are stated for this proposal: (1) Expand an existing cell-scale model to include intracellular signaling and extra-cellular transport, (2) Couple a vascular-scale and cellular-scale model, (3) Develop a vascular network-scale model of NO transport, (4) Extend the model to a tissue level scale, and (5) Validate the theoretical simulations with in vitro and in vivo studies. The transport and metabolism of NO plays an important role in many normal and pathological tissue functions. As a result, this study could make important contributions to medicine and vascular physiology in general. The coupling of hemodynamics, multiple chemical reactions, and biophysical processes in an integrated multi-scale model is central to a vast number of important physiological and pathophysiological processes.<br/><br/>The coupling of the proposed research with existing courses and other education components is a strength of this proposal. In particular, including this work in cellular biomechanics, tissue engineering, and cardiovascular engineering course work will give students an opportunity to learn some cutting edge research. The PIs have a track record of including undergraduates in their research programs. Also, multi-scale and multi-temporal methods are becoming more important in biology and physiology. As a result, this work is likely to impact a number of other areas besides NO metabolism.

This dissertation project will produce a grammar of Gumuz as spoken in two locations within Ethiopia, Sirba Abay and Mandura, representing the southern and northern varieties respectively. The resulting grammar will include an extensive description and analysis of both the sound system and the grammatical structures of the language, which may shed light on the relationship of the Gumuz language to other Nilo-Saharan languages. A grammar of Gumuz will add significantly to the scant information available on Nilo-Saharan languages. The research will also address such issues as what role, if any, the social history of the Gumuz people (e.g. enslavement, migrations, interethnic contact) may have had on the development of the Gumuz language.<br/><br/>This research is relevant to the Gumuz people themselves in that it will aid in literature development in their mother tongue as well as provide them with resources on their native language. A detailed description and analysis of the Gumuz language is important for improving the writing system and developing literature in the language. Since 1991, the new Ethiopian political structure of ethnic federalism has recognized the right of nations, nationalities, and peoples to develop their languages for primary education and other functions. The Gumuz people have expressed interest in having Gumuz be a language of instruction in the local schools but, in order for this to be possible, further phonological research must be completed. In conducting the research for this project, various genres of texts will be collected along with phrases and word lists which will be of great interest to the Gumuz people as a record of their language and culture. In addition, a tri-glot dictionary using English, Amharic (a major language of Ethiopia) and Gumuz will be produced and made available to both linguists and the local Gumuz people alike.<br/><br/>This award is co-funded by the Office of International Science and Engineering.

They have already become an integral component of safety critical systems involving aviation, military, telecommunications, and process control applications. Interest in embedded systems is growing further due to the expectation that they will become a key component of many commonplace consumer appliances. Consumers will expect levels of reliability and predictability associated with the very best brands of cars, televisions, and refrigerators. Glitches, crashes, and general erratic behavior of the sort seen with prior generations of consumer PC software products will be unacceptable for these embedded applications. It thus becomes crucial that these embedded software systems satisfy high levels of correctness criteria, well above those of today's large software systems, which are often highly error-prone. This project will engage in research and development of a novel methodology for the systematic development of embedded systems, starting at a high-level property-based specification of system requirements and proceeding in a seamless and rigorous manner towards a running code. Central to the proposed design flow is the utilization of powerful new effective methods for the automatic synthesis of running code from behavioral (i.e., temporal) specifications. This technology will be used in two places: first, in order to determine whether a given property-based specification is realizable. Then, selected modules of the design, whose performance is not critical, will be generated by automatic synthesis. Automatic synthesis can also be used for rapid prototyping of larger portions of the design.<br/><br/>In view of this master plan, the following main research activities are pursued:<br/>(1) development of a formal property-based language for specifying requirements, including behavioral, temporal, and structural constraints; supported by effective algorithms for the analysis of large specifications for consistency and realizability; development of a methodology for the automatic synthesis of an executable specification from the requirements specification language, to be used both for checking the realizability of large specifications, and the automatic construction of selected modules of the design; and (3) development of methods for the verification of the intermediate representations of the systems against requirements, using the techniques of translation validation. The property-based development approach has been recently applied successfully to the derivation of hardware designs. In view of this success, the application to the systematic construction of embedded systems is highly promising. This research pursues the generalization of the specification language to include real-time elements and continuous signals, and extends the synthesis approach to accommodate real-time and hybrid systems. With these capabilities, this project is expected to enable systematic co-design of software/hardware for the construction of embedded systems.
0716291	Collaborative Research: Evaluating student learning in geoscience curricula that employ conceptests using electronic student response systems	DUE	CCLI-Type 2 (Expansion), S-STEM:SCHLR SCI TECH ENG&MATH	08/01/2007	08/02/2007	Jeffrey Knott	CA	California State University-Fullerton Foundation	Standard Grant	Susan Finger	07/31/2013	$48,040.00		jknott@fullerton.edu	1121 North State College Blvd.	Fullerton	CA	928313014	6572782106	EHR	7492, 1536	9178, SMET	$0.00	Geology (42)<br/><br/><br/>We are exploring the impact of using electronic student response systems to facilitate learning in large introductory geoscience courses across the country. Students are provided a personally registered remote control that is used to answer conceptual questions during the actual class. The questions are text-, diagram- or graph-based multiple choice questions that focus on one key concept. They are intended to reinforce material presented in class. They provide immediate feedback to students as class responses are collected in near-real time and displayed on a graph at the front of the classroom. Students and instructors analyze the graphs, discuss the results and use that information to guide subsequent activities. Small group discussion of class responses is the primary mode of instruction. We are analyzing over 9000 student responses to identify questions that can be used as reliable in-class assessments at other institutions. Teaching and learning aids are also being developed to help students identify ways to better prepare for class so that they are successful in and out of class. We are varying the types of questions, amounts of response data students see and questioning techniques to determine which combinations provide the richest learning experiences. Data are being collected in six different states at community colleges, four-year colleges and research universities. The intellectual merit of this proposal includes analyses of data regarding the utility of using electronic response system and questions across populations, disciplines and educational settings and identification of better ways to ensure a scientifically literate population of non-science majors. The broader impact of this proposal includes the thorough study and documentation of student response to these questions by gender and ethnicity. Such documentation is leading to recommendations for how faculty can employ such assessments in the most inclusive way possible.

One example is the conversion between text and speech using speech synthesis and speech recognition. However, such conversion is rare between other modalities. In particular, relatively little research has considered the transformation from general text to pictorial representations. This project will develop general-purpose Text-to- Picture synthesis algorithms that automatically generate pictures from natural language sentences so that the picture conveys the main meaning of the text. Unlike prior systems that require hand-crafted narrative descriptions of a scene, algorithms will generate static or animated pictures that represent important objects, spatial relations, and actions for general text. Key components include extracting important information from text, generating corresponding images for each piece of information, composing the images into a coherent picture, and evaluation. The proposed approach uses statistical machine learning and draws ideas from automatic machine translation, text summarization, text-to-speech synthesis, computer vision, and graphics. This research will produce computational methods as well as working systems.<br/><br/>Text-to-picture synthesis is likely to have a number of important broad impacts. First, it has the potential for improving literacy across a range of groups including children who need additional support in learning to read, and adults who are learning a second language. Second, it may be used as an assistive communication tool for people with disabilities such as dyslexia and brain damage, and as a universal language when communication is needed simultaneously to many people who speak different languages. Third, it can be a summarization tool for rapidly browsing long text documents. This research will foster collaboration between researchers in computer <br/>science and other disciplines, including psychology and education. <br/>Results of the project will be disseminated through technical publications, public web pages and software, seminars and talks, and classroom education.<br/><br/>URL: http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~jerryzhu/ttp/

This is a nonlinear Schroedinger equation which arises from geometrical considerations and also as a version of the Heisenberg model of ferro-magnetism. The fundamental question is, under what conditions on the data, is there global existence of the solutions and when is there blow-up of solutions. To study this, we shall investigate the dynamics of solutions with very rough initial data and will use fine tools from harmonic analysis and Riemannian geometry as well as partial differential equations methods. It is expected that the analysis will be more difficult than the Wave map equation which has been studied extensively recently. The Schroedinger map equation has a special nonlinear term; under this project various other non-generic nonlinearities will also be studied. <br/><br/>Since the primary problems to be studied in this project arise in well-known physical theories, the results obtained should have some impact for theories of electromagnetism and ferromagnetic materials. They may well prove to be prototypical problems for a number of other important equations that arise in geometry and physics and for which existence and blow-up results are yet to be obtained.

This research project will be the second phase of an ambitious international, multidisciplinary, collaborative program of paleoenvironmental research in southwestern Africa, including Namibia and parts of Botswana and South Africa. In the first phase of this program, the investigators made a number of significant discoveries. The second phase will continue the process of acquiring the paleovegetation and paleoclimatic data for southern Africa that is needed to improve current biome and general circulation model simulations so that they can better predict past and future conditions, including the possible impacts of continued global warming. The investigators have adopted a multi-proxy approach to paleoclimate research over a broad area in order to assess temporal variations in climate in a spatial context. The sites that they will examine will provide data for areas that today receive a significant proportion of their rain in winter (such as southwestern Namibia and northwestern South Africa), as well as areas that are dominated by summer rainfall brought from the Atlantic Ocean by Zaire air (largely northern Namibia and northern Botswana) or from the Indian Ocean (Botswana, most of northwestern South Africa, and eastern Namibia). The investigators' ultimate objective is to combine paleoenvironmental data from raised marine terrace and fluvial sediments, pan/lunette and relict linear dune systems, and data from spring mounds, hyrax middens, waterfall tufas, and cave speleothems to develop the most detailed and comprehensive late Pleistocene record of climate change for southwestern Africa, including a high-resolution record for the Holocene. They are particularly interested in determining conditions in southwestern Africa during major climatic events identified in the Northern Hemisphere and in ice and marine cores, including the Last Glacial Maximum, Younger Dryas, Holocene Optimum, Medieval Optimum, and Little Ice Age. AMS radiocarbon, ICPMS U-series, and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating will be used to develop chronologies for the various data sets.<br/><br/>This project is expected to make a number of significant research contributions. The investigators expect to show that the northern limit of the Namib Sand Sea was south of its present boundary, the Kuiseb River, during the late Pleistocene questioning the antiquity of the dunes if not the aridity. They will produce the most detailed record of Holocene climate changes for anywhere in Africa to assist those working with general circulation models. They will generate a long record (possibly to between 100,000 and 350,000 years before the present) that will enable comparison with ocean core, ice core, and solar variability data, thereby allowing more realistic explanations of past climate changes in southern Africa. The investigators will not focus on just one source of data that could provide misleading, incomplete, or ambiguous results but instead will bring together evidence of past increased activity in ancient fluvial, lake, and dune systems with higher-resolution data on climate change obtained from cave stalagmites. In the absence of ideal sediments for pollen studies in these semiarid and arid environments , they will obtain pollen from dated hyrax middens, thereby providing paleovegetation data for at least the last 50,000 years. Because the project is being undertaken by ten scientists from ten different institutions in Namibia, South Africa, Spain, and the U.S., it will foster international collaboration. Namibian and American students will be provided funding so that they can participate in the research program, and one post-doctoral researcher from Spain will also be involved. The results of our research will be made available through publication in international journals, as well as in South African, Namibian, and Botswana journals. This award is jointly funded by the NSF Office of International Science and Engineering.

It could similarly aid clinicians and healthcare professionals providing treatment. The success of these applications though will critically depend on the ease with which a robot can be commanded to perform common manipulation tasks within a home environment. Thus, the focus of the proposed research is to addresses this key challenge in two significant ways. First, by learning from teleoperated manipulation (i.e. teleoperative-based instruction), robots can acquire the ability to perform elements of common tasks with greater autonomy and reliability. Second, by automatically mapping new modalities (e.g. voice and gesture commands) to the robot's user interface, a wider variety of people will be able to use the robot more easily. The resulting multimodal interfaces may be especially important for people who have difficulty using a single modality, such as vision. These two fundamental research components underlie the basis of our approach to enable manipulation of everyday objects in an unstructured human environment.

These often conspicuous beetles, frequently used in environmental studies, are an important component of terrestrial ecosystems, but their current classification is outdated, hampering further exploration of this group. Incorporating morphological data, DNA, and fossils, this project will provide a genus-level revision of the tribe, its phylogenetic system, online identification keys, and species catalogs for all genera. Such tools will enable a much broader use of these invertebrates in biodiversity studies. All results will be disseminated by Internet-based publications.<br/><br/>Popular publications in broad outreach media generated by this project will increase public awareness of the role and abundance of rove beetles in nature. Planned workshops on the methods of study of Staphylinini applicable to an overall soil invertebrate fauna will be presented by the investigators during fieldwork in several countries, will contribute to the research infrastructure of those biodiversity hotspots. This project will enhance collaboration among the Field Museum, the University of Tennessee-Chattanooga, the University of Kansas, the Natural History Museum of Denmark, and several other institutions worldwide; and will provide unique learning opportunities for several undergraduate and high school students in the United States and other countries.

The languages with the most elaborated systems of clicks are currently endangered, so our chances of understanding the range of these sounds that human languages can accommodate are dwindling.  With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Amanda Miller (Cornell University) and Dr. Bonnie Sands (Northern Arizona University) will analyze the physical properties of these complex sounds. A newly-developed ultrasound imaging methodology will greatly enhance our knowledge of the movements of the tongue during these consonants. Current phonetic thinking, as seen in the International Phonetic Alphabet, encompasses five clicks (bilabial, dental, alveolar, palatal and lateral), but preliminary work has revealed that there are an additional three click types: retroflex, palatoalveolar lateral, and forward-released (or denti-alveolar) lateral.  A completely new class of sounds, linguopulmonic consonants, that seem to entail a phonological airstream contour, has also been tentatively identified. The researchers, with assistance from Laurentius Davids of the National Institute for Educational Development in Namibia and Dr. Kemmonye Monaka of the University of Botswana, will study the kinematics of unrecognized clicks and new types of consonants and compare them with the known click types so that the articulatory, acoustic and phonological properties of all clicks will be better understood. Research will focus on 5 click languages: Ekoka !Xung, Grootfontein !Xung, Ju|''hoansi, =/Hoan, and Mangetti Dune !Xung. <br/><br/>Marginal and complex sounds found in African languages must fit into universal models of human language, but they have often been neglected given that existing models have typically been built around European languages and a select range of others. The present research will also aid the development of orthographies for the languages under study. The project will result in an audio and video database of Khoesan language speech acoustics and production that will be transcribed, annotated, placed in a public archive and made available to interested researchers. This database will be a unique source of information on synchronic and diachronic phonological patterns involving clicks (particularly those patterns between vowels made towards the front of the mouth and clicks which involve retraction of the tongue). The description of the physical properties (phonetic) and mental representations (phonology) of unrecognized consonants resulting from this research will allow these rare consonants to shape universal linguistic theories beyond the life of the currently threatened languages.

Alan Deino and Paul Renne will embark on a three-year effort to upgrade the 40Ar/39Ar dating facilities at the Berkeley Geochronology Center in Berkeley, California, in order to attain the highest possible levels of precision, accuracy and throughput, and the broadest range of capability in determining the age of geological samples related to archaeometry. The 40Ar/39Ar dating method has the broadest temporal range of applicability in archeological and paleoanthropological contexts, and is well established as a highly accurate and precise dating tool that has contributed widely to the study of hominid and hominoid evolution. Though routine in some regards, evolving technology permits continued improvements in the method's capabilities, particularly in dating younger, smaller, or less potassic materials. Such improvements pay large scientific dividends by expanding the scope of problems that can be solved.<br/><br/>This grant will be vital both to maintaining routine availability of 40Ar/39Ar dating for the archeological and paleoanthropological communities, as well as to advance the capabilities of 40Ar/39Ar dating methods at BGC. It will help sustain routine access to high-quality 40Ar/39Ar data for archeological and paleoanthropological research worldwide and to continue refinement of 40Ar/39Ar methods to improve precision and accuracy, particularly at the younger end of applicability. Finally, this grant will provide the opportunity to replace or augment old equipment to maintain high levels of productivity and scientific excellence.<br/><br/>In order to address these goals over the next three years, the grant will be focused primarily in three areas: 1) Development of an ultra clean, high-throughput extraction system that will be a suitable match to a separately funded, new multi-collector noble-gas mass spectrometer; 2) Continued development of the computer control systems and data reduction techniques necessary to utilize the new multi-collector machine; and 3) Modifications to sample processing facilities to improve efficiency of sample preparation. A new generation extraction line characterized by rapid throughput will be essential to take full advantage of the highly accelerated speed of data collection anticipated with the new multi-collector mass spectrometer. Further development of in-house computer control systems is necessitated by the requirements of a new generation of multi-collector machines that is now breaking on the 40Ar/39Ar dating community. Improvements in sample preparation will enable the supply of high-quality samples to keep pace with the increased analytical throughput.

The primary goal of this project is to improve the academic outcomes for undergraduate students with learning and attention disabilities in gateway calculus and chemistry courses by implementing the use of an adapted peer led team learning (APLTL) program. This program includes a peer mentoring program to help students with course content to improve student understanding and knowledge of specific academic materials and to help students by employing strategies-based instruction to improve executive function skills, particularly in the areas of organization, problem solving, reading comprehension, flexible shifting of actions to meet task demands, and persistence towards a goal. This project builds on the successful work already conducted by the team, at Washington University's (WU) Center for Advanced Learning (CAL); with the cooperation of WU's academic departments the CAL's staff have already created academic bridge and peer led team learning programs for students without disabilities in STEM.<br/><br/>The team from WU, which is lead by a psychologist who is also a WU Assistant Vice Chancellor and the Director of the CAL, includes experts in post-secondary disability services, faculty and staff with expertise in college calculus and chemistry education, and an expert in post-secondary learning services for students with learning and attention disabilities. The proposal includes a quasi-experimental design to compare the calculus and chemistry performance of approximately 40 students with learning and attention disabilities who participate in the APLTL program, to the performance of a cohort of similar students enrolled in the same courses who do not participate in the program.<br/><br/>The project directly addresses the RDE-DEI track goals by enriching the academic experiences of students with learning and attention disabilities in post-secondary calculus and chemistry courses, and by demonstrating the effectiveness of a highly specialized mentoring program within a private undergraduate institution. There is a formative and summative project evaluation plan which is being conducted by a WU internal evaluator, Larry Handlin, who is the CAL's Assistant Director for Evaluation. There is also a dissemination plan which includes web-based materials for university faculty and staff to develop similar STEM APLTL programs at other campuses, publications in peer-reviewed professional journals, and presentations at the annual convention of the Association for Higher Education and Disability, the annual University of Connecticut's Post Secondary Training Institute, and the annual RDE PI meeting.

The primary goal of this project is to address the relatively poor math achievement of middle and high school students who are blind and who have the academic ability to participate in STEM fields. This goal is addressed through a series of experiments to study three (3) primary objectives: The investigation of math problem solving cognitive processes in blind students with a focus on characteristics of word problems associated with successful problem representation; the evaluation of the contribution of mathematics motivation to math learning in blind students with a focus on self-regulated behaviors such as help-seeking and persistence; and the adaptation of technology-based instruction to help improve math problem solving in blind students. This project builds on the prior success of the PI's current and previous work on the cognitive and motivational outcomes of tutoring technology for non-disabled students in mathematics that was funded by NSF (DRL-0411886) and the US Education Department's Institute of Educational Sciences (R305K050086).<br/><br/>This highly experienced team from the University of Southern California (USC), which is lead by an expert research psychologist, is conducting three (3) experiments with blind middle and high school students using quasi-experimental designs to compare the mathematics performance of the blind students to each other and to the mathematics performance of sighted students. The experiments involve 60 middle and high school students who are blind and recruited through an existing partnership with the Los Angeles Unified School District's (LAUSD) Program for Students with Visual Impairments. The data for the sighted students includes comparison data from 60 sighted peers as well as using an existing dataset with performance data from over 500 sighted student subjects. <br/><br/>The project primarily addresses one (1) of the FRI track goals: To investigate effective instructional methods and practices for people with disabilities in STEM. There is a formative and summative project evaluation plan being conducted by an experienced independent external evaluator, Valerie Shute, from Florida State University. Additional formative project input is provided by a team of expert advisors who are experienced in STEM education for blind students, spatial cognition and working memory, and the use of technologies for learning. There is also a dissemination plan which includes sharing information with the RDE community and publishing in peer-reviewed professional journals.

The proposed approach is based on modeling the structure of time-varying natural images, and developing model neural systems capable of efficiently representing this structure. This approach will shed light on the underlying neural mechanisms involved in visual perception and will apply these mechanisms to practical problems in image analysis and computer vision.<br/><br/>The models that are to be developed will allow the invariant structure in images (form, shape) to be described independently of its variations (position, size, rotation). The models are composed of multiple layers that capture progressively more complex forms of <br/>scene structure in addition to modeling their transformations. <br/>Mathematically, these multi-layer models have a bilinear form in which the variables representing shape and form interact multiplicatively with the variables representing position, size or other variations. The parameters of the model are learned from the statistics of time-varying natural images using the principles of sparse and efficient coding.<br/><br/>The early measurements and models of natural image structure have had a profound impact on a wide variety of disciplines including visual neuroscience (e.g. predictions of receptive field properties of retinal ganglion cells and cortical simple cells in visual cortex) and image processing (e.g. wavelets, multi-scale representations, image denoising). The approach outlined in this proposal extends this interdisciplinary work by learning higher-order scene structure <br/>from sequences of time-varying natural images. Given the <br/>evolutionary pressures on the visual cortex to process time-varying images efficiently, it is plausible that the computations performed by the cortex can be understood in part from the constraints imposed by efficient processing. Modeling the higher order structure will also advance the development of practical image processing algorithms by finding good representations for image-processing tasks such as video search and indexing. Completion of the specific goals described in this proposal will provide (1) mathematical models that can help elucidate the underlying neural mechanisms involved in visual perception and (2) new generative models of time-varying images that better describe their structure.<br/><br/>The explosion of digital images and video has created a national priority of providing better tools for tasks such as object recognition and search, navigation, surveillance, and image analysis. The models developed as part of this proposal are broadly applicable to these tasks. Results from this research program will be integrated into a new neural computation course at UC Berkeley, presented at national multi-disciplinary conferences, and published in a timely manner in leading peer-reviewed journals. Participation in proposed research is available to both graduate and undergraduate levels, and the PI will advise Ph.D. students in both neuroscience and engineering as part of this project.<br/><br/>URL: http://redwood.berkeley.edu/wiki/NSF_Funded_Research

Actions by the variables become commuting homeomorphisms, and corresponding dynamical invariants (e.g., numbers of periodic points, topological entropy, etc.) provide new topologicial invariants.<br/>The focus will be on Mahler measure, surface dynamics and twisted homology. The project will strengthen newly emerging connections between knot theory, dynamical systems and number theory.<br/><br/><br/>Although knots and links arise in a host of scientific phenomena such as DNA, solar flares and fluid flows, their mathematical study is fairly new. Fueled by ideas from many areas of mathematics, progress in knot theory has exploded during the past two decades, and the subject now attracts wide interest from physicists, biologists and engineers as well as mathematicians. This project will continue the investigators' program of applying ideas from another mathematical field, dynamical systems, in order to gain a new perspective. <br/>Computer methods will be used to develop hypotheses. The PIs will also write a monograph, the first survey of this interdisciplinary study, designed for graduate students and researchers.

For instance, the vast majority of current Internet usage is data retrieval and service access, whereas the architecture was designed around host-to-host applications such as telnet and ftp. Moreover, the original Internet was a purely transparent carrier of packets, but now the various network stakeholders use middleboxes to improve security and accelerate applications. To adapt to these changes, this project will design, develop and deploy a design called the Data- Oriented Network Architecture (DONA). DONA replaces DNS names with flat, self-certifying names, and replaces DNS name resolution with a name-based anycast primitive that lives above the IP layer. <br/><br/>Broader Impact: DONA improves data retrieval and service access by providing stronger and more architecturally coherent support for name persistence, content availability, and data authentication. It can also be extended to provide support for caching and RSS-like updates.

Anti-virus and anti-spyware programs, personal firewalls,<br/>intrusion-detection tools, Java's stack inspection, and even mechanisms that trap operatingsystem<br/>exceptions in order to show a ?blue screen of death? can all be thought of as run-time<br/>monitors. Although they differ greatly in their complexity and scope of policies that they can<br/>enforce, these mechanisms all observe the behavior of a running system and detect and react<br/>to potentially dangerous events. Despite the pervasiveness and real-world importance of runtime<br/>monitors, their use has far outpaced theoretical work that makes it possible to rigorously<br/>reason about monitors and the policies that they enforce, particularly in distributed settings.<br/>This project develops models, tools, and mechanisms for reasoning about and implementing<br/>distributed, concurrently executing run-time monitors. The research adopts a holistic,<br/>four-prong approach that spans the breadth of the space between theoretical models and<br/>practical systems for enforcing run-time policies. Specifically, this project (1) creates a<br/>framework for reasoning about enforcement that permits the possibilities of concurrent, distributed<br/>computations; (2) develops a type-safe policy-specification language that ensures<br/>that specified policies compile into well-behaved monitoring mechanisms; (3) designs trustworthy<br/>algorithms for automatically translating a desired overall policy into node-specific<br/>policies that can be distributed and enforced throughout a network; and (4) designs, implements,<br/>and tests a prototype system for specifying and enforcing run-time policies with<br/>support for concurrently executing computations. Taken together, these research tasks enable<br/>formal modeling and automatic enforcement of run-time security policies in concurrent<br/>and distributed settings.

This instrument will detect photons with one order of magnitude more efficiency than the existing, semi-conductor based photon detector at the NSCL. This increased sensitivity translates into increased scientific reach and opens the possibility of a new class of spectroscopy experiments at the forefront of nuclear science.<br/>The study of rare isotopes is of key interest to nuclear science, as theories developed for stable atomic nuclei have been shown to lose their predictive power for very neutron-rich and very neutron-deficient atomic nuclei (rare isotopes). The Coupled Cyclotron Facility at the NSCL is a national user facility that has been built to produce some of the most intense beams of very neutron-deficient and very neutron-rich atomic nuclei worldwide. About half of all experiments at the NSCL require photon detection to precisely identify the final state of the atomic nucleus after a reaction or decay. The proposed instrument will enable nuclear structure and nuclear astrophysics studies of the most exotic isotopes that are made at the NSCL. Experimental data on these most exotic isotopes are particularly important since they provide the largest constraints on theoretical predictions and can check or invalidate the theoretical extrapolations from stable atomic nuclei. An<br/>increase in detection efficiency of one order of magnitude will make key experiments possible.

Students are provided a personally registered remote control that is used to answer conceptual questions during the actual class. The questions are text-, diagram- or graph-based multiple choice questions that focus on one key concept. They are intended to reinforce material presented in class. They provide immediate feedback to students as class responses are collected in near-real time and displayed on a graph at the front of the classroom. Students and instructors analyze the graphs, discuss the results and use that information to guide subsequent activities. Small group discussion of class responses is the primary mode of instruction. We are analyzing over 9000 student responses to identify questions that can be used as reliable in-class assessments at other institutions. Teaching and learning aids are also being developed to help students identify ways to better prepare for class so that they are successful in and out of class. We are varying the types of questions, amounts of response data students see and questioning techniques to determine which combinations provide the richest learning experiences. Data are being collected in six different states at community colleges, four-year colleges and research universities. The intellectual merit of this proposal includes analyses of data regarding the utility of using electronic response system and questions across populations, disciplines and educational settings and identification of better ways to ensure a scientifically literate population of non-science majors. The broader impact of this proposal includes the thorough study and documentation of student response to these questions by gender and ethnicity. Such documentation is leading to recommendations for how faculty can employ such assessments in the most inclusive way possible.

In the process it will develop novel computational techniques for analyzing large-scale networks, which will have applicability across a wide variety of domains. <br/><br/>The most important and complex decisions made by governments and organizations occur in group contexts. A central challenge, spurred by new developments in information technologies (IT), is that the nature of groups and how they operate has changed radically. Today, many groups ? in social, political, and economic contexts - are ad hoc, agile, transient entities that emerge from a larger primordial network of relationships. For a short time, these groups accomplish a variety of tasks, and then they dissolve, only to be reconstituted later with a different configuration. While there is growing awareness of the socio-economic consequences of these groups, our understanding of how they form and their impact on effectiveness is severely limited. <br/><br/>This project will address this limitation by developing a theoretical framework that reflects the contemporary conceptualizations of groups. It proposes a network approach to modeling the eco-system of overlapping and constantly changing groups that constitute the fabric of contemporary society. It recognizes that empirically testing such a model poses formidable data collection challenges. However, a unique resource available to the research team is access to all behavioral traces (server logs) from one of the world''s largest Massively Multiplayer Online (MMO) games, EverQuest 2, which is particularly well-suited to theorize and empirically model the dynamics of group behavior. MMOs comprise tens of thousands of players who are at any one point in time coalescing in thousands of groups to accomplish quests and raids that involve a variety of activities similar to tasks we undertake in real life ? finding information or materials, making, selling or buying products and services. <br/><br/>Beyond the data collection challenge, the scale of the proposed research enterprise also poses significant computational challenges in uncovering and analyzing the complexities that govern the dynamics of group behavior in these virtual worlds. Using advanced computing applications and technologies, this project seeks to capture, infer, and model the networks that explain how groups emerge and how they function. Specifically, the researchers will use temporally evolving graphs to model such networks, and develop scalable algorithms to compute metrics of group behavior on them. Tying these complex and shifting individual and networked behaviors to traditional forms of analyses represents a novel interdisciplinary challenge in both scope and complexity. <br/><br/>The project will expand our knowledge of how groups form and operate in larger ecosystems of groups, individuals, and organizations. The analysis of logs generated from Virtual Worlds poses novel challenges from a computational perspective. This interdisciplinary investigation will result in new (1) information models for modeling the Virtual World, (2) data structuring and algorithmic techniques for data access and analysis, and (3) techniques for computational efficiency. <br/><br/>The knowledge and tools developed in this research will allow researchers to understand more fully, and practitioners to cultivate more effectively, the emergence and performance of ad hoc groups in contemporary society. It will also provide other disciplines with new computational and statistical modeling methodologies and tools, which should have considerable positive implications for future research in other disciplinary areas. The findings and deliverables of the proposed research will be immediately generalizable to training and education related to groups (beyond just MMOs or Virtual Worlds), social networks, and online games.

The overall goal of this interdisciplinary research project is to couple human behavior with flows of macroelements (C, N, and P) through households. The investigators will quantify total fluxes of C, N, and P through households in the Twin Cities of Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota, and they will look to expand basic understanding of the factors that influence household choices regarding consumption and macroelement fluxes through households. The investigators hypothesize that element fluxes are highly variable and skewed, with relatively few households contributing disproportionately to overall fluxes. Another hypothesis to be tested posits that the magnitude of elemental fluxes through households can be predicted from knowledge of daily consumption choices along with long-term choices regarding household infrastructure, such as house size and lawn area. To test these hypotheses, 400 owner-occupied, single unit households in Ramsey County will be randomly selected to cover a range of household characteristics. These households will be studied using an intensive mail survey, a landscape inventory, and homeowner energy bills. Data will be entered into a previously developed Household Flux Calculator (HFC) model to generate fluxes of C, N, and P. Survey data will additionally be used to link element fluxes with factors related to human choices like attitudes, norms, perceived control, and demographic factors.<br/><br/>This project is expected to integrate human choice and biophysical characteristics into a model of household biogeochemistry using a transdisciplinary approach that integrates biophysical and social research approaches. The project will provide research opportunities for post-docs, graduate students, and undergraduate students. By incorporating the HFC directly into classroom education, it will allow students to explore hypotheses regarding impacts of consumption. In addition, project outcomes will be used to help develop a new paradigm for pollution control, one based on source reduction and information feedback loops to guide adaptive management. This project is supported by an award resulting from the NSF competition focusing on the Dynamics of Coupled Natural and Human Systems.

For at least the past few million years a convincing case can be made that the cycles are often controlled by the periodic variations in Earth's orbit and rotation as well as interactions with nearby planets that produce climate variations every 20, 40, 100, and 400 ky. However in more ancient rocks the problem is much more difficult because of a lack of independent age control which leads to a-priori corrections for apparent changes in sediment accumulation rates prior to testing the orbital forcing hypothesis. Recurrent evidence for incompleteness of cyclical records exacerbates the problem, because any strata missing within orbital timescales cannot be detected by existing pre-Neogene chronologies. If one could document that these cycles occur in rocks that are 50 million years old, for example, it would allow geoscientists to tell time in rocks for the past 50 million years at unprecedented levels of precision by matching models for Solar System dynamics with cycles in rocks. <br/><br/>We propose a program, of high-resolution U-Pb zircon geochronology to resolve the orbital forcing debate for one of the classic examples of cyclic sediments, the Early Eocene Green River Formation. These spectacularly preserved rocks were deposited in a large lake ca. 50 million years ago. The goal of the proposed work is to quantitatively test, at high precision, the hypothesis that the cyclicity in the Green River Fm. is orbitally forced, where the forcing is achieved through changes in Earth's climate that are paced by the periodic changes in the Earth's orbit. We propose to use U-Pb zircon geochronology from abundant interlayered ash beds to provide at least one age per ~100 ky interval with expected precision of less than plus or minus 50 ky. <br/><br/>In addition and partially related to the debate about the origin of sediment cyclicity, this research will also test climate's role in the stratigraphic architecture of lacustrine strata. The Early Eocene Climate Optimum is the warmest interval preceding the prolonged cooling that culminated in the current glaciated climate, and thus finding reliable, highly resolved climate records is especially relevant in view of future warmer conditions predicted with anthropogenic increases in pCO2. A highly resolved Early Eocene climate history will have far reaching implications for understanding the effect of climate on mammalian evolution and allow detailed evaluation of the robustness of dynamical models for the Solar System to ca. 50 Ma. <br/><br/>The proposed research is an outcome of EARTHTIME (www.earth-time.org), an initiative to bring together a broad cross-section of geochronologists, paleontologists, and stratigraphers with the goal of sequencing Earth history at a much-improved level of resolution. The proposed research will provide a new approach to calibrating the Early Eocene part of the time-scale and will allow for detailed cross-calibration between 40Ar/39Ar and U-Pb chronometers.

Electron cryo-microscopy (cryoEM) is the most appropriate structural tool to determine molecular structures of biological nanomachines that generally consist of multiple protein subunits and/or nucleic acids with a total mass greater than 0.5 million Daltons. The goal is to develop information discovery and integration methodologies for deriving atomic models of nanomachines. Such models will be derived from 3-dimensional (3-D) cryoEM mass density function (i.e. a volumetric density map) in conjunction with physics of protein folding and informatics data. This project is made possible by an integration of the expertise of five investigators in computer graphics, computational biophysics, structural informatics and cryoEM. The intellectual merit of this research is highlighted by the computational approaches of extracting structural information from low-resolution, complex cryoEM volume densities and integrating this information into classical protein structure modeling paradigms, such as comparative modeling and ab initio modeling, for understanding biological nanomachines. The three research goals involve information discovery, information integration and validation of the proposed algorithms. The proposed research will have significant impacts in three disparate disciplines: computer science, molecular modeling, and cryoEM. Furthermore, the team will disseminate their resulting tools freely to the academic community and will host a workshop towards the end of the project. To enhance the impact of their research, the investigators will integrate research with education at each member institution with an eye towards diversity. In particular, these investigators will develop a virtual didactic course in modeling of biological nanomachines for graduate and senior undergraduate students at the five participating institutions.

One aspect that has until recently been a puzzle, is --why with the low vent fluid pH had no acidophiles been isolated from these ecosystems? Given the recent discovery that the first cultured member of the deep-sea endemic archeael lineage, DHVE2, is a thermoacidophile, growing best at pH 4.5 and unable to grow above pH 6, the investigators in this project are poised to use this organism as a model organism to explore the ecology of thermoacidophiles at deep-sea vents. Furthermore, this is the most abundant archaeal lineage detected in many molecular taxonomy studies, representing up to 15% of the archaeal community, and its genome is currently being sequenced by the Venter Institute. Therefore, the proposed study will further our understanding of the molecular physiological ecology and biogeography of this important archaeal lineage at hydrothermal vents. The long-term objective of this project is to provide insights into the role that thermoacidophiles play in deep-sea hydrothermal vent ecosystems. Specific objectives include understanding the spatial distribution, relative abundance and co-occurrence patterns of thermoacidophilic archaea in chimneys from the Eastern Lau Spreading Center, Guaymas Basin and Mid-Atlanic Ridge vent sites, and to examine the vent chemistries at these sites as they could have dramatic effects on the occurrence of thermoacidophiles and affect the competition for overlapping niches with other vent microbes. The investigators in this project are predicting that thermoacidophiles will be more abundant at deep-sea vent sites of intermediate pH (pH 3-5), whereas they will be less abundant in sites with extreme vent fluid pH (pH <3, >5). To accomplish this work the investigators will collect chimney samples from the three contrasting deep-sea hydrothermal vent systems named above. A variety of cultivation and molecular techniques will be conducted on samples collected at these locations to look at the diversity of thermoacidophiles between vent sites, their ability to compete with other vent bacteria, and their metabolic activity. Additionally, new thermoacidophiles from deep-sea vents will be isolated and characterized. The unique biology of thermoacidophiles is being used in bioleaching/biomining applications and the discovery of new thermoacidophiles from deep-sea vents has the potential to provide tools for bioremediation and biotechnological applications by these organisms. The investigators are also involved in the training of minority graduate students and high school science teachers.

Because of the vast diversity in paternal responses across mammalian species, paternal responsiveness will be the focus of this project which will determine the underlying brain and hormonal mechanisms of parental nurturing responses. Specifically, Peromysus californicus, a monogamous, bi-parental species that exhibits full paternal care toward their offspring will be compared to Peromyscus maniculatus, a species that typically does not exhibit paternal care. These studies will compare the neuronal activation of brain circuits following pup-exposure and will examine the number of newly proliferated cells in the brain. Since vasopressin and oxytocin are neuropeptides known to be involved in affiliation processes, vasopressin and oxytocin distributions in the brain will be measured and the levels of these neuropeptides in circulation will be assessed to determine the plasticity of the nurturing response, even in mammals that are not predisposed toward paternal affiliative responses. Information related specifically to the characterization of the paternal response or, more generally, to enhanced social motivation will have implications for understanding complex social responses (e.g., nurturing and affiliative responses) in various species. During the course of these studies, a high priority will be placed on the recruitment and training of undergraduate students in all phases of the project. Further, the PI will serve as a mentor for a post-doctoral assistant interested in a subsequent career establishing an engaging undergraduate neuroscience research program.

William Poirier of Texas Tech University is supported by a Small Grant for Exploratory Research from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program to develop a new approach for dynamics simulations that uses classical-like trajectories, but yields accurate quantum results. In particular, the PI is implementing a new, bipolar quantum trajectory method (QTM) that avoids the problem of erratic trajectory behavior in the presence of interference. In addition, the quantum trajectories in this method approach their classical counterparts in the limit of large molecular masses. Two avenues are under development to apply bipolar QTM ideas to quantum simulations. One resembles the trajectory surface hopping method, and the other is based on wave packet dynamics. This work is having a broader impact by addressing a key problem in computational chemistry. The PI's methods will allow studies of larger and more diverse systems than are currently amenable to quantum simulations. A web-based quantum dynamics tutorial is under development to familiarize students and researchers with QTM ideas and to run simple QTM calculations.

The primary goal of this experiment is to make long-term observations of detailed evolutions of internal waves, instabilities, and mixing at time scales from 1-min to months and at vertical scales from 0.5 m to O(100) m below the equatorial cold tongue. The tongue of cold water straddling the equator in the eastern Pacific is one of the major sea surface temperature (SST) features influencing tropical air-sea interactions. Vertical turbulent fluxes through the base of the surface mixed layer are major factors in the heat budget that determines SST. Strong turbulence during La Nina cools the mixed layer, strengthening the cold tongue. Weak turbulence during El Nino allows the mixed layer to warm, weakening or erasing the cold tongue. Several periods of intensive microstructure profiling discovered the role of small-scale mixing in modulating the cold tongue, but attempts to parameterize the turbulent fluxes failed because the physics leading to instabilities and turbulence has not been captured by these measurements. Previous observations indicate that internal waves play the key role by providing the finescale shear that trigger instabilities. High spatial and temporal resolutions of measurements, sufficiently capturing instabilities below the cold tongue, are needed, but have not been made.<br/><br/>In the present experiment, shear and strain will be measured at 1-minute intervals over vertical scales of O (1-100) m and turbulent scalar diffusion rates immediately beneath the surface mixed layer in the cold tongue. Co-investigators Moum and Nash at OSU have recently developed a moored microstructure package that can reliably measure turbulent scalar diffusion rates in the equatorial undercurrent. Closely vertically spaced instruments measuring velocity, temperature, salinity and mixing rates will be mounted on a surface mooring. The mooring will be 5 miles from the long-term TAO mooring at 0 140 W. The experiment will be coordinated with another funded observational program. In spring 2008, 10 pods, evenly spaced between 30 and 90-m depth, will be deployed on the long-term TAO mooring at 0 140 W. The deployment will be Immediately with18 days of shipboard microstructure profiler measurements.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit.<br/>Internal waves produce much of the diapycnal mixing in the ocean and must be understood and quantified before accurate mixing parameterizations can be developed. In the eastern equatorial Pacific, the stratified high-shear zone between the undercurrent core and the base of the mixed layer provides a unique environment for internal waves. Understanding it well enough to accurately parameterize the diapycnal mixing is a major intellectual challenge whose solution will advance the general understanding of internal waves, instabilities, and turbulence, as well as provide necessary support for climate studies.<br/><br/>Broader Impact<br/>This work is expected to lead to more accurate parameterizations of equatorial mixing in general circulation models (GCM) and thus to more realistic climate models. SST, air-sea interaction, and ENSO in the cold tongue are strongly controlled by the turbulence entrainment flux. To improve the large-scale model prediction of ENSO, we need to understand the physics of instabilities and turbulence and improve the turbulence parameterization in GCMs. The proposed project will provide support for the education of a graduate student. The observations and analysis results will be published on a publicly accessible website.

If we are to meet the demand for personalized one-on-one care for the growing populations of elderly individuals and those with special cognitive and social needs throughout life, great strides must be made in human-robot interaction (HRI) in order to bring robotics into everyday application domains. This interdisciplinary project identifies a specific set of HRI research questions in socially assistive robotics, the study of robotic systems capable of providing help through social rather than physical interaction. The research foci of the study are: embodiment, personality, empathy, and adaptivity toward the development of an assistive HRI model for customized time-extended assistive interaction. The research will be grounded in the stroke rehabilitation domain, where personalized and dedicated care is needed to provide supervision, motivation, and training during the critical post-stroke period and beyond, and where assistive HRI can play a key role. Specifically, a novel assistive HRI model will be developed based on personality matching between the user and the robot, in order to optimize the user's task performance on rehabilitation exercises. The model will be evaluated on multiple testbeds with a large pool of human subjects from the stroke patient population. An online learning algorithm will enable the robot to adapt to the user both over the course of short-term interactions during a single therapy sessions (e.g., in response to mood and fatigue), and time-extended interactions over multiple therapy sessions (e.g., in response to the evolving recovery process over months of rehabilitation). The work is the first to study the role of personality and empathy in assistive HRI with human subjects, as well as to engage in longitudinal assistive HRI research to assess time-extended human-machine interaction in the assistive context. An important contribution of the research is the unified and tightly integrated end-to-end approach, which combines key HRI issues of embodiment, personality, empathy and adaptivity in hypothesis-testing experiments. Project outcomes will also include a large and unique corpus of multi-modal data, which will be collected and analyzed, and made available to researchers across the relevant disciplines. The scientific impact will go well beyond novel insights toward a better understanding of the fundamentals of assistive HRI, and the role and potential for assistive human-machine interaction for stroke patient populations and rehabilitation in general.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: Currently there are about 750,000 new strokes per year in the United States, and some expect the number to double in the next twenty years with the growing elderly population. Project outcomes will provide pilot data necessary for translating the methodologies developed toward clinical applications.

In turn, this could provide an unprecedented opportunity for predicting and preventing future ecological problems by managing the ecology and health of our planet. Data mining and knowledge discovery techniques can aid this effort by discovering patterns that capture complex interactions among ocean temperature, air pressure, surface meteorology, and terrestrial carbon flux. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit<br/>The goals of this work are twofold: 1) to better understand global scale patterns in biosphere processes, particularly patterns in the global carbon cycle and climate system. More specifically, the proposed data mining research is driven by the need to address the following two challenges: (i) understanding how ocean, atmosphere and land processes are coupled and (ii) detecting and predicting ecosystem disturbances such as fires, floods, and hurricanes. 2) to support innovative Computer Science (CS) research in data mining. In particular, the spatio-temporal nature of Earth Science data means that standard CS data mining techniques often cannot be directly applied. As an example, in Earth Science research, a key step is the selection of the locations and time periods that are to be used to investigate possible relationships between two Earth Science phenomena, e.g., El Nino and milder winters in the Midwestern United States. Currently, this selection is based on domain knowledge, but automating this process would be very beneficial. The proposed work will develop new data mining techniques that address the high dimensionality, large size, and spatio-temporal nature of the data. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: New algorithms and techniques for the analysis of large spatio-temporal data sets developed in this project will be made available to other researchers within the Earth Science community. To a large extent, this project will encapsulate these algorithms within easy to use visual tools so that users will be able to more easily extract useful knowledge from Earth Science data sets. Although the focus will be on Earth Science data, the data mining techniques that are developed will be applicable to a wide variety of other fields that have data collected over time on a spatial grid. To give a specific example, spatio-temporal clustering has been used to track cyclones and animal migrations, and to model mobile phone users and neuronal activities in the brain, and the new spatio-temporal clustering techniques could also prove useful for these applications.

Animals differ widely in the means they use to convey information, and communicate. Understanding the causes and consequences of these differences can lead to fundamental insights into the nature of communication. Birds and humans both rely on visual communication, but birds can see many more colors, including ultraviolet (UV) colors invisible to humans, and in some cases, most of bird coloration is in the UV. To date, the study of the frequency and distribution of pure UV among birds has been hampered by both technical challenges (time-consuming nature of reflectance measurements) and by a focus on within species variation related to sexual dimorphism and sexual selection, rather than potential differences among species. This project will use the PI''''s recent discovery of a subtle, noncolored, but human-visible, marker associated with, and likely producing, pure UV coloration. This project is risky because at present we do not know how wide spread this marker is, if it always generates pure UV color, or if there are other, yet undiscovered properties of feathers that generate similar pure UV. This mechanism may be restricted to the birds the PI has already examined, or could be wide spread, and if so, would dramatically change our perspective on the importance of pure UV coloration for communication in birds. The PI proposes to examine specimens in major museum collections for this marker, test whether this marker does in fact confer pure UV reflectance in all species where it is found, and then use the large collections in American museums to look at the frequency and distribution of pure UV coloration in all of the birds of the world. Once this survey is completed, the resulting information could transform our understanding of several basic biological processes, including how organisms use structure to generate color, and the importance of enhanced color vision (sensitivity to pure UV) for the evolution of biodiversity and within versus between species communication. <br/><br/>This work has many broader impacts. This work is ideal for introducing young scientists to the fields of functional morphology, biophysics, systematics, and biodiversity. One graduate and one undergraduate student will participate in the project. The development of an inexpensive and low-teach biomarker method for evaluating the hidden colors of birds could open up this otherwise technical area of inquiry to developing science programs both domestically and abroad.

The research will concentrate on computer calculations of generation thrust on debris in space by ultra-short and very high intensity laser pulses and long pulses of powerful fiber laser.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/><br/>In 1997 the Project ORION was established by Air Force to assess the possibility of eliminating small size debris (< 10 cm) from space, by shooting a laser beam from the ground at individual debris. Such debris, being invisible for navigation devices, may be catastrophic for space vehicles during collision with them. The required laser beam energy was estimated to be in the range of 20 kJ per pulse with extremely low beam divergence (~ 1urad) in order for laser beam to provide adequate intensity on debris at distance ~ 1000 km from the Earth. This project will investigate the use of lasers orbiting in space to eliminate small debris by kicking them off of their orbits into lower orbits for the debris to burn up in the atmosphere. It will include research on comparing the efficiency of low energy ultrashort pulse laser and recently developed high power fiber laser for debris elimination. The PI will also investigate the advantages of using lasers located in space in comparison with ground base lasers.

These hypotheses challenge the secularization hypothesis assumptions that shaped modern development theory for the last half century. Assessing the hypotheses proposed here entails two phases of research. The first phase involves interviews with representatives of a range of development organizations across Latin America, Africa, and Asia, and content analysis of written material from those organizations. The second phase involves more focused examination of a few particular development organizations and their projects. <br/><br/>This research is particularly relevant to policy debates currently occurring in the United States about faith-based social service initiatives. Moreover, given the current crises facing humanity in terms of extreme global poverty, environmental degradation, and rising inequality, this research might help to identify, theorize, and publicize diverse approaches of development that may suggest compelling ways of resolving these crises. Finally, this research may also help in understanding some of the dimensions and causes of global conflicts that pivot around conflicting visions of social development.

Unfortunately, many research studies have also shown that biodiesel results in an increase in NOx emissions. The perceived NOx penalty associated with biodiesel threatens to limit its widespread acceptance since engine manufacturers and regulatory agencies continue to struggle with NOx emissions from mobile diesel sources. The vast majority of the literature has focused on differences in physical properties (bulk modulus, boiling point, viscosity, etc.) between biodiesel and petroleum diesel as the mechanism for increased biodiesel NOx. However, there is increasing evidence that biodiesel NOx increases are related to fundamental<br/>differences in the chemical oxidation mechanism of biodiesel (i.e. methyl esters) in comparison to petroleum diesel. Unfortunately, very little work has been done to develop detailed chemical kinetic mechanisms for long chain methyl esters and to evaluate why these molecules result in increased NOx<br/>and decreased PM. A better understanding of biodiesel NOx and soot processes, will lead to the development of even cleaner burning renewable fuels.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit<br/>This Major Research Instrumentation Grant is for the purchase of a rapid compression machine (RCM) that will be used for fundamental chemical kinetic studies on biofuels. An RCM is an instrument designed to simulate the compression stroke of a single engine cycle allowing auto-ignition phenomena to be studied in a much more controllable environment than that which is possible in an actual engine. The RCM will be integrated with a novel fast response NO/NO2 analyzer that will allow time-resolved NOx measurements and a rapid quenching system that will enable sophisticated gas analysis of combustion products and intermediates. By performing<br/>experiments on biofuels (and surrogate fuels) in an RCM it will be possible to <br/>isolate the chemical kinetic effects on NOx and soot production from the variety of other processes that are present in an actual diesel engine. Moreover, data acquired using this system will be integral to developing a data base necessary for adopting a universally accepted reference fuel for biodiesel, such as methyl oleate. Development of an RCM capability dedicated to alternative fuels research will effectively bridge the gap between the handful of fundamental combustion studies on smaller biodiesel surrogates and the multitude of engine studies in which the underlying mechanisms responsible for pollutant emissions are difficult to isolate.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/>Environmental essayist Bill McKibben rightfully suggests that global warming is the first civilization-scale challenge ever faced by the human race. While there is no single technological panacea for this omnipresent challenge, renewable fuels such as biodiesel have the potential to play a significant role in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions since they are nearly CO2 neutral. A solution to the perceived biodiesel NOx problem will result in further widespread acceptance of biodiesel by engine manufacturers and government agencies, thereby resulting in decreased greenhouse gas emissions. Decreasing PM emissions from diesel engines is an equally important issue that can be addressed through the use of biodiesel. Diesel PM has been classified as a probable human carcinogen by the World Health Organization and the USEPA, and recent studies have linked diesel PM to heart disease.

A superfluid will flow with no friction. In that way it is similar to a superconductor, which carried an electric current with no resistance. Therefore understanding superfluid helium can provide insight into superconductors. This research project will study how impurities modify the class of ordered states that include the high temperature superconductors, using superfluid 3He (one type of helium) as a model system. Prior studies of superfluidity in liquid 3He contained within very low density silica aerogels (a very low density, highly porous material), which act as the impurities, found that the ordered state of the superfluid near its transition temperature was changed by the impurities, in a manner that was independent of the density of the impurities. The present research project will extend the range of density of the aerogel (impurities) to see how low the density can be and still modify the 3He ordered state; and to see if other ordered states can be stabilized over different ranges of impurity densities. Longitudinal magnetic resonance studies of the ordered state will be carried out to identify the microscopic nature of the state stabilized by the aerogel. The studies will also be carried out with different degrees of strain applied to the aerogel, to see how the affect of the aerogel 'impurities' depends upon anisotropy. This project will involve the training of undergraduate and graduate students, and the PI gives numerous technical and public lectures as a Nobel Laureate.<br/><br/>*****TECHNICAL ABSTRACT*****:<br/>This award supports a study of how impurity scattering in unconventional BCS states can affect the identity of the ordered state, using superfluidity in 3He as a model system, and low density silica aerogels as model impurities. Prior work has shown that aerogels with densities (fractional volume occupied by the aerogel) as low as 0.5% can stabilize a state near Tc that is not stable in the bulk, and that this new state is unchanged over a factor of two in variation in the aerogel density. The present research will extend the range of aerogel densities to 0.2%, and will include longitudinal resonance studies in the new state to help determine its microscopic identity. The application of variable longitudinal strain will help determine if the affects of the aerogel depend upon its anisotropy. Separately, the 3He A to B transition is a valuable model for studies of first order phase nucleation. A study of the A to B transition will be carried out to better understand the role of surface roughness in nucleation and to differentiate between the two proposed nucleation mechanisms involving nucleation by ionizing radiation. This work will involve the training of both undergraduate and graduate research students.

Squire for the acquisition of a high resolution microcomputed tomography instrument that will be used in research on mineralized biological samples. The micro-CT device allows nondestructive imaging of samples such as mineralized bone, teeth, and mollusk shells. This will allow researchers to study mechanical structure of bones in birds, bats, and mice, and the structure of snail shells. The researchers have active programs for undergraduate research during the academic year and summer. Half of the Biology majors are female, and female graduate students make up approximately 50% of the Masters Degree students. A college program called University of Success recruits economically disadvantaged, minority students, and fist generation college students, and this program will offer training programs using the new instrumentation.

Unlike the Internet where heterogeneity is normally addressed for the sake of functional interoperability, CPS systems are normally regarded as special-purpose systems of systems, designed mostly for critical infrastructures that require global regulation and performance assurance. Therefore, heterogeneity must be addressed not only for the sake of functional interoperability, but also for policy regulation and performance assurance.<br/>To address functional interoperability, a distributed framework, called the CPS-Bus, is proposed to flexibly interconnect different CPS subsystems. To support policy regulation, a policy specification language is developed to regulate the relationship between context, operation and rules. To achieve performance assurance over heterogeneous subsystems, a novel run-time combination of reflective interfaces and a distributed control framework is invented to address evolving performance dynamics and required on-demand functional (compositional) changes. This work will allow the effective interconnection of computation and physical processes to reveal the useful correlations among different phenomena and to conduct effective control across the boundary of CPS subsystems. For developers, this work will significantly reduce the design and development costs for building CPS systems. For end users, the resultant CPS systems will lead to exciting applications such as assisted living that will fundamentally improve the quality of every-day life.

Specifically, this project will (1) establish the optimal reaction conditions and the scope of these unique reactions, (2) determine the mechanistic details of these processes, and (3) examine applications in complex organic synthesis. The ultimate goal is to be able to predict when, where, and under what reaction conditions these Pd migrations are likely to take place and what reactions can be employed to effectively trap the resulting intermediates. <br/><br/>With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Professor Richard C. Larock, of the Department of Chemistry at Iowa State University. Professor Richard C. Larock's research efforts revolve around the discovery, development, and exploitation of novel reactions effected by palladium compounds. Such palladium compounds offer promise for efficient approaches for the synthesis of complex organic molecules as well as the preparation of molecules that are virtually inaccessible in the absence of palladium participation.

Such obligatory actions are integral<br/>to the security procedures of many enterprises. The management of<br/>obligations in security policies imposes significant technical<br/>challenges since obligations bear quite different properties from<br/>traditional access control. For example, obligations assigned to<br/>users often cannot be enforced. Thus, even if a system°Øs reference<br/>monitor is trusted, the failure of obligations must be considered,<br/>and appropriate remedies need to be an integral part of security<br/>policies. Also, the interaction between obligations and other<br/>components of security policies (e.g., access control) must be<br/>considered to ensure their consistency.<br/><br/>This project develops a comprehensive framework for the management<br/>of obligations in security policies, which covers the full life<br/>cycle of obligations, including obligation modeling, specification,<br/>analysis, monitoring and discharges. Specifically, the project<br/>formally identifies the desirable security objectives that are<br/>characteristic of systems that involve obligations, and<br/>systematically investigates dynamic and static means to maintaining<br/>these objectives while such systems evolve. Though the framework is<br/>formal in nature, and is designed on purpose to be general, the<br/>evaluation of its usefulness and effectiveness is firmly grounded on<br/>real applications, in particular, in the context of privacy policy<br/>enforcement in health care systems.<br/><br/>This project aims to establish a solid foundation for the management<br/>of obligations, and significantly improve the understanding and<br/>practice of obligations in information systems. The societal benefit<br/>of the project also results from the development and dissemination<br/>of education resources on new types of security policies beyond<br/>traditional access control.

McMahon of the University of Wisconsin-Madison. This research will explore the structure, reactivity, and spectroscopy of carbon-rich molecules in organic chemistry. Prof. McMahon, his students, and their collaborators, will synthesize new molecules that are highly reactive by virtue of their unusual bonding. They will determine their spectroscopic properties, elucidate their characteristic thermal and photochemical reactivity, and, search for their existence in flames and in interstellar space. These studies impact diverse areas of chemical and physical science, including astrochemistry, flames and combustion, and soot formation.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of this research involves the training the next generation of graduate and undergraduate students in the study of complex chemical problems as part of an interdisciplinary research team. Training in mechanistic organic chemistry also provides a valuable foundation for subsequent careers in industry or academia. Half of Prof. McMahon's former coworkers are employed in the chemical or pharmaceutical industry, half hold faculty positions in academia and a large number have been women. Prof. McMahon and his coworkers will continue their engagement in a variety of science education and outreach activities, including the development of research collaborations with minority students and faculty at Howard University, Spelman College, and Xavier University of Louisiana.

This collaborative research project will investigate the intersection of Islamism and capitalism and its geopolitical and cultural implications through a multi-sited case study of the new Turkish veiling-fashion industry and its transnational connections to Berlin, Paris and Amsterdam.  Turkish producers of veiling-fashion, which is fashionable Islamic dress for women, have begun to export their products to retail outlets in the Middle East, Europe, and North America.  The investigators will analyze the scope, history, and geography of the veiling-fashion industry headquartered in Turkey by tracing out the circuits of production, design, sales, and finance that characterize the industry.  They also will explore the implications of the production, sale, and consumption of veiling-fashion for geopolitics, geoeconomics, and identity formation in a transnational context.  The investigators will employ a multi-method research design with four components:  (1) a survey of the veiling-fashion industry in Turkey; (2) interview-based case studies of three transnational veiling-fashion companies (Tekbir, Aydan, and Dicle); (3) focus groups with consumers of Turkish veiling-fashion in Istanbul, Paris, Berlin, and Amsterdam; and (4) the production and analysis of a veiling-fashion archive of catalogues, brochures, advertisements, company reports, and fashion shows.<br/><br/>This research project will provide an empirically grounded assessment of the effects of transnational Islamic businesses and the rise of veiling-fashion amongst Muslim women in contemporary Europe and Turkey.  More broadly, project results will illuminate the geopolitical and geoeconomic implications of the transnationalization of Islamic practices and identities.  The project will focus on the structure and dynamics of the veiling-fashion industry and the role of Islamic business practices, economic governance, and workplace regulations at each stage in the global commodity chain.

However, the development of aquatic sensing networks is significantly lagging terrestrial counterparts. It is widely recognized that an aquatic counterpart to low cost, low power, wireless radios is needed to advance the state-of-the-art in underwater sensor networks. Unfortunately, there are few open-architecture, low power and low cost underwater acoustic modems. <br/><br/>This project looks at an alternative hardware platform for wireless underwater communication. Reconfigurable devices will be used to create a software defined acoustic modem (SDAM) ? the underwater counterpart to software defined radios being proposed for future generations of terrestrial communications. The SDAM can be remotely programmed, which enables adaptive sensing capabilities and changes to the network without physically retrieving the device. Since the communication protocol is programmed into the modem, the same SDAM board can be used for a variety of different underwater environments. <br/><br/>The ultimate goal is to develop a prototype SDAM that uses a reconfigurable device for physical layer processing. This requires careful design of a system architecture that can communicate with the sensors, interface with acoustic transducer(s), efficiently compute physical layer algorithms, and provide services to the rest of the network stack. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of this project center around the incorporation of embedded and reconfigurable computing systems into course material, and the use of the SDAM for ecological research, which enables long-term understanding of many ecological processes, including the effects of environmental degradation and climate change on coastal and lake ecosystems.

Several of the proposed projects are highly interdisciplinary and will yield broadly-applicable results. These projects include: (1) quantification of oligodynamic action and the characterization of novel, environmentally-safe organometallic plastics with potential biocidal properties (slowing or inhibiting biofilm formation), which would be relevant to the development of antifouling marine coatings or improved materials for medical devices; (2) the study of a newly-discovered component involved in iron transport in biological systems, which will result in a new understanding of how this essential element is utilized in living tissue, and may lead to new treatment methods for various iron-related disorders such as anemia or hemochroma-tosis; (3) the study of highly-reactive oxygen species that are implicated in mutation and aging, which would open new vistas in cancer research and in the field of geriatrics; and (4) the study of structure reactivity relationships at the active site in engineered cytochrome proteins, which will provide insight to better understand how proteins adopt the critical shapes required for biological activity. <br/><br/><br/>Non-Technical Abstract<br/><br/>We seek to acquire instrumentation that will allow us, through various projects, to study magnetic properties of electrons in different environments. Several of these projects are interdisciplinary, and involve inorganic chemistry, organic chemistry, biochemistry, micro-biology, and/or materials science. Other projects focus on the study of how some types of reactions take place. One of the more broadly-based projects will establish a correlation between certain toxic metals which have been chemically incorporated into plastics, and how rapidly a slimy coating, produced by bacteria, forms in a water environment. This slimy coating is known as a biofilm, and is involved, for example, in the attachment of barnacles to ships and the clogging of tubing used in medical devices in a process called biofouling. We will use the results of our studies to design environmentally safe materials and coatings that slow or stop biofouling. Other projects with broad applications include (1) the study of a newly-discovered molecule involved in the movement of iron in living tissue; (2) the study of specialized oxygen-containing molecules that may be involved in mutation and aging processes; and (3) the study of biochemically-engineered molecules to learn more about how such molecules work. We consider the teaching of research to be essential, and participation in research is required for all academic degrees awarded in our department. Thus, our students - many of whom are women and under-represented minority students - will receive hands-on experience with equipment that is widely used in industry, oil exploration, medicine, forensics, and other 'real-world' applications.
0728766	Collaborative Proposal: Diapycnal Mixing on the East Pacific Rise	OCE	PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY	08/01/2007	05/24/2011	Andreas Thurnherr	NY	Columbia University	Standard Grant	Eric C. Itsweire	07/31/2012	$326,306.00		ant@ldeo.columbia.edu	2960 Broadway	NEW YORK	NY	100276902	2128546851	GEO	1610	0000, OTHR	$0.00	Observational studies indicate that mid-ocean ridges are sites where hydrodynamic processes act to enhance turbulent mixing. Previous studies have included measurements from slow-spreading ridges in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans, where the ridges are characterized by very rough topography with deep axial valleys and fracture-zone canyons. The interaction of tides with such topography gives rise to baroclinic currents, which locally enhance the internal-wave energy and increase the potential for instabilities that lead to turbulent mixing. Internal- wave driven mixing of this type has become the paradigm for the occurrence of turbulence in the deep ocean, and has been the basis for parameterizations of diffusivity for use in ocean models. However, recent work has demonstrated that the exceptional levels of turbulent mixing occurring at mid-ocean ridges may also be attributable to low-frequency flow, in particular on slow-spreading ridges where innumerable sills and constrictions support density driven overflows. The main goals of study is to make new observations to document the mixing processes acting on the fast-spreading East Pacific Rise (EPR) which, in comparison to slow-spreading ridges, is associated with much smoother topographic relief. The comparatively less rough topography prevents the considerable enhancement of internal wave energy seen elsewhere, leading previous studies to suggest only weak mixing near the EPR. However, a tracer-release experiment, conducted as part of the NSF-supported LADDER project, demonstrated turbulence levels corresponding to diffusivities of order 10 cm2 s-1, two orders of magnitude above typical thermocline levels. Observations of strong flow, shear, and velocity finestructure suggest that strong turbulence at this site extends beyond a simple bottom boundary layer, and contributes to significant mixing of stratified water above the ridge topography. The sampling program will consist of microstructure and lowered acoustic Doppler profiling, yielding both direct estimates of the turbulent dissipation rates and finestructure parameters. The microstructure measurements will be the first to characterize dissipation levels at any fast-spreading ridge site. We have the unique opportunity to join the final cruise of the LADDER program and contribute new measurements within the framework of existing and funded shiptime.<br/>Intellectual Merits: In spite of several decades of research, mixing in the deep ocean remains poorly characterized. In particular, all available measurements on which current roughness- based mixing parameterizations are based, were taken on slow-spreading ridges where different processes have been implicated in the observed high levels of mixing. Therefore, it is entirely unknown to what degree these parameterizations apply on fast-spreading ridges. The proposed microstructure survey will thus significantly extend the available mixing data set from the deep ocean to sites with different topographic characteristics. The measured dissipation rates will be used to improve mixing parameterizations to be used in numerical circulation and climate models.<br/>Broader Impacts: In addition to the physical process characterization and resulting implications for process parameterization in models, this study contributes in a fundamental way to the LADDER study of larval dispersion near active hydrothermal sites. The proposed work will also support a graduate student at FSU and a postdoctoral investigator at LDEO.

This efficiency is also impacted by how photosynthesis and respiration interact through sharing of reactants and products. This project will examine the resistances to CO2 diffusion in leaves and interactions between photosynthesis and respiration through analyses of how leaves differentially use heavy and light isotopes of carbon in CO2, a task that has become easier, faster, and less expensive with the development of a new technology - the tunable diode laser spectrometer (TDL). Recent discoveries suggest that providing high light intensities to a leaf immediately preceding a dark period can have a large effect on the exchange of isotopes during darkness. This implies a larger role of the enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) than is expected and this could impact interpretation of isotopic data used to measure internal leaf resistance to CO2 diffusion and interactions between photosynthesis and respiration. Daily and seasonal variation in carbon isotope usage by woody and herbaceous species will be analyzed along with plants containing high amounts of PEPC. This study will help to define the role of PEPC in controlling isotopic usage by plants and its influence on photosynthetic and respiratory interactions.<br/><br/>Broader impacts: In addition to potential crop improvements, increases in understanding of isotopic exchange within leaves will refine the fundamental assumptions used to understand ecosystem metabolism and generate data needed to model regional carbon cycles. The TDL is straightforward and inexpensive to use making it ideal for classroom education and laboratory training of graduate and undergraduate students at the University of New Mexico (a Minority Serving Institution where 36% of UNM Biology's 1300 majors are Hispanic and another 7% are Native American) and at Portland State University (where many students are the first member of their family to attend college or are non-traditional re-entry students). Experience with this equipment will help prepare students for research careers at universities, national labs, and in the private sector.

Biological ion channels are themselves nanofluidic devices; however, the level of complexity present in such channels obscures the properties that are the basic essentials of an ion-selective nanochannel. Ion permeation of nanochannels will be studied as a general phenomenon, starting with the simplest model for a nanochannel and increasing the complexity of the model in a stepwise manner by adding attributes that will permit answering some of the questions that are being asked about nanofluidic devices.. Simplified pore models permit investigation of the primary characteristics of a conduction pathway: the shape, radius, and length of the pore, the chemical (hydrophobic or hydrophilic) nature of the pore wall surface, its surface roughness and flexibility, the presence and distribution of surface charges, the presence of an external electric field. <br/>Broader Impact: Recent advances in the fabrication of confined fluidic systems such as nanoscale lab-on-a-chip devices and nanofabricated pores raise fundamental questions about ion transport in nanochannels. Solvent slip along the hydrophobic walls of the carbon nanotube is controlled by fluid-wall interactions. Investigation of such slip flow behavior and other characteristics of flow in nanotubes can be vital for generating the high throughput rates required in nanofluidic devices employing carbon nanotubes. In addition similar issues play an important role in transport processes in biological membranes, and cellular functions. This research will provide training for undergraduate and graduate students and will prepare highly skilled technical personnel with broad knowledge encompassing engineering, chemistry, biology, and nanotechnology. The PIs have been actively participating in the WISEST (Women in Science and Engineering System Transformation) program at UIC and will continue those activities through this grant.

The goal is to quantify the impact of land-use changes, in particular those due to desertification, on the magnitude of dust emissions, loading in the atmosphere and deposition to the Pacific Ocean. Empirical analyses will be carried out using data collected over the dust source regions in China to investigate the relationships among the sources. The Model of Atmospheric Transport and Chemistry (MATCH, v. 4.2) will be used to simulate dust emissions, transport, and deposition with the improved source emission functions.<br/> The results from this work will contribute to a better understanding and prediction of the impacts of changes in dust sources on atmospheric composition and climate. Dust is also an important source of iron, a critical nutrient for phytoplankton growth, in the surface waters of several large regions of the global ocean, so a better quantification of the aeolian iron source has significant impacts on research in global biogeochemical cycles. In addition, this project will foster international collaboration and the sharing of data.

Information technology is pervasive throughout this process. Before beginning the laboratory work, computation is necessary for planning the experiment, and for later analysis of the results.  In gene chip experiments for determining gene activity levels, planning issues include which biological hypotheses should be considered and what chemical conditions will yield the most informative results, followed by computation to reduce the collected data, which can be gigabytes of information, to forms that can be understood and exploited by biological scientists.  In electron microscope experiments for determining the 3-D structure of viruses, planning issues include electron energy, defocus level, beam current, number of tilts, and tilt angles, followed by computation to reduce the measured data, which can be one hundred thousand or more images, to a biologically-plausible 3-D structure.  Historically, insufficient attention has been devoted to the use of highly sophisticated information technology for quantitative planning and analysis of experiments, which jointly takes into account the behavior of the measurement apparatus, the goals of the experiment, the unavoidable uncertainty in the system, and the algorithmic complexity that a particular experimental design implies for the subsequent computational analysis of the experimental data.  The research objective of this ITR project is to bring together a team of investigators from MIT, Purdue and NYU-Courant along with their industrial collaborators to apply principles from information, coding and systems theory, along with advanced computational methods for statistical inference and numerical optimization, to create a unified approach to planning and analysis of complex quantitative experiments in the biological sciences, such as the determination of gene expression using gene chips and the determination of 3-D viral structure from scattering and electron microscopy experiments. These biological problems will challenge the state of the art in information technology and an important characteristic of the project is the parallel development of new information technology and new biological applications. The human-resources objectives of this ITR project are to provide the opportunity for undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral associates to learn about and contribute to this exciting area at the interface between information technology and biological sciences. Because of the biological focus of the research it is anticipated that the proposed project will be an outstanding opportunity to recruit women and other underrepresented minorities into the Systems, Information and Computer Science endeavor.  <br/><br/>

Because such data bases never have identical content, it is necessary to write transforms (or adaptors) to convert such disparate data into a common form. The construction of such transforms is widely believed to be a major cost of data integration projects. <br/>The purpose of the Morpheus project is to capture a large number of such transforms in a repository by crawling the web for publicly available ones and providing high level tools for efficient transform construction. In addition, powerful browsing tools are anticipated that allow users to locate interesting transforms quickly in the repository by providing keyword search of documentation, search within a classification hierarchy of transforms, search by the provenance of transforms, as well as search by the input/output characteristics. <br/>Morpheus is expected to dramatically reduce the cost of writing and maintaining data integration transforms, which will ease the difficulty of future data integration projects. <br/>This project will support graduate students at both Massachusetts Institute of Technology and University of Florida. In addition, transform construction will be used as student exercises in data base classes at both institutions. Further information can be obtained from the project web site: http://www.cise.ufl.edu/~jhammer/morpheus/ where research results will be disseminated and prototype code will be available.

The core of this project is to use computational geometry and optimization techniques to develop efficient algorithms for solving a set of challenging computational problems, such as ensemble clustering, median graph, generalized maximum common subgraphs, geometric fitting, matching, and rigid substructure extraction. This project will yield a set of efficient algorithms and optimization methods for the proposed problems. The designed algorithms and techniques will be used as automatic (or semi-automatic) tools to accurately and reliably analyze the nucleus organization and dynamics, and help understanding the coordination of genomic expression. The set of algorithms and techniques will be implemented and tested using randomly generated data and real biological data. The algorithmic tools and optimization methods from this project will be used to study the nucleus of living cells. It could potentially lead to significant biological discoveries and help us to better understand the mechanism cancers and their relationship with chromosome organization and dynamics. This project will bring research and educational opportunities to both graduate and undergraduate students. It will involve several graduate students and undergraduate students, from both Computer Science and Engineering and Biological Sciences Departments.

The research will answer specific questions about the effect of asymmetry and the effects of certain disease states, which affect the constitutive properties of the cells or the plasma, on their dynamics. The investigators will use an advanced spectral-boundary-element algorithm for Stokes flow that they have developed in the past (with NSF support) to study the dynamics of red blood cells in the microcirculation. They will target the dynamics of single and multiple non-axisymmetrically constrained cells in capillaries, which is important for transport and dynamics in the microcirculations, and the impacts of physiologic changes induced by malaria and several diseases that alter plasma viscosity. <br/><br/>Better quantitative understanding of the dynamics of blood cells in healthy and diseased states will have obvious and beneficial impacts in health. Also, the PI's group is admirably diverse and this project will allow him to continue to train a diverse set of PhD students. The undergraduate students will be recruited into the research and the PI will incorporate the research into undergraduate classes.

Princeton	NJ	085442020	6092583090	CSE	7354	7354, 9218, HPCC	$0.00	The goal of this project is to lay out strategies and abstractions for developing lower-level system modeling and parameter tuning techniques, and for linking these to higher-level architectural and system management approaches. The project also aims to back existing post-manufacturing tuning techniques with deeper analytic methods, and to augment these one-time adjustments with more dynamic management techniques that are ongoing as the system is in use. To make the shift from very static (one-time) tuning towards very dynamic (ongoing) power-performance tuning, one needs models whose detail and abstraction vary. This allows fast, but abstract models to be used dynamically by the operating system, in order to dynamically adjust power/thermal behavior in order to stay within budget while also meeting performance goals. Microarchitectural techniques can also be employed, but likewise need to be informed by good models and measurement techniques to guide their use. The project will address these modeling issues and the associated on-the-fly management techniques.<br/><br/>The research program pursues broad impact in several ways. First, the project has an important component for knowledge dissemination and technology transfer. The modeling and management techniques proposed in this project will be disseminated and released for free use. Building on a record of strong support for undergraduate research and underrepresented groups, the PIs will continue and broaden such activities through this collaboration. Because of the geographic proximity of CMU and Princeton, group meetings unifying the two efforts will be possible throughout the project.

These systems provide a range of interaction energies, from weak dative bonding to strong covalent interactions. Information about the frustrated translational and rotational motions of these molecules on the surfaces provides an understanding of the multi-dimensional molecule-surface potential energy surface, and can be used in determining entropic terms for adsorption, energy dissipation mechanisms, transition state energetics, surface diffusion and reaction mechanisms.<br/><br/>Professor Hinch and her coworkers at Rutgers University are using careful measurement of the velocity of back-scattered helium atoms to probe the low energy vibrational motions of molecules on transition metal surfaces.

Typical examples of identities include your name and your social-security number, or your fingerprint/iris-scan, or your address, or your (non-revoked) Public-Key coming from some trusted public-key infrastructure. In many situations, however, where you are defines your identity. For example, we know the role of a bank-teller behind a bullet-proof bank window not because he or she shows us her<br/>credentials but by merely knowing her location. In this proposal, we ask the following question: is it possible to have the geographical position of a party take part in defining the set of credentials<br/>she has? What are the new possibilities in terms of what we can achieve in this setting?<br/><br/>First, we propose to consider the central task in this setting, i.e.,<br/>securely verifying the position of a device. Despite much work in this area, we have preliminary results that show that in the vanilla (i.e., standard) model, the above task (i.e., of secure<br/>positioning) is impossible to achieve.<br/><br/>We propose to study the proof of position in the bounded storage model (i.e. where we assume some bound on the total memory of the adversary).<br/>In this setting, we wish to achieve two tasks: secure positioning, and position-based key exchange. While the question of secure positioning has been asked in the past, no satisfactory answers exist. <br/><br/>The second question (of position-based key exchange) has not been asked in the past. We also ask a broader question: whether position-based Secure Multi-Party Computation can be achieved in this setting.

Two coding schemes (Bales, 1950, IPA; Scheerhorn, Geist, & Teboul, 1994, meeting coding scheme) will be applied to meeting transcripts and analyzed using sequential analytic methodologies. By using both coding schemes, this project will distinguish how interaction accomplishes meeting activities, moving research past the what to the how of meeting processes.<br/><br/>This project will advance research in disciplines studying meetings (organizational behavior, organizational and group communication, organizational psychology, and sociology), which tend to analyze meetings through a decision-making lens. This project is a first step in understanding the scope of what takes place in meetings, and how interaction functions to accomplish meeting activities. This project brings to surface how task and socioemotional dimensions of communication are used to accomplish goals, especially in light of context. Beyond academia, this project will benefit the way social interaction is taught in the classroom and facilitated at work. The research will provide a communicative explanation of the micro processes of group interaction, which is critical for educational application. This research will also provide useful knowledge to practitioners involved in decision making, diplomacy, mediation, and others areas of human interaction.
0728190	Collaborative Research: Investigation and Development of Active Set Prediction Techniques for Nonlinear Optimization	CMMI	OPERATIONS RESEARCH	08/15/2007	08/14/2007	Richard Byrd	CO	University of Colorado at Boulder	Standard Grant	Michael C. Fu	07/31/2011	$239,266.00		richard@cs.colorado.edu	3100 Marine Street, Room 481	Boulder	CO	803031058	3034926221	ENG	5514	073E, 9147, MANU	$0.00	This grant provides funding to support the development of novel algorithms for large-scale nonlinear optimization that are based on fast estimation of active inequality constraints. Many important methods for nonlinear optimization seek to determine which inequality constraints hold as equalities at the solution, so that the problem can be simplified to an equality constrained problem. As the number of inequality constraints grows, the standard approaches, which use quadratic programming, become too slow. Thus one needs to predict the correct active constraints in a more efficient way. The active-set identification techniques developed in this project will be based on the solution of linear programming subproblems and will allow the estimate of the active constraint set to change by many constraints at a time. New general purpose nonlinear optimization algorithms will be developed using these active-set identification techniques. This project will develop software implementations of these algorithms, as well as a general theory of active-set identification that covers these algorithms.<br/><br/>If successful, the proposed research will allow for the solution of significantly larger nonlinear optimization models (particularly problems with many inequality constraints) than can currently be solved using active-set methods. These more powerful algorithms may be applied to previously intractable models arising in areas such as medical imaging, classification, signal processing, chemical process control, power systems management, integrated circuit design and finance. In addition, active set approaches like this will be more effective at making use of a warm start compared with interior point methods. This will be beneficial for quickly solving subproblems that arise in branch and bound methods for mixed integer nonlinear programming. The theoretical framework for active-set identification developed as part of this project will provide a basis for exploring the development of future active-set based algorithms.

The approach seeks to elucidate the electronic structure of bis(imino)pyridine iron derivatives and apply this knowledge to the synthesis of new, more environmentally responsible compounds that are active catalysts for the formation of C-H, C-C and C-Si bonds.  The research will explore the electronic structure and catalytic activity of new structural types such as iron imides, nitrides, diazoalkane complexes and alkylidenes in order to develop catalytic systems that would replace toxic and expensive precious metals with cheaper, more environmentally benign iron compounds. <br/><br/>This research will be carried out in collaboration with Prof. Karl Wieghardt at the Max Plank Institute for Bioinorganic Chemistry in Mulheim, Germany.  Students and postdocs involved in the project will spend time in laboratories at both Cornell and the Max Plank Institute and be exposed to complementary activities in synthesis, spectroscopy and computational methods. An important focus is the development and utilization of a cyber infrastructure designed to facilitate data exchange and management. These activities will serve as the foundation for community outreach including programs for economically disadvantaged students and new scientific opportunities for underrepresented minorities.  <br/>

Behavioral changes are strongly correlated with structural and functional changes in the connections among the cells in the brain, or synapses in the adult brain. Gonadal steroids such as testosterone have been shown to accelerate and induce changes in the strength and number of synapses in areas responsible for learning and memory. The goal of this project is to determine if the presence or absence of testosterone changes synaptic strength among nerve cells in a neural network responsible for social and reproductive behaviors in adults. Synapses will be identified with the latest technology and examined under low and high power microscopes to identify significant changes in the number, function, and source of synapses in the preoptic area, an important integrating structure in this network. Results from these studies will enhance our understanding of the role of gonadal steroids in the regulation of neural function in the adult brain, thus setting the stage for future studies of growth enhancing chemicals and substrates involved in sexual differentiation, aging and injury. This project will offer unique training opportunites in neuroanatomy and will include undergraduates and graduates in the collection, analysis and processing of the results.

Based on recent research that surface fluxes of newly-ventilated water must be partitioned according to the water's residence time in the ocean interior in order to describe correctly how inventories of transient tracers evolve with time, ventilation rate is therefore a distribution and not, as had been thought sufficient until now, a single number representing a bulk flux. This fundamentally changes the estimation problem to a deconvolution for a ventilation-rate distribution that propagates known mixed-layer concentrations to measured interior values.<br/><br/>Oceanographers from Columbia University and University of California at Irvine propose to use CFC, tritium, and radiocarbon transient tracer data, together with gridded temperature, salinity, nutrient, and oxygen data, to estimate the ventilation-rate distributions of the ocean. The ventilation-rate distributions will systematically be estimated for a range of density classes whose outcrops cover most of the global ocean surface. A major part of the proposed work will be a rigorous quantification of the uncertainties due to errors in the data and due to the underdetermined nature of the deconvolutions.<br/><br/>Two deconvolution methods will be employed: A tested parametric approach and a novel application<br/>of the maximum-entropy method. The deconvolution of the ventilation-rate distribution will be constrained on decadal timescales by CFCs, tritium and bomb radiocarbon and by the background radiocarbon on longer timescales. Steady tracers will constrain the ventilation-rate distribution's spatial and seasonal dependence. The maximum-entropy inversions will use a state-of-the-art data-assimilation model to produce a prior guess for the ventilation-rate distribution. This model will also be used to generate realistic synthetic tracer data to quantify the systematic errors of both the parametric and the maximum-entropy deconvolutions. The research will provide a novel comprehensive picture of how the ocean communicates with the atmosphere on timescales of months to millennia and help reconcile disparate previous estimates of ventilation based on the incomplete bulk-flux picture.<br/><br/>The proposed research will provide the first global estimate of the ventilation-rate distribution for the current state of the ocean and a baseline estimate of its uncertainty so that future estimates of variability and climate change in ventilation can meaningfully be assessed. The proposed work will be synergistic with climate research on constraining the oceanic uptake of anthropogenic carbon. A MATLAB toolbox for performing generalized water-mass analysis using the maximum entropy method will be made available to the community. In addition to the primary scientific contributions, the proposed work will provide funding to support the career development of a postdoctoral scholar, and education and training for graduate students in ocean transport diagnostics, data analysis techniques, ocean modeling, and in analyzing the ocean's role in the climate system.

In its short lifespan,<br/>Heegaard Floer homology has already been used to solve numerous problems in<br/>topology, many of which had resisted mathematicians' efforts for decades.<br/>Specifically, it has provided new insight into knot theoretic questions<br/>related to the Seifert genus, fibered knots, Legendrian and transversal<br/>knots, the 4-ball genus of knots and the smooth concordance order. Knot<br/>concordance, introduced by Fox and Milnor in the 1960s, spans the whole<br/>spectrum (of dimensions) of low dimensional topology: concordance studies<br/>knots, 1-dimensional objects in 3-dimensional spaces, up to an equivalence<br/>relation (concordance) which is defined using surfaces and 4-dimensional<br/>manifolds. Despite many efforts, very little is known about the structure of<br/>the concordance group. This project will apply tools from Heegaard Floer<br/>theory to a number of aspects of knot concordance. We will study smooth<br/>concordance of topologically slice knots, concordance of two-component<br/>links, torsion in the knot concordance group. We will also generalize the<br/>current Heegaard Floer techniques by utilizing higher fold branched covers.<br/><br/>Topology is the study of abstract spaces, called manifolds, of various<br/>dimensions. Low dimensional topology focuses on spaces of dimensions up to<br/>four. Knot theory is the study of knottings of loops in 3-dimensional<br/>space. With a long history reaching back to the 19th century, it is<br/>fundamental to many areas of mathematics and physics, and also has<br/>applications in biology and chemistry. Knot concordance encompasses the<br/>study of a series of questions about knots and surfaces bounded by knots.<br/>Heegaard Floer techniques grew out of a synergistic interaction between<br/>mathematics and physics, specifically gauge theories from quantum physics.<br/>Research in the last 30 years has shown that low dimensional topology is in<br/>many ways more mysterious than topology in higher dimensions. The study of<br/>knot concordance reflects much of this complexity inherent in low<br/>dimensions, and advances in our understanding of concordance are likely to<br/>have far-reaching impact in topology.

The rapid growth of computer capability in the past few decades not withstanding, our ability to model three-dimensional wave propagation and scattering involving geometrically complicated dielectric interfaces is severely limited. Mathematically, the wave solutions are usually non-smooth or even discontinuous across the material interfaces, so that our effort in designing efficient algorithms is easily foiled, unless the complex interfaces are properly treated. The complex interfaces and geometries are commonly tackled by using body-fitted grids in the literature. Even though considerable progress has been made in grid generation, the formation of a good quality body-fitted grid system in geometrically complex domain remains a difficult and time-consuming task. Alternatively, in this project, the investigator will explore how to accommodate dielectric interfaces with complex geometries by using Cartesian grids including the staggered Yee grids. The resulting Cartesian grid methods, which in some sense fit the numerical differentiation operators to the complicated geometries, are less well studied in the literature, in contrast to the body-fitted grid methods. The development of high order Cartesian grid methods with complex interfaces being accurately treated, is of imminent practical importance to efficient wave simulations, but remains unsolved. In this project, innovative fourth order Cartesian grid approaches will be constructed based on the matched interface and boundary (MIB) method newly developed by the investigator and his collaborators for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) involving material interfaces or inhomogeneous media. To address a widespread variety of electromagnetic applications, a complete set of fourth order MIB methods will be developed for different electromagnetic formulations including the Helmholtz equation, the wave equation, and Maxwell's equations, and for different scenarios including the transverse magnetic mode, the transverse electric mode, and fully three-dimensional mode. <br/><br/>Computational electromagnetics (CEM), an interdisciplinary field where one witnesses mutual contributions from mathematicians and engineers is of paramount importance for a wide range of applications, including analysis and synthesis of antenna, calculation of radar cross section (RCS), simulation of ground or surface penetrating radar, to name only a few. The proposed numerical approaches aim to address challenging CEM applications involving large-scale and irregularly shaped structures, for which currently existing methods encounter great difficulties. By delivering more accurate and efficient wave simulations, the proposed methods will lead to breakthroughs in resolving long-standing problems in the real CEM applications. Moreover, the proposed methods will have considerable impact on other challenging interface problems in scientific computing, such as the immersed interface and moving interface problems in fluid dynamics, electrostatic interface problems for structural prediction of large biomolecules in computational biology.

The research addresses both, the theoretical foundations of automatic test generation, and practical test and coverage tools for real-time embedded systems. Many signals affecting system behavior may not be observable, or may be difficult to measure online without affecting system behavior, and the system itself may not be easily reset to an initial state to drive different tests. In this research, tasks in the system are modeled as event automata, and the joint event automaton represents the composition of event automata for all tasks in the system. The research is exploring game and control-theoretic techniques to synthesize, from an automatically constructed abstract interaction graph of the implementation, a test director. The test director introduces variable delays in the execution of the system such that a maximal number of coverage goals are met. A testing tool, DIRECT, implements directed real-time testing for embedded systems, combining static analysis (interaction graph construction), control theory (test director construction) and dynamic analysis (online system monitoring in the presence of the test director) to achieve high interaction coverage. In particular, these problems would be studied in a resource-constrained setting, where both online measurements and test director implementation must be optimized for time and space. The tools and techniques would be evaluated on two testbeds available to us: an embedded development platform on top of Lego Mindstorm robots developed by one of the PIs at UC Santa Cruz and a sensor board for marine tracking developed at UC Santa Cruz.

Since 1991, India's 28 states have implemented economic liberalization policies in widely different degrees. The research will capitalize on this diversity within India and will proceed in two stages. The first stage will be to ascertain whether state exposure to the global economy is in fact related to an eroding social welfare environment, as the research suggests. Time series data will be collected on all of India's 28 states, covering the period before the 1991 reforms to 2006. Independent variables will capture exposure to the global economy at the state level (such as foreign direct investment inflows, and % GDP attributed to exports). Dependent variables will include typical social redistribution indicators, such as trends in minimum wage. Much of this data will be collected at various government offices in Delhi. <br/><br/>The second stage of the project will consist of an in depth study of two Indian states: Gujarat and Kerala. The former has undertaken extensive market signaling initiatives to facilitate foreign investment, and the latter has largely kept their border closed to the global economy. Interviews will be conducted with laborers in special economic zones (SEZs) in Gujarat to ascertain how exposure to the global economy has effected working class political participation (such as ability to strike or unionize). Interviews in Kerala will add an element of control over the research.<br/><br/>This project has broad intellectual and social implications. Intellectually, the project will lead to a broader understanding of the impacts of economic globalization on lower class political participation in developing countries overall. The reality today is that most low and middle income countries are developing within a highly globalized economy. Understanding how such development impacts political participation is important to advancing our knowledge on how economic globalization affects the effectiveness and sustainability of democracy. By aligning with civil society organizations in India, the research will also contribute to a further understanding within India of the implications of economic globalization on Indian politics. Given that increased exposure to the global economy has very real life and death consequences for everyday Indians and citizens in developing countries across the globe, this project is timely and important.

The goal of this informal education resource is to inform and engage parents from the three racial/ethnic groups about engineering in a culturally-relevant manner, so that they may take an active role in encouraging their daughters to consider engineering careers. The GUIDE Toolkit will consist of: (1) the GUIDE Handbook, a customized, culturally-appropriate engineering career resource for use with both parents and girls; and (2) GUIDE Workshops to introduce the GUIDE Handbook to parents and girls from the target racial groups at Girl Scout councils and the larger community. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit - GSUSA will introduce more girls to the field of engineering, with the expectation that more girls will decide to enter the engineering education pipeline, choosing engineering careers in the future. Because GSUSA serves girls from the age of five through 17, the organization has the unique advantage of being able to introduce girls to STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) at the critical time in their educational development - before they lose interest. Stimulating early interest in STEM subjects positively correlates with the likelihood of choosing those subjects as career paths. GSUSA efforts will help reduce the existing gender inequity in STEM career fields and increase the U.S. engineering workforce, competitive edge, and contribute to the diversity of engineering workforce and the diversity of thought overall. <br/><br/>Broader Impact - As the preeminent organization for girls in the U.S., introducing girls to STEM is a program priority. The Toolkit will enhance GSUSA efforts to accomplish this with three key racial/ethnic groups. Currently, 323,822 of GSUSA members are African American, 271,831 are Hispanic, and 30,613 are Native American. As an organization that has an extensive national network of councils that is now being utilized by 10% of the U.S. girl population, GSUSA is in a unique position to leverage informal education resources to change the way girls perceive STEM subjects. The GUIDE Toolkit will also be distributed through other youth serving organizations such as 4H, the Boys and Girls Club of America, Girls Inc, and National Research Center for College and University Admissions (NRCCUA).

ICES promotes and coordinates research by experts within its nineteen member countries on both sides of the Atlantic. The U.S. has been a member since 1912 (with a break during and after WWII). The U.S. role in ICES has become more important with the years, as major practical concerns such as fisheries and pollution have become oceanic in scale and in research programs. NSF has traditionally supported participation of academic U.S. scientists in committees, working groups, and scientific sessions under the auspices of ICES and SCOR, where their input is most beneficial to U.S. fisheries and ocean research interests. Through this proposal U.S. scientists from the academic research community will be selected and funded to attend ICES Working Groups and Statutory Meetings in 2008-2010.

The primary goal of this experiment is to make long-term observations of detailed evolutions of internal waves, instabilities, and mixing at time scales from 1-min to months and at vertical scales from 0.5 m to O(100) m below the equatorial cold tongue. The tongue of cold water straddling the equator in the eastern Pacific is one of the major sea surface temperature (SST) features influencing tropical air-sea interactions. Vertical turbulent fluxes through the base of the surface mixed layer are major factors in the heat budget that determines SST. Strong turbulence during La Nina cools the mixed layer, strengthening the cold tongue. Weak turbulence during El Nin1 allows the mixed layer to warm, weakening or erasing the cold tongue. Several periods of intensive microstructure profiling discovered the role of small-scale mixing in modulating the cold tongue, but attempts to parameterize the turbulent fluxes failed because the physics leading to instabilities and turbulence has not been captured by these measurements. Previous observations indicate that internal waves play the key role by providing the finescale shear that trigger instabilities. High spatial and temporal resolutions of measurements, sufficiently capturing instabilities below the cold tongue, are needed, but have not been made.<br/><br/>In the present experiment, shear and strain will be measured at 1-minute intervals over vertical scales of O (1-100) m and turbulent scalar diffusion rates immediately beneath the surface mixed layer in the cold tongue. Co-investigators Moum and Nash at OSU have recently developed a moored microstructure package that can reliably measure turbulent scalar diffusion rates in the equatorial undercurrent. Closely vertically spaced instruments measuring velocity, temperature, salinity and mixing rates will be mounted on a surface mooring. The mooring will be 5 miles from the long-term TAO mooring at 0 140 W. The experiment will be coordinated with another funded observational program. In spring 2008, 10 pods, evenly spaced between 30 and 90-m depth, will be deployed on the long-term TAO mooring at 0 140 W. The deployment will be Immediately with18 days of shipboard microstructure profiler measurements.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit.<br/>Internal waves produce much of the diapycnal mixing in the ocean and must be understood and quantified before accurate mixing parameterizations can be developed. In the eastern equatorial Pacific, the stratified high-shear zone between the undercurrent core and the base of the mixed layer provides a unique environment for internal waves. Understanding it well enough to accurately parameterize the diapycnal mixing is a major intellectual challenge whose solution will advance the general understanding of internal waves, instabilities, and turbulence, as well as provide necessary support for climate studies.<br/><br/>Broader Impact<br/>This work is expected to lead to more accurate parameterizations of equatorial mixing in general circulation models (GCM) and thus to more realistic climate models. SST, air-sea interaction, and ENSO in the cold tongue are strongly controlled by the turbulence entrainment flux. To improve the large-scale model prediction of ENSO, we need to understand the physics of instabilities and turbulence and improve the turbulence parameterization in GCMs. The proposed project will provide support for the education of a graduate student. The observations and analysis results will be published on a publicly accessible website.

Photophysical, photochemical, and computational studies will be performed in order to assess the factors that are important for establishing structure-luminescence relationships in tunable systems. The broad tunability previously observed in d10-d10 complexes will be extended to d8-d10 exciplexes in order to determine the dependence of tunability on the following factors: a) cations of different charge (+1, +2, +3); b) different d8-d10 metal ions; c) complexes prepared from different solvents; and d) the thiocyanate ligand (SCN-) vs. cyanide (CN-) ligand. Photophysical energy transfer studies will be investigated between d8-d10 donor exciplexes and lanthanide ion acceptors. The photochemical reactions of the luminescent metal-metal bonded exciplexes will be studied in the solid state and doped in alkali halides at room and cryogenic temperatures. At the heart of the investigation are time-independent and time-resolved luminescence studies, thermal analysis, Raman scattering and infrared analysis, X-ray and neutron scattering structural studies, and electronic structure calculations. The project is expected to provide a) criteria for tunable systems with strong luminescence intensities; b) new luminescent exciplexes; and c) new insights into closed-shell metallophilic interactions. A better understanding of these factors will aid in the design of tunable solidstate systems for photonic applications. <br/><br/>The results of this research will provide useful information that can lead to the design of new solid state tunable photonic systems and other useful devices based on the luminescent phenomena. Training of undergraduates, graduate students, and post-doctoral researchers in a variety of instruments and techniques that will be important in nanoscale science and engineering will also be provided through the proposed research.

The occurrence and severity of an ESF event depends on the condition of the local equatorial ionosphere, as well as that of the plasma in electrical contact with it (namely, the off-equatorial E region) through coupling within the appropriate magnetic flux tube. Convective plumes of turbulent plasma that develop during strong ESF events can degrade communications from high frequencies to the L-band and can last for several hours as the plumes drift with the background plasma. A major current area of interest relates to the causal mechanisms that drive the day-to-day variability of ESF. ESF has been convincingly linked to variations in the strength of the pre-reversal enhancement (PRE), which is an increase in the vertical drift velocity during the post-sunset period that drives equatorial plasma to higher altitudes where conditions are more conducive to instability. This project focuses on global measurements of E-region densities and applies them to understand the day-to-day and longer-term variability of ESF. The global measurements will come from instruments onboard the COSMIC (Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate) satellites and will include high-resolution Global Positioning System occultation measurements of the total electron content (TEC), ultra-violet photometer measurements related to the integrated ionospheric electron density, and tri-band TEC measurements along the trajectory of the satellite. The measurements will be combined using tomographic inversion and data assimilative techniques to estimate the two-dimensional distribution of electron density, including the horizontal plasma density gradients of the E region densities. Results will be validated and errors and resolutions quantified using ground-truth measurements from the Arecibo and Jicamarca radars. One of the project's broader impacts lies in the database of E region densities that will be assembled which could be useful for global assimilation models and perhaps important in reproducing equatorial ionospheric variability, particularly in terms of prediction. A graduate student will be involved in the projectas well as a new young investigator for whom this is the first proposal as principal investigator

This award coordinates with a collaborative award funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) through a joint program between the NSF and DFG that funds collaborative projects between US and German investigators.<br/><br/>The focus of the collaboration is to better understand how molecules are separated based on their chemical and physical properties using materials based on silica. The separation media will be studied mainly by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, a technique that can measure how various types of compounds interact with the silica surface. Varying degrees of interaction between the surface of silica particles and the molecules present in a mixture result in separation of these compounds and provide a means of analysis. Modification of silica surfaces can be used for controlling the separation of various types of mixtures. Understanding these processes will lead to the development of better separation materials to be used in the analysis of complex mixtures encountered in pharmaceutical, clinical, environmental and biological samples. A key component in the collaboration will be the involvement of students who will have an opportunity to work in a multi-disciplinary international research project. Exchanges of students between the two laboratories will enhance the collaborative research experiences of the participants. <br/><br/>The award is co-funded by the Office of International Science and Engineering at NSF.

Although both physical stimuli and a person's behavioral responses are relatively easy to observe, a preeminent problem is to gain a handle on the unobservable intervening sensation. For example, if a patient judges a pain to be 4 on a 10-point scale, is that twice as much pain as a 2? Or, if two people judge a pain to be 4, how can we compare their experiences? For more than a century, these general issues have been studied intensely. Despite that long history and considerable progress, the problems are still far from completely solved, in part, because much past research has not been expressed in the form of testable foundational assumptions, formulated as explicit mathematical laws. The elaboration and testing of such is pivotal to progress in many areas of psychological science. <br/><br/>With support of the National Science Foundation, Drs. Duncan Luce, Louis Narens, and Ragnar Steingrimsson will continue their work in establishing a general, empirically-based, mathematically-expressed foundation of psychological measurement. In particular, the investigators will apply their general approach to the study of sensations. Experiments in both the auditory and visual domains will be used to evaluate the adequacy of behavioral axioms and, thus, of the numerical representations derived from them. The research extends their theoretical and empirical work to several topics including the effects of temporal or spatial order of stimulus presentation, sequential effects, and evaluating how observations obtained using different methodologies are related. An important aspect is the adequacy with which representations can accommodate individual differences without any statistical fitting of unspecified functions and free parameters. Successful progress on this program promises much unification of now separate theories, notably those involving intensity, frequency, and presentation order, and theories that treat those in a domain-specific fashion, and the relations between and evaluation of different methodologies.

Aiming to lead to advances in human cognition, perception and action, image processing, intelligent systems, and human-computer interaction, the infrastructure enables interdisciplinary research on novel computational models of visual parsing, categorization, cognition, and as well as research for motor planning and execution. Aiming to achieve novel computational models for implementing humanlike intelligent systems, the project supports research in understanding visual processing in humans during task execution. The instrumentation is composed of three modules: A<br/>. High-resolution immersive screen where virtual scenarios can be simulated for sensing human performances,<br/>. Head-mounted eye tracker system for accurately tracking the navigation of the user's visual attention point, and<br/>. Full-body occlusion-free inertial motion-capture equipment for capturing the motions of the user during performances.<br/>Understanding human-like intelligence is key for the development of seamless and fully integrated attentive user interfaces, affective collaborative work, and many human-computer interaction (HCI) applications needed in the future. Connected to a software architecture dedicated to the motion control and graphical simulation of human-like virtual agents already under development, the equipment supports interdisciplinary research activities such as:<br/>. Analyzing the visual parsing of features in images,<br/>. Analyzing the interactions between gaze and gestures for describing features and procedures, and<br/>. Developing new vision-based motor control algorithms for the coordination of locomotion and reaching during grasping tasks.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The infrastructure greatly benefits the newest campus of the UC system. The institution services an underrepresented population where the students are usually first generation college students. The facility provides valuable programming and lab skills that contribute to success in high tech jobs and graduate schools. It also improves instruction and development of courses and enables research for many application domains, including training, delivery of instruction, ergonomics, entertainment, HCI, and education.

While the project is not explicitly focused on developing more effective pedagogy in such workshop spaces, it does seek to describe the ways in which connections between scholars and the public have shaped what counts (scientifically) as historical accuracy. This is a particularly significant history to articulate because many of the participants in such workshops, especially those in Antigua, have been Maya, an underrepresented and politically disenfranchised group in Guatemala, Mexico, and the United States. While the linguistic knowledge of these workshop participants has played an irreducible role in hieroglyphic decipherment, they have received little in the way of material compensation and recognition of intellectual and cultural property. To the contrary, the narratives of ancient Maya violence produced by epigraphers have been used to rationalize ongoing state marginalization of indigenous communities. This project will show how such scientific knowledge has been used in unexpected ways to further disadvantage those that it claims to represent.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit. The proposed historical ethnography brings the perspectives of science and technology studies (STS) to bear on a new topical area: the decipherment of ancient Maya hieroglyphs. In so doing, the project relays the concerns of STS into the production of historical knowledge. While historical accounts of Maya hieroglyphic decipherment have emerged recently, their authors have all been actively involved in the process of decipherment and subsequent developments within the field of epigraphy. Such authors have produced narrow historical narratives of epigraphy's progressive accumulation of knowledge, without accounting for the diverse participants included in the scientific process. In contrast, this ethnographic treatment seeks to document the differentially interested participants in the process of decipherment and the subsequent uses of hieroglyphic knowledge outside of academic conversations. This will be accomplished through an ethnographic methodology combining interviews with scholars, enthusiasts, and Maya involved in three series of collaborative scientific workshops, and narrative analysis of published and unpublished documents produced and dispersed in such workshop spaces. The proposed phases of research extend ethnographic and archival research already conducted. Ultimately, this project uses the conceptual resources of STS and the empirical commitment of ethnography to help render the scientific process and societal consequences of hieroglyphic knowledge production more transparent. <br/><br/>Broader Impact. As ethnography is an intrinsically collaborative field, this study will seek to develop partnerships with those who have been involved in workshops, striving to ensure that the history that is produced feeds back into the process of workshop pedagogy. The work will be publicly presented in English and Spanish at conferences attended by Maya scholars and activists in the United States and Guatemala. Finally, in addition to academic presentations and publications, research reports will be produced for public distribution in English and Spanish on the website of the Maya Exploration Center (www.mayaexploration.org), a nonprofit organization that sponsors Maya research and study abroad opportunities.

However, there is much to be gained by supporting a style of networking that does not require an end system to maintain full, ongoing connectivity in order to maintain its network presence. In this project we explore a style of networking that we term selectively-connected, by which we mean an end system, can knowingly manage the extent of its network connectivity in response to internal or exterior events, as it anticipates changes in connectivity.<br/><br/>While selectively-connected networking also has applications for end systems that enter outage periods (e.g., a user closing a notebook, or a mobile device entering no-coverage area), one highly significant form of operation it can enable concerns placing end systems into some degree of sleep in order to operate with much greater energy efficiency. Such sleeping not only can benefit portable devices by greatly extending their battery lifetime, but can also realize energy savings at a national scale by enabling desktop systems and set-top devices to enter states of greatly reduced processing without sacrificing their network presence.<br/><br/>In this project the researchers undertake initial designs of new architectural components for better supporting selectively-connected networking, by which sleeping hosts can retain their standing in the network or delegate agents to act on their behalf during their absence. These span: exposing selective connectivity; evolving soft state into notions of proxyable or limbo state; facilitating host-based control; introducing assistants to work in concert with sleeping end systems; exploring primitives that applications might use to express the semantics they wish to preserve when selectively-connected; and considering network links that can themselves sleep when the end systems they serve are likewise sleeping.

The Girls Communicating Career Connections (GC3) project?s media series--short video segments produced by middle school aged girls--will capture the inquiry-based learning experiences of girls, as they investigate what it means to be a scientist or engineer. The videos will encourage girls to see the science in their everyday lives, its relevance to things most important to them now (e.g., sports, art, music), and leverage that connection to spark interest in, and knowledge of, science and engineering (S/E) careers. GC3 will also develop a robust companion Educator Web site and supporting materials for formal and informal educators. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit--GC3 brings together high capacity collaborators from formal and informal education, research, youth media and business, who are leaders in their fields and who have rich content and expertise to draw upon. GC3 takes a user and learner centered development approach--youth and their educators will be involved in all aspects of the project's development and distribution. The project builds upon extensive research and previous projects on inquiry-based learning and program development. It leverages experience with powerful, multi-phase, participatory research and uses it to inform the process of creating resources that illustrate replicable ways for young women and their educators to make meaningful discoveries about STEM careers and pathways. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts--GC3, along with its dissemination partners, engages students and educators in thousands of schools and youth-serving organizations around the country in building the nation?s STEM capacity. Teachers and other educators are provided with contextual resources to help them integrate the media series into their classrooms and programs in substantive ways. By highlighting girls from diverse socioeconomic and geographic locations throughout the United States, impact and appeal of the video segments are broad. The series includes bilingual content, as well as closed-captioning and voiceovers for hearing- and visually-impaired viewers, thereby making the videos accessible to the widest audience possible. Ultimately, project GC3 helps girls across the country develop a new curiosity about their world and begin to see connections to their own futures. It encourages them to consider STEM careers and helps them make more informed decisions as they move through the middle to high school transition. By opening doors of exploration into new career options, the videos allow young women to see STEM as a viable part of everyday life, a source of both play and serious academic pursuit.

The work aims to: (i) advance the theory of multimode and strong scattering with an emphasis on situations where the clutter does not satisfy a separation of scales assumption, in particular using the theory of rough paths; and (ii) apply this theory to the use of incoherent waves for imaging in a cluttered environment, focusing on situations where direct application of time reversal does not work, but where related techniques using wave field correlations can be applied. <br/><br/>Many important physical phenomena involve waves propagating through heterogeneous media, such as sound waves in the ocean, seismic waves in the earth's crust, electromagnetic waves propagating through the atmosphere, or ultrasound probing the human body. A good understanding of how waves interact with the heterogeneity is crucial in applications like wireless communication, medical imaging, reflection seismology, remote sensing, atmospheric laser beam propagation, underwater communication, nondestructive testing, fiber optics, nano-technology, seismology, helioseismology, and astronomic imaging. Many, if not most, of the applications mentioned above do not fully exploit a mathematical description of waves in random media, partly because of the complexity of this description. Yet, modern techniques such as time reversal have shown that medium heterogeneity can improve performance. The general objective of the proposal is to further the theory for waves in clutter, the clutter modeled as a random medium, and show how an accurate description of incoherent waves can lead to new or enhanced technologies.

It mainly<br/>develops two programming techniques: Behavior-oriented parallelization<br/>(BOP), which speculatively executes possibly parallel regions, and<br/>Fast track, which uses software speculation to support the use of<br/>unsafely optimized code.<br/><br/>The exponential increase in microprocessor performance over the past<br/>30 years has had incalculable impact on science, commerce, government,<br/>and quality of life. Continuing this revolution through the coming<br/>decade will depend on a large degree of processor-level parallelism.<br/>Behavior-based oftware speculation promises to improve the performance<br/>of existing, sequential software and of new software that reuses an<br/>existing code base. It simplifies parallelization and should thus<br/>improve the productivity of future software development. The outcome<br/>of this proposal will be a suite of techniques for general-purpose<br/>software, and new tools that will be transitioned to industrial<br/>partners wherever possible, and will be used in both undergraduate and<br/>graduate courses.
0722656	MRI: Development of a Superconducting Magnet Coil and a 201 MHz RF Cavity for Testing Muon Ionization Cooling Techniques	PHY	MAJOR RESEARCH INSTRUMENTATION	08/15/2007	08/15/2007	Donald Summers	MS	University of Mississippi	Standard Grant	Kathleen V. McCloud	07/31/2011	$798,819.00	Lucien Cremaldi	summers@phy.olemiss.edu	100 BARR HALL	UNIVERSITY	MS	386771848	6629157482	MPS	1189	0000, 9150, OTHR	$0.00	This proposal is for instrumentation development needed to test techniques to advance the Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment (MICE). In the field of particle physics, there is increasing interest in using particle accelerators to form very intense beams of high-energy muons. Discovered in 1937, the muon, a more massive cousin of the electron, is a subatomic particle, whose simple and well-understood interactions with matter make it a useful probe for a range of purposes. Until now, however, due to its short average lifetime of 2.2 microseconds, it has not been possible to accelerate muons. The key step in demonstrating the feasibility of muon accelerators is the Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment (MICE). The main obstacle to accelerating an intense muon beam is that such beams are created too large to fit into the typical vacuum chamber of a synchrotron and the short muon lifetime leaves little time to adequately shrink and accelerate the beam. Ionization cooling is a new technique to shrink, or cool a muon beam quickly. In this process, a beam of muons passes through selected material in which it loses energy by ionizing nearby atoms. These interactions reduce all three components of a muons velocity: horizontal, vertical, and longitudinal. The muon beam is then accelerated by radio-frequency cavities, replacing only the longitudinal velocity component of the muons. As the horizontal and vertical components are increasingly reduced while the longitudinal component is maintained, the muons trajectories become more nearly parallel, allowing focusing magnets to substantially reduce the size of the beam.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of this proposal includes University of Mississippi students and local QuarkNet teachers who will be involved and will use acoustic sensors to locate and characterize sparking (electrical breakdown) in the RF cavity. Development of muon cooling could lead to building a neutrino factory and discovering CP violation in the lepton sector. Lepton CP violation may quite possibly cause the baryon-antibaryon asymmetry in the universe. A neutrino beam from a Neutrino Factory might be aimed at a detector in the National Science Foundation Deep Underground Science and Engineering Laboratory (DUSEL). This would give the United States a first rate physics project for understanding the universe and for training students.

The term modularity refers to this process: the social, political, and economic effort to create forms of equivalence and commensurability specific to oil-exporting states. She will carry out her research in the central African state of Equatorial Guinea, which has seen 10 billion dollars in petroleum-related investment over the last six years, and is now Africa's third largest oil producer. <br/><br/>The researcher will investigate standardization in three different domains: the use of standard oil technologies; the effects of petroleum income on local politics; and the relationships between the host and investor countries and corporations. She will conduct eighteen months of fieldwork in Equatorial Guinea. Her mixed-methods approach with include an institutional ethnography of an American petroleum corporation operating in Equatorial Guinea; a survey of 300 people connected to the industry; socio-spatial mappings; and in-depth interviews. While others have observed the existence of modularity, this study will be one of the first to examine the processes and activities by it is achieved.<br/><br/>Petroleum is widely understood to be the most lucrative and important industry in the world, inseparable from the largest forms of transnational capital. In 2006, the United States imported more oil from Africa--a continent not often considered central to global capital flows--than it did from the Middle East. Based on research in the geographic core of this phenomenon, this project aims to contribute to research on extractive industries, development studies, ethnography of economic transformation, and debates on material and ideological standardization in global processes. The research also will contribute significantly to the education of a social scientist.

This sense is facilitated by the lateral line system, which is an array of receptors, known as neuromasts, on the surface of the body. Neuromasts appear in a wide variety of shapes and sizes within and among species of fish. However, it is unclear how this variation affects the ability of fish to detect water flow. The aim of the proposed research is to develop a model for the micromechanics of neuromasts that will describe how differences in the form of neuromasts affect their sensitivity. This aim will be achieved by research organized in three stages. In the first stage, experiments will measure material properties of individual neuromasts in the larvae of zebrafish (Danio rerio). In particular, the stiffness of neuromasts will be measured by recording the bending of these structures when loaded with a fine thread of glass. These measurements will be incorporated into a computational model to be developed in the second stage of the project. This model will consider the hydrodynamics of a stimulus, the structural dynamics of the neuromast, and their mechanical interactions in order to predict how a neuromast deflects in response to fluid flow. The third stage of this project will test this model by measuring the deflections and neurobiological signals of neuromasts in response to oscillatory flow over a wide range of frequencies. Once the model has been verified by these experiments, it will provide a basis for interpreting how differences in the size and shape of neuromasts influence the function of the lateral line system. This will allow for consideration of functional changes over the course of developmental and evolutionary transformation. The work will involve student training in an integrative and interdisciplinary area that combines computational approaches with physiological assessment of lateral line function.

The investigator plans to create a model of test design that would be more likely to extract student knowledge from students of varied cultures by expanding the content of items. The study will examine the experience of American Indian groups, Alaska Natives, and Pacific Islanders. The researcher will conduct an analysis of available NAEP data to illuminate any assessment item features associated with patterns of responses among a culturally diverse sample of student responses.
0710835	Towards a Comprehensive Understanding of Episodic Tremor and Slip	EAR	GEOPHYSICS, COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH	08/01/2007	06/18/2009	Gregory Beroza	CA	Stanford University	Continuing grant	Raffaella Montelli	07/31/2011	$279,793.00		beroza@stanford.edu	3160 Porter Drive	Palo Alto	CA	943041212	6507232300	GEO	1574, 7298	0000, 5921, 5978, OTHR, 4444	$0.00	In this research we develop and apply techniques to improve our understanding of a recently discovered phenomenon known as deep, non-volcanic tremor. Deep tremor is a more or less incessant, but weak, shaking of the ground that has been associated with large, but very slow earthquakes. The nature of tremor, with long, but not impulsive, episodes of ground motion requires new and innovative approaches from seismologists because the usual analysis applied to ordinary earthquakes cannot be applied to tremor. We are currently improving methods that have already been developed by the PI and his colleagues, and applying them to tremor in different areas. We are also continue to develop new and improved methods for tremor analysis. Among these are matched-filter analysis of low frequency earthquakes, a running auto-correlation analysis of tremor episodes to detect low frequency earthquakes, and a ''sub-space'' detection algorithm for identifying similar, but not identical small low frequency earthquakes. We use the understanding that emerges from this analysis to address the systematics of tremor behavior of the mechanics of the tremor process. The areas of the proposed study are all areas where tremor occurrence is well documented, specifically: Cascadia, Southwest Japan, and Central California. The strategic location of tremor -- at the boundary of the locked zone where we expect future large earthquakes to initiate -- and the emerging understanding that it represents shear slip on the plate boundary, makes this an important research target with significant potential implications for earthquake forecasting. In particular, an improved understanding should help scientists to assess the significance of deep tremor for earthquake hazard in the Cascadia subduction zone and in central California, where tremor is observed deep under the Cholame segment of the San Andreas Fault, a segment that has not ruptured in over 150 years. <br/><br/>Another important broader impact is the international flavor of this work: U.S. researchers and graduate students will collaborate with researchers at the University of Tokyo, the National Institute for Earth Sciences and Disaster Prevention, and other institutions in Japan on significant portions of this research.

The researchers will collaborate on diverse areas of microelectronics and bioengineering including electromagnetics, MEMS based inductors and probes, analog, mixed-signal IC design and power electronics.<br/><br/>This collaborative project will provide a much broader university and industry experience for the researchers, students and company members.

This proposal explores the hypothesis that smaller grain sizes and microcracking caused by thermal expansion anisotropy (TEA) in HA materials designed for use as bone grafts (1) increase the number and maturation of osteoblast (bone forming) cells adhering to the graft, (2) foster deposition of mineralized tissue and microcrack healing, and (3) promote improved mechanical strength and performance of the graft. These hypotheses are consistent with published and preliminary laboratory findings that definitively identified microcracking in HA, postulated microcracking as a toughening mechanism for brittle ceramics such as HA, demonstrated that HA enhances osteoblast function, and showed increased osteoblast proliferation on nanograined HA. The project has three objectives: (1) To determine the extent of microcrack damage in HA and correlate the microcracking with osteoblast attachment and maturation. (2) To determine the localized occurrence of microcrack healing by osteoblasts on HA and correlate such healing with measurable changes in global and local material properties such as the elastic modulus. (3) To determine the role of grain boundaries on osteoblast attachment and maturation and correlate osteoblast activity with grain size. <br/><br/>BROADER IMPACTS: Approximately 500,000 bone grafts are performed in the United States annually. Common sources for bone graft material, both autografts and allografts, are highly limited by availability, quantity, poor mechanical properties, risk of disease transmission, and cost. There is an urgent need for a biocompatible synthetic engineered bone graft material with adequate mechanical integrity and enhanced healing/bone integration properties. The expectation is that the neobone bioceramic constructs developed in this project, because of their improved morphology and cellular activity, will be a viable synthetic alternative to all currently available graft materials for repair of damaged bone tissue. The project will support two graduate students throughout their doctoral training. The PIs have routinely supported undergraduate research workers on their projects, many of whom have been coauthors on journal articles and conference presentations. Members of the research team will participate each summer in the MSU Summer High School Engineering Institute for Detroit-area students, who include many women and minority participants.

The process variables that control the thickness, composition, surface morphology and uniformity of the emissive NQD film will be investigated in order to establish a NQD-deposition protocol through an understanding of the formation, charging, transport, and coalescence process of the nanoscale droplets in mist-deposition process. The processing of QD-LED devices will be optimized by tailoring the thickness and morphology of NQD-active layers with the mist-deposition process. The LED performance will be characterized and correlated to the process parameters in order to study the ultimate limits of the mist-deposition technology in QD-LED processing. The employment of sequential shadow-mask patterning in the mist-deposition process will be investigated to create RGB-pixel arrays of bright QD-LEDs over large surface areas. The target of this project will be the development of a versatile, efficient, and scalable technique for manufacturing of a full-color, passive matrix QD-LED display.<br/><br/>This research project will address two fundamental, interrelated issues related to QD-LEDs technology: fabrication method and devices. The synergistic approach employed in this study will significantly expand the understanding of nanocrystalline quantum dots processing and device mechanism. The broader impacts of the proposed project go beyond the realm of a purely technical endeavor and are related to the anticipated future role of nanocrystalline quantum dots based devices in everyday life. For instance, technical breakthrough such as flexible displays will have a profound impact on the way we transmit and receive information. A range of new applications that will be made possible due to the improved processing of nanocrystalline semiconductors will create new sizeable markets, and hence, may have a noticeable impact of nation's economy. The proposed study will also provide focused research and learning experience to undergraduate students by involvement in experimental laboratory work, and help them to bridge the fundamental nanoscience with the real-world applications of nanotechnology.

The results will be applied to the study of stochastic volatility models with Levy-driven CARMA volatility and to the further study of COGARCH models. Time series in which the parameters are constant over time-intervals between ``change-points'' constitute an important class of non-stationary time series which has been found particularly useful in hydrology, seismology and finance. Properties and applications of a new estimation technique based on the minimization of the minimum description length of a model that includes the number of change-points and their locations as parameters will be developed and extended to cover a general class of processes with structural breaks of various types. Estimation techniques for all-pass models driven by non-Gaussian noise will also be developed. These techniques, including maximum likelihood and minimum dispersion estimation, will be applied to the problem of identification and estimation for non-causal or non-invertible ARMA models.Adaptive techniques for efficient estimation of such models will be explored.<br/><br/>In the last fifteen years, there has been a widely-recognized need for the development of new models and techniques for the analysis of time series data from scientific, engineering, biomedical, and financial applications. Some of the features required of these new models are nonlinearity, complex dependence structures, strong deviations from normality and non-stationarity. The current proposal addresses these needs. It seeks to enhance understanding of the physical and economic processes represented by the models. The development of efficient estimation and simulation techniques will be an essential component of the research.

The focus is on asynchronous (anytime, anywhere) and minimally facilitated models, because these approaches hold promise for reaching large numbers of teachers in a cost-effective way. The research capitalizes on experiences with BCM's award-winning, high traffic website for educators, BioEd Online. The project will investigate: 1) which asynchronous online professional development delivery methods contribute most strongly to teacher and student science learning; 2) whether linking classroom experiences and discussions to asynchronous online learning significantly enhances teacher and student learning; and 3) whether the effectiveness of different delivery models varies among subpopulations of teachers (demographics, specialization, etc.). The objectives are to: 1) compare the effectiveness of four different online delivery modes for both life and physical science (delivery modes consist of: audio only; video content presentation with slides; content embedded in an online interactive case; and content embedded in video lesson demonstration); 2) investigate whether having teachers teach an inquiry lesson and take part in a discussion forum after completing one of the four delivery modes contributes to greater knowledge gains; 3) examine teacher knowledge gains and abilities to apply knowledge to new problems and student lesson-specific knowledge gains; and disaggregate data by content area (life or physical science), delivery mode and teacher demographics; 4) collect qualitative data about asynchronous models in use by interviewing online providers of science teacher professional development; 5) synthesize and report findings to inform current and future online offerings.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit. Online professional development has potential to meet the needs of large numbers of rural and urban teachers for high quality content and standards-based teaching approaches. Web-based delivery offers convenient access to content, content experts, resources, and participation in communities of teacher-learners. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts. Web-based professional development removes barriers related to distance, time or and local course availability and can serve large numbers of teachers. As many as 1.5 million elementary teachers may need up-to-date science professional development now or in the near future. There is mounting evidence that web-based instruction can be as effective as traditional instruction, even for novice users. The research will inform the field of asynchronous, web-based instruction in science and contribute to the design of best practice models to meet elementary teachers' professional development needs online.

We are automatically acquiring large databases of measurements that span physical scales from the molecule, to the cell, tissue, organism, ecosystem, and beyond to stars and galaxies. However, the rate of acquisition of these data exceeds our ability to analyze them, and many applications are stymied not by the lack of data but by the daunting task of understanding it all. This project addresses the problem of constructing statistical models of such data sets using examples from the data itself. The researchers will study the technical problems associated with constructing statistical modeling in high-dimensional spaces from mathematical and computational points of view. This research will focus on applications of these methods to problems in multidimensional image analysis, including denoising, segmentation, and image synthesis. <br/><br/>This project will develop new algorithms for analyzing large sets of data. These algorithms make very weak assumptions about the statistical structure of data, and instead learn the statistics through large sets of examples, using raw measurements from very high dimensional spaces. The project combines a small team of researchers from probability theory, applied mathematics, and computer science to simultaneously address several important, fundamental questions pertaining to estimates of high-dimensional probability density functions, the computational challenges associated with these estimations, and the applications of these ideas to ongoing problems in science and medicine. The work in probability theory addresses basic questions about probability density functions in very high dimensional spaces. The applied mathematics work is developing methods for approximating these densities through lower-dimensional or sparse representations. The computer science research is examining implementation issues and the application of these methods to a wide range of ongoing problems that demand better algorithms for data analysis.
0721453	NeTS-NBD: Network Coding-Based Protection	CNS	RES IN NETWORKING TECH & SYS	08/01/2007	07/14/2009	Ahmed Kamal	IA	Iowa State University	Continuing grant	Joseph Lyles	09/30/2011	$330,699.00	Aditya Ramamoorthy	kamal@iastate.edu	1138 Pearson	AMES	IA	500112207	5152945225	CSE	7363	7363, 7388, 9178, 9218, 9251, HPCC	$0.00	Network survivability is an important requirement that must be provided by network operators. In general, survivability techniques attempt to achieve two objectives, namely increasing (a) the agility of detecting and recovering from failure and (b) resource efficiency. However, these two objectives are in most cases contradictory and are difficult to achieve simultaneously. This is mainly because agility requires the use of expensive pre-provisioned protection circuits, which cannot be used by working connections.<br/><br/>In this project, network coding will be used to provide protection as a means of achieving survivable network operation that satisfies the above two objectives. In particular, pre-provisioned protection circuits will be shared by multiple connections where all such connections transmit their signals simultaneously and on the shared circuits. Network coding, where signals are combined before transmission, avoids the contention and collision between the signals, while simultaneously providing backup copies of the signals such that if failures take place, the signals can be easily and instantaneously extracted from the combined signals. The purpose of this project is to establish the theory and techniques for using network coding to support survivable network operation through protection. After rigorously formulating the problem of network survivability under network coding, a theory for network protection using network coding under single link failures will be introduced. The theory will then be extended to also handle the cases of multiple link and/or node failures. Stronger results for specific types of network connections will be developed. The theory will then be applied to develop implementation strategies for network coding-based protection for wireline and wireless networks, using different protocols at different layers.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this project is that it will provide the theoretical bases for the use of network coding to support protection in an agile, and resource efficient way, and will also introduce implementation methods for network coding-based protection. <br/><br/>The broader impact of this research is that it will provide an overarching approach for network coding-based survivability, which will extend and apply to several networking environments. The PIs expect that the developed techniques will be considered by network equipment manufacturers for adoption in their equipment and by the network operators for use in their networks, as this approach will provide cost efficiency, agility and flexibility. The project will also train graduate students in a new area of research, and in exploring novel applications of the new technique of network coding.

This configuration of shear and stratification is common in strongly time-dependent flows in the coastal ocean including estuarine inflows and outflows, separating flows around headlands and islands, and merging flows in morphologically complex regions such as tidal inlets. The resulting buoyancy-driven flow results in tilting and intense stretching of the shear-flow vortices and ultimately a breakdown of the flow leading to intense vertical mixing. Horizontal stratification in the presence of horizontal shear has the potential to strongly enhance mixing, despite the fact that the gravity-driven flow by itself increases the vertical stratification. The research into the dynamics and consequences of this process will involve both high-resolution non-hydrostatic numerical modeling and comprehensive laboratory experiments utilizing particle image velocimetry and laser-induced fluorescence. Scaling arguments for this highly nonlinear evolution have been developed and will guide the investigation. It is expected that the results will inform future parameterizations of mixing processes that are crucial in coastal ocean circulation models. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts <br/>Coastal mixing processes are important for pollutant transport and dilution, biogeochemical cycles of nutrients and carbon in the productive coastal zone, and the transport of marine larvae and plankton. The results of this study will yield understanding that should lead to improved parameterizations for mixing that can be incorporated into estuarine water quality, coastal ocean circulation, and ecological models. The PIs are both active in their respective academic programs (MIT/WHOI Joint Program and UNC Marine Science) and the results of this research will quickly reach the classroom. The grant will also provide important early career support for undergraduate and graduate students will be incorporated into aspects of the research through the WHOI Summer Student Fellowship Program and the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics (GFD) Summer Program at WHOI. The grant will support the continued operation of the WHOI GFD Laboratory, which has hosted over 100 visiting students and scientists over the last 30 years to undertake a variety of experiments spanning physical oceanography, atmospheric dynamics, fluid dynamics, and geological processes.

AIP retains much of the elegance and simplicity of <br/>IP, but is far better equipped to thwart malicious adversaries. To <br/>provide this protection, AIP incorporates three kinds of <br/>accountability: source accountability, control-plane accountability, <br/>and dataplane accountability. Together, these three forms of <br/>accountability ensure that any host, router, and autonomous network <br/>can identify misbehaving components.<br/><br/>Operationally, this results in: an Internet in which any spoofing or <br/>forgery of source addresses is detectable (from source <br/>accountability); a partial defense against flooding attacks from <br/>compromised hosts (also from source accountability); an Internet <br/>where route hijacking and other security compromises to inter-domain <br/>routing are impossible (from control-plane accountability); and the <br/>ability for end hosts and operators to pinpoint locations where <br/>packets are being lost or excessively delayed even when the problems <br/>are in other networks (from data-plane accountability).<br/><br/>The cornerstone of AIP is its use of a self-certifying address <br/>format. All AIP addresses are of the form AD:EID, where AD is the <br/>identifier for the autonomous domain that the host belongs to, and <br/>EID is a globally unique host identifier. Both address components are <br/>derived from public keys held by the domain and host, respectively, <br/>allowing other entities to verify the authenticity and provenance of <br/>packets and messages. AIP's self-certifying addressing allows simple <br/>protocols to realize the above benefits.

This will be enabled by combining multiple unique dispersive properties of PCs in a single structure. The optimal dispersion engineering will allow for the development of novel microspectrometers and PC interferometers with excellent performance for sensing, despite having dimensions in the order of only a few hundred microns. The complete integrated spectrometer module is realized by optimal integration of these different functionalities (superprism-based spectrometers and PC interferometers) in a single substrate through the addition of optimal mode converters (or matching stages). Such heterostructure PCs will offer the best solution to the everincreasing demand for integrated chip-scale spectroscopy, especially for sensing applications. The expected performance improvement (accuracy in spectral feature detection, size of the structure, etc.) over existing implementations of the PC spectrometers will be 1-2 orders of magnitude. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: While the focus in this proposal is the development of ultra-compact on-chip spectrometers, the results of the two major tasks proposed here will be beneficial for other applications as well. For example, the use of the second PC band can dramatically improve the performance of the PC wavelength demultiplexers for which the findings of this research can be used with some modifications during optimization. Another example is the use of PC interferometers directly for sensing applications in which the presence of the analyte of interest changes the output spatial-spectral pattern, which can be measured and used for the estimation of the properties of the analyte. The photonic crystal structures as defined in this proposal have the prospect of creating a revolution in on-chip optical sensing systems. The concept of dispersion engineering in PCs can be extended to three-dimensional (3D) PC structures for the development of compact devices for free-space optics applications.

A bio-mimetic self-assembly approach is taken to use DNA as programmable construction building block to engineer and develop novel nanostructured materials. The goals of this international collaboration are aimed at: 1) Mimicking nature's strong microtubule structure to design spiral DNA nanotubes that will have improved mechanical properties; 2) Developing surface alignment methods to assemble DNA nanotubes into two-dimensional networks, thereby bridging the bottom-up self-assembly with top-down lithographic approaches together; 3) Achieving improved DNA templated nanowire formation based on stronger mechanic properties of the DNA nanotubes and their alignment on surface. This project involves extensive collaboration between Arizona State University (Dr. Yan) in US and Dresden University of Technology (Dr. Mertig) in Germany.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of the project lies in that DNA nanotube templated nanowire or nanoparticle assembly provides unprecedented opportunities to explore electronics/magnetics/optical properties with novel annular geometries in nanoscale domains. The bio-inspired self-assembly may prove useful in creating computer chips with smaller feature sizes. The project has broader impact by: 1) Integrating the research results into the material research curriculum developments at both universities. Examples of such courses include Molecular Bioengineering at Dresden and Nanobiotechnology at ASU; 2) Teaching Bio-mimetic Self-assembly topics to high school students through a high school outreach program; 3) Disseminating cutting-edge material research knowledge to a wider audience of minority communities and encourage underrepresented students to pursue careers in science.<br/><br/>This award is co-funded with the Office of International Science and Engineering.

However, there is an urgent need to incorporate reliability requirements to these frameworks, in view of the ever-increasing transient fault rates linked to scaled technology sizes and reduced design margins. This is particularly important for safety-critical real-time embedded systems. Recent reports indicating that the problem is exacerbated by the widely-popular energy management technique, dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS), which has an alarmingly negative effect on system reliability because of increased transient fault rates associated with operation at low supply voltages.<br/><br/>This project undertakes a comprehensive study of the interplay between energy management and transient fault recovery in real-time embedded systems. First, a generalized transient fault model for DVFS-enabled systems is being developed that considers the effects of radiation, temperature and electromagnetic interference. Second, focusing on operating-system-level algorithms and tools, the project is developing an integrated, reliability-aware power management framework for different types of embedded and real-time systems. The framework enables a trade-off analysis for energy savings and aggregate reliability to be carried out. Adaptive schemes that dynamically improve the system performance by monitoring system's execution at run-time are also investigated. The project is expected to have a substantial technological impact as energy-efficiency and reliability are known to be fundamental requirements for next generation real-time and embedded systems.

During the 1980s and 1990s, renewed collecting efforts on several of the islands revealed more evidence, and now it is clear that primates, like many other vertebrates, have had a long evolutionary history on Cuba, Jamaica and Hispaniola. This project will focus on the dental morphology and diet of the three named primates (Antillothrix bernensis, Paralouatta varonai, and Xenothrix mcgregori), for which there is dental evidence, and one unnamed Haitian specimen, which represents a new species. Along with a large comparative sample of living New World monkeys and a few fossil forms, the dental morphology of the Antillean primates will be evaluated functionally for dietary information. To accomplish this, all dentitions will first be laser scanned to create three-dimensional models, which will then be analyzed using a variety of statistical techniques, including multivariate analysis and recently developed geometric morphometric methods designed to exploit our new capacity to map surface anatomy three-dimensionally. In addition, the new Haitian species will be systematically described and compared to existing Antillean primates to ascertain its phylogenetic position, dietary adaptation, and ecological role in the Caribbean community. <br/>This project has intellectual merit in adding knowledge concerning the taxonomic and adaptive diversity of an understudied group of primates to an area of paleoanthropological interest that has burgeoned during the past two decades and is ready for new paleobiological syntheses based on an impressive new accumulation of fossil evidence stretching from Argentina to Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia and the Caribbean. <br/>This project will also be one of the first to employ a new suite of methods including high resolution laser scanning for measurement, computer graphics methods for visualization, and three-dimensional geometric morphometric techniques for the analysis of primate dentitions, for both functional and taxonomic questions. <br/>This study has broader impacts, too. It will be one of the first to employ statistically robust samples of virtual specimens in anthropology, thus laying the groundwork for disseminating research quality digital objects for scientific and educational purposes. All of the laser scans used in this study will be made available immediately to the general public via the New York Consortium in Evolutionary Primatology (NYCEP) website once the study is completed.

As the first step, an inherently safe stationary wearable arm system will be designed and constructed with a neuro-muscular system identification technique to extract the human adaptation parameters in real time. The intellectual merit of the proposed activity is that, using this virtual robotic environment, fundamental scientific questions relating to human perceptual and neural interactions between the virtual and actual movements will be investigated. With these intellectual contributions, this environment will immediately lead to rehabilitating patients with motor impairments, even for those who are not strong enough to execute task-level movements on their own, by steering them beyond what they had previously thought they were capable of doing. The educational goals are to create interdisciplinary educational environment, to increase the number of women in engineering and computer science, and to increase the interaction between motor-impaired students and engineering students. The proposed research and educational approach will have a significant and broader impact not only in the scientific and educational communities but also the lives of disabled people who are not currently able to independently execute everyday tasks.<br/><br/>This project was originally funded as a CAREER award, and was converted to a Presidential Early Career Award for Engineers and Scientists (PECASE) award in September 2004.

Drennan, doctoral candidate Scott Palumbo will carry out surface collections and test excavations at the site of Barriles and several smaller sites in the Volcan Baru region in the mountains of western Panama, in order to evaluate the importance of craft production and exchange in the emergence and development of social inequality between 350 B.C. and A.D. 1520. Previous researchers have argued that emerging elites in this region established control over the production of ground stone tools necessary to forest clearance and wood working tools and thereby made an ever larger population dependent upon them. Others have argued that control over the production of luxury items was another way by which elites gained prestige and influence.<br/><br/>Previous research in the Volcan Baru region has already shown that archaeological evidence for the production of ground stone axes and related tools is present at several large communities. Mr. Palumbo will collect more detailed evidence to evaluate whether this production was controlled by or otherwise connected to emerging social elites at these centers. His larger samples of artifacts from more controlled contexts will also reveal whether there was specialized production of other sorts of utilitarian items and/or of luxury or symbolic items. Smaller settlements will also be included in his sample, making it possible to assess whether such specialized production was absent there. Such a result would lead to the conclusion that these subsidiary places were dependent upon larger centers of production for such goods. Whether, and when, these kinds of patterns emerged during the two millennia of social change to be studied will be the key to understanding how important was the role of control over specialized economic production in the increasingly hierarchical social organization of the region. The artifact samples Mr. Palumbo's analysis will be based on will be recovered from thousands of tiny excavation units widely distributed through the residential sections of several settlements, making possible comprehensive statements about the organization of production and its relationship to social ranking. Ultimately, the results of this research will be used to compare the Volcan Baru region to other regions in the world to understand better how social inequality developed and persisted in the past.<br/><br/>This research will also have broader impacts beyond its scientific findings. It will provide essential training for the doctoral candidate, as well as for Panamanian, Costa Rican, Colombian and North American students who will be engaged in several aspects of the field and laboratory work. In this way, the project will also strengthen international scientific collaboration. Public appreciation of the nature and relevance of archaeological research, as well as the importance of protecting the archaeological record, will be enhanced though community outreach to local schools and universities. Results will be presented in the towns of Volcan and Cerro Punta, Chiriqui Province, to inform local residents about the findings, and thus about the cultural heritage of their region.

Fraser at the University of Virginia to prepare and study light emitting metal complexes. Polymeric boron complexes, such as multi-emissive difluoroboron dibenzoylmethane polylactide, serve as the focus of the study. Effects of ligand modifications, polymer composition and molecular weight, solvent, and temperature on the intense fluorescence and the unusual oxygen sensitive, room temperature phosphorescence will be investigated in detail. The boron biomaterials also possess two-photon absorption capabilities and are solvatochromic, serving as sensitive probes of the local medium. These features are important for emission color tuning and for biological imaging and oxygen sensing. Toward these ends, nanoparticle fabrication, emission, oxygen sensitivity, and degradation will also be investigated in aqueous suspensions. <br/><br/>This research is interdisciplinary and collaborative. Graduate students interact with numerous scientists and engineers, industry, and the UVA Patent Foundation to address scientific questions and to pursue materials applications. This project presents opportunities to share the excitement of science with broader audiences through the Designing Matter writing projec and a new advanced course at the University of Virginia on metals in medicine and the environment.
0731552	Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant: Fracture Patterns and Interpersonal Violence in the Moche of Northern Coastal Peru	BCS	ARCHAEOLOGY	08/01/2007	08/05/2007	John Verano	LA	Tulane University	Standard Grant	John E. Yellen	07/31/2008	$12,746.00		verano@mailhost.tcs.tulane.edu	6823 ST CHARLES AVENUE	NEW ORLEANS	LA	701185698	5048654000	SBE	1391	1391, 9150, 9179, SMET	$0.00	The Moche culture, which flourished on the North Coast of Peru in the early part of the first millennium AD, has been the focus of archaeological investigation for decades. However, questions still linger regarding the nature of Moche political structure and warfare. Early researchers believed the Moche represented the first state-level culture in Andean South America. More recently, there has been a shift in thinking, with many researchers now believing the Moche consisted of two or more polities with differing levels of localized autonomy. Moche warfare has been similarly contested, with ideas about the function and frequency of armed conflict shaping and being shaped by beliefs about political structure. Therefore, a clarification of one of these two features of Andean society would help to resolve questions about the other.<br/><br/>To that end, this study will provide crucial evidence about Moche warfare from a source that has, so far, been underutilized: the remains of the Moche people themselves. Under the supervision of Dr. John Verano, Sara Phillips will analyze patterns in bone fractures in skeletal remains from numerous Moche sites to determine the frequency and distribution of warfare in this culture. Fracture pattern analysis provides such insight in two ways. First, a comparison of the frequency of fracture in different skeletal elements will show whether the Moche people were commonly involved in acts of interpersonal violence or if the majority of their fractures were the result of accidents. This is possible because certain fractures are indicative of interpersonal violence and others of occupational or other mishaps. Secondly, comparing the fracture pattern between individuals--those of different age, sex, and status--will show the type of individuals most likely to have experience with interpersonal violence. This comparison can be done with groups from different time periods and different Moche sites, as well as between the Moche samples as a whole and data collected from other archaeological cultures. Together, these analyses will draw a picture of Moche warfare which can be compared to the expectations derived from theories about Moche political structure to see if a military state or cooperating polities characterized the Moche.<br/><br/>The greater understanding of Moche warfare that will be provided by the proposed study is integral to clarifying the picture of Moche political structure by indicating whether military conquest or peaceful cooperation characterized their society. In either case, whether state or federation, the Moche culture is the linchpin to understanding the complex societies that followed in the Andes and to understanding the overall development of complex social structure in the region. Also, as one of the few areas where state-level society originated independently, tracing increasing complexity in Andean society will provide greater insight into the mechanisms behind state formation in general. Therefore, it is important that all available sources of information about the nature of Moche warfare and government be studied. One such source, the evidence for warfare left in the bodies of the Moche people themselves, has not been fully utilized, something study will remedy.

Ross and Ran Zhang<br/><br/>Title: Doctoral Dissertation Research: This is My Right: Understanding Students Legal Consciousness through Due Process Protection in Chinese Universities<br/><br/>0719715<br/><br/>Abstract<br/> This study examines court documents, legal decisions, law and regulations relevant to students' due process rights, and survey and interview data from college students in four Chinese universities to explain the development of Chinese students' legal consciousness. The study will investigate what due process rights mean to Chinese students, how students' legal consciousness influences their legal and non-legal actions, and whether and to what extent this consciousness varies in relation to individual and institutional characteristics. The study's key proposition is that rights consciousness entails not only knowledge of legal rules, but also an awareness of the procedural and substantive values behind such rules and the capability to make situated rightful deliberation based on these rules and values. This proposition implies that an individual's claim of due process rights can be justified from three perspectives: provisions in statutes and regulations; internal pressure within the legal system to bring educational and other key sector laws into alignment; and the call of justice or broader legislative intent to protect individuals' rights and interests. <br/> Chinese students' rights are a neglected area of research in both education and law. This study will advance the two investigators' early work on students' rights in China, which represent the first set of inquiry in this area. This project will also fill an important and glaring gap in the larger scholarship on rights, citizenship, and resistance in China. Chinese intellectuals, home owners, and peasants have learned to leverage political opportunities within the state system to expand the boundaries of their rights. This study will add significantly to this literature by illuminating the future significance to Chinese society of the development of students' rights consciousness during a critical transition to adulthood. <br/> This study also has practical implications for the expanding boundary of students' rights in China. Students' legal consciousness is important not only as a concept worthy of scholarly analysis, but also in its generative power as a catalyst for galvanizing disadvantaged or less powerful social groups to stand up, claim their rights, and affect social change. This study provides a significant opportunity for documenting and examining the historical trajectory and current landscape of the development of students' due process rights in China. Furthermore, the multiple perspectives used in justifying claims to legal rights that are illuminated in this study may be of practical utility for Chinese students who are persistently contesting the boundary of individual freedom in both courtroom and classroom.

A primary objective of this project is to provide a<br/>venue in which researchers, especially those considered rising stars in the field, can describe<br/>their lines of inquiry and to then receive guidance and input about refining those ambitions. The<br/>other primary objective is to promote an innovative conference design in which a structured<br/>presentation format serves as an incubator for scholarly work. Underwriting by NSF is crucial<br/>because it will allow wider participation in this project than would otherwise be affordable.<br/>Products of the conference include an electronic proceedings that will be posted to the<br/>conference website (www.sciedxroads.org) as well as a book (under contract) documenting the<br/>scope and successes of the conference. In addition, the promising scholars attending will<br/>generate research papers to be disseminated and published for a wider audience. Ultimately, this<br/>project supports developments within science education research even as it advances a fresh<br/>vision for professional conferences. As a result, more school-based research will be conducted,<br/>more policy-shaping documents will be generated, and more emphasis will be made upon<br/>increasing the quality of science learning opportunities for all students.

Recent studies have indicated that some scientific problems that had been assumed to require a spatial visualization strategy, in fact are often solved by analytic strategies. Therefore, the PIs propose a three-phase project to characterize the use of cognitive strategies during spatial problem solving in both general and organic chemistry. They aim to identify the differential use of visuo-spatial strategies and the availability of analytical strategies for scientific problem solving by students and instructors, individuals with high and low spatial ability, and men and women. They will also develop and evaluate methods of training these strategies. In Phase I of the project they will conduct task and protocol analyses of student and instructor problem solving in the domain of chemistry and in spatial ability measures. In Phase II, they will collect data on students spatial abilities, gender, and educational background to identify the determinants of strategy use in visuo-spatial problem solving, both generally and in the chemistry domain. In Phase III, they will train chemistry teaching assistants to teach alternative strategies to students in their class discussion sections. They will examine the effects of strategy training on problem solving by students of different levels of spatial abilities by assessing their strategies before an after instruction.

This covalent yet reversible assembly strategy represents a novel paradigm in designing new molecular assemblies, providing a modular and predictable route to generate network and linear polymeric materials. The project utilizes trigonal planar boron compounds and polytrophic di-Lewis basic compounds (i.e. diols, diamines) in non-aqueous media, forming boronate linkages between building blocks. This approach is in contrast to the majority of molecular recognition literature on boronic acid/ester equilibria which focuses on the assembly of two molecular units. A series of functionalized covalent organic frameworks (COFs) will be synthesized as well as other novel unsubstituted frameworks by varying the shape, size, valency and di-Lewis basic linkers of the building blocks. Studies to probe the stability, structure, porosity and gas uptake and storage of these new frameworks will be carried out. Additionally, a series of linear poly (boronate)s will be synthesized and their mechanical and electronic properties investigated. These polymers are expected to have physical properties analogous to both traditional covalent polymers and supramolecular polymers, taking the best from both worlds to create new hybrid materials. Furthermore, functional conjugated poly (boronate)s will be studied to decipher their properties and potential roles as emissive or possibly conducting materials.<br/><br/>With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports Professor John Lavigne of the University of South Carolina whose research will prepare boronate linked networks and linear polymers that will ultimately lead to the creation of new nano-scale materials for potential applications in the areas of separations, catalysis, storage, optical materials, and sensing. Dr. Lavigne and his students (both graduate and undergraduate) will be exposed to a wide range of topics including organic, materials, physical, and supramolecular chemistry. Students will receive training in a highly multidisciplinary environment to become better problem solvers not just on the microscale, but also on a more global scale. Furthermore, given the diverse nature of the project, students will need to interact with other researchers and work in groups, helping them develop communication skills and learn to work as part of a team. Support from this grant will allow students to continue the pursuit of their educational and professional goals while also supporting the development of community outreach and curriculum development for primarily non-scientist audiences.

There is an urgent need to integrate, index and model multimodal data across a large population in order to discover a more detailed understanding about process interaction in this very complex biological system. Current state-of-the-art computational and software technologies fall short in multimodality data integration and modeling, and integrated analysis of diverse neuroimaging datasets across human subjects. The overall aim of this proposal is to develop a novel, rigorous framework for integrated modeling and analysis of multimodality neuroimaging data based on Riemannian geometry, multivariate simplex splines, and statistical learning. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merits <br/>This interdisciplinary research team will design a fundamental framework for advanced and integrated analysis of brain imaging data. All research activities will address the following major themes and objectives: (1) To explore new theoretic tools based on Riemannian geometry of 3-manifolds for the development of a novel Canonical Volumetric Model (CVM) which provides volumetric mapping of individual brain to a solid unit sphere with accurate matching across subjects; (2) To design hierarchical spherical trivariate simplex splines for compact representation, integration, indexing and visualization of multimodality heterogeneous imaging data with high efficiency and accuracy, which can further refine the intersubject registration through level-of-detail matching in a higher dimensional physical space based on the integration of the hierarchical spline volume with Lagrangian dynamics; (3) To design new statistical learning and mining methods to analyze simultaneously the variety of data across the broad range of spatial and temporal scales and human subjects in order to infer the dynamics of brain functions in neurological disease studies. <br/><br/>Broad Impacts <br/>This research will contribute to the data-intensive brain study by offering an accurate, robust, and innovative scientific approach for analytic integration, statistical modeling, and quantitative analysis of a variety of brain imaging data. The proposed computational framework has the potential to be applied across multiple areas of brain research as well as in clinical diagnosis. It is likely that this work will impact a large number of patients with neurological diseases and will provide a commonly accepted standard infrastructure for use by many other researchers. The PIs'' research endeavors will be tightly integrated with a complementary set of educational objectives, including: (1) the development of new strategies for truly multi-disciplinary science education; (2) the enhancement of the existing curricula; (3) the doctoral training of graduate researchers; (4) the implementation of mentoring activities for students from underrepresented groups.

At a recent workshop sponsored by the National Institute on Aging, leaders in the field of human aging called for more research on aging in nonhuman primates. How and when do primates become old? Increasingly it is known that long lifespans are not unique to humans, apes, or even monkeys. The smallest-bodied primates are cheirogaleids (mouse lemurs and their relatives) and studies in captivity show that mouse lemurs can live almost ten times longer than like-sized nonprimates such as mice or shrews. Therefore, because even the most primitive of extant primates are long-lived when compared to like-sized mammals in other orders, it is essential that such an analysis begin with our most distant cousins, lemurs. This is particularly important because in captivity, certain lemurs are known to develop Alzheimer's-like plaques and tangles in aged individuals. This project seeks answers to these questions through research focusing on two lemur species Microcebus rufus, the brown mouse lemur, and Propithecus edwardsi, Milne Edwards' sifaka, in their natural habitat in a single rain forest, Ranomafana National Park, eastern Madagascar. These are the smallest- and largest-bodied primates at this location. <br/>The project uses dental, hormonal, behavioral and experimental data to test a variety of hypotheses regarding the evolution of senescence. A new method of dental senescence analysis will be used to measure age in wild sifakas and mouse lemurs. Correlates of aging will be tested in both species by examining three somatic landmarks: muscle function, brain function, and dental function. Finally, reproductive landmarks and reproductive success will be examined in both young and old female lemurs. Taken together, these data will provide insights into the timing of reproductive and somatic senescence in distant relatives of humans, thereby indicating aspects of human aging that may have deep evolutionary roots.<br/>This project will engage people of a variety of backgrounds and experience, including undergraduates and graduate students from several countries (including the USA, Finland, Germany, Argentina, and Madagascar). The research team will work closely with Madagascar's National Park Service staff. The Centre ValBio at which this study will be based employs 65 local Malagasy people as biodiversity field technicians. In addition to contributing to aging research, this work will have conservation implications that can be used to inform management plans.

Based on recent research that surface fluxes of newly-ventilated water must be partitioned according to the water's residence time in the ocean interior in order to describe correctly how inventories of transient tracers evolve with time, ventilation rate is therefore a distribution and not, as had been thought sufficient until now, a single number representing a bulk flux. This fundamentally changes the estimation problem to a deconvolution for a ventilation-rate distribution that propagates known mixed-layer concentrations to measured interior values.<br/><br/>Oceanographers from Columbia University and University of California at Irvine propose to use CFC, tritium, and radiocarbon transient tracer data, together with gridded temperature, salinity, nutrient, and oxygen data, to estimate the ventilation-rate distributions of the ocean. The ventilation-rate distributions will systematically be estimated for a range of density classes whose outcrops cover most of the global ocean surface. A major part of the proposed work will be a rigorous quantification of the uncertainties due to errors in the data and due to the underdetermined nature of the deconvolutions.<br/><br/>Two deconvolution methods will be employed: A tested parametric approach and a novel application<br/>of the maximum-entropy method. The deconvolution of the ventilation-rate distribution will be constrained on decadal timescales by CFCs, tritium and bomb radiocarbon and by the background radiocarbon on longer timescales. Steady tracers will constrain the ventilation-rate distribution's spatial and seasonal dependence. The maximum-entropy inversions will use a state-of-the-art data-assimilation model to produce a prior guess for the ventilation-rate distribution. This model will also be used to generate realistic synthetic tracer data to quantify the systematic errors of both the parametric and the maximum-entropy deconvolutions. The research will provide a novel comprehensive picture of how the ocean communicates with the atmosphere on timescales of months to millennia and help reconcile disparate previous estimates of ventilation based on the incomplete bulk-flux picture.<br/><br/>The proposed research will provide the first global estimate of the ventilation-rate distribution for the current state of the ocean and a baseline estimate of its uncertainty so that future estimates of variability and climate change in ventilation can meaningfully be assessed. The proposed work will be synergistic with climate research on constraining the oceanic uptake of anthropogenic carbon. A MATLAB toolbox for performing generalized water-mass analysis using the maximum entropy method will be made available to the community. In addition to the primary scientific contributions, the proposed work will provide funding to support the career development of a postdoctoral scholar, and education and training for graduate students in ocean transport diagnostics, data analysis techniques, ocean modeling, and in analyzing the ocean's role in the climate system.

By contrast, the present-day Internet architecture concerns itself primarily with issues of ``how'' and ``where''-- what are the protocols by which a data item is delivered and to which topological endpoints.  This inherent dissonance of purpose makes Internet security a bolt-on affair---with abstract access control policies pushed off to be implemented by particular applications or mapped onto the poor approximations provided by network-level abstractions (e.g., network firewalls).  Moreover, these imperfect mechanisms are themselves attacked with impunity since today's Internet architecture provides a functional anonymity that insulates attackers from any meaningful liability.<br/><br/>This project is developing two key architectural capabilities--host attribution (which physical machine sent a packet) and data provenance (what is the ``origin'' of the data contained within a packet)--to enable the direct expression of a wide-range of security policies. Moreover, these properties are being implemented in a fashion that mandates their use (in a strong sense) by the network, but manages to preserve end-user privacy.  The PIs are focusing on two key applications in this work: forensic trace-back and attribution for the purpose of attack deterrence, and defensive data-exfiltration to place precise controls over what kinds of data may move across a network.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: This research is developing key architectural components to improve the level of security and assurance available to network services.  In addition, the PIs are initiating a dialogue among both researchers and network operators about critical policy aspects of network security.  In particular, information about the sources of both normal and attack traffic that must be safeguarded according to some policy.

Coppedge and Carlos Gervasoni<br/><br/>Title: Doctoral Dissertation Research in Political Science: Measuring and Explaining Differences in Subnational Democracy in the Argentine Provinces<br/><br/>0719658<br/><br/>Abstract<br/><br/>What are the causes of widely different levels of democracy in the subnational units of national-level federal democracies? From Argentina to Brazil to India, democratic and less democratic states/provinces coexist side by side. Drawing on fiscal and rentier theories of democracy, I hypothesize that, by redistributing tax revenues disproportionally in favor of poorer or less populated subnational units, federal governments provide local incumbents in these districts with hefty rents that often are used to stifle democracy. Rents also make incumbents fiscally independent from, and consequently less accountable to, their constituencies. I assess this hypothesis using evidence from Argentina, a case of this type of politically regressive fiscal federalism. The dependent variable, subnational democracy, will be measured through a survey of experts on the politics of each of the 24 Argentine provinces. The proposed survey draws on the tradition of national-level indices that code countries on the basis of expert assessments and secondary sources, extends it for the first time to subnational units, and improves on it by using multiple coders and by adopting a thick and multidimensional conceptualization of democracy. The experts to be interviewed are local, politically independent scholars and journalists. Each item in the questionnaire will be assessed by three to five experts per province. The results will be used to construct an index of democracy for each province. The explanatory power of the fiscal/rentier hypothesis and of alternative hypotheses will be assessed through a mixed-methods strategy, combining statistical analysis with qualitative case-studies. Regression analysis will estimate the relative strength of each explanatory factor and the goodness-of-fit of the theoretical model. This quantitative evidence will be used to select four qualitative case studies, which will permit to trace the causal processes at work and to refine the original theoretical model. Four innovations are contributed to the key but neglected subnational dimension of democracy: 1) the application of fiscal/rentier theories to subnational units, 2) the extension of the concept of rents from natural resources to fiscal federalism revenues, 3) the first thick measurement of democracy in all the subnational units of any country, and 4) an original operationalization through a survey of experts that improves on national-level indices. These innovations are generalizable to other federal democracies and to other policy-driven rentier situations. The broader impacts of this research include: 1) significant public policy implications, as the findings would point the way toward the design of economically and politically progressive institutions of fiscal federalism, 2) the fostering of partnership between scholars in the US and Argentina, and 3) the contribution to the discipline of a novel operationalization strategy, a new dataset, and hopefully original and correct substantive conclusions, all of which will be disseminated through publications and a web site. More generally, this research is expected to bring attention to and help redress less-than-democratic subnational situations in young federal democracies.

However, evolutionary trees for different genes may lead to different results.  An alternative approach is to study the evolutionary history of whole genomes rather than individual genes, based on comparison of the order of homologous genes (or segments) between genomes.  This approach is known as genome rearrangements.  Genome rearrangements may be used to study the evolutionary process that led from unknown ancestral genomes to present day genomes, and to study the possible architectures of the ancestral genomes.  This project will use combinatorial techniques to study genome rearrangements.  The breakpoint graph is a combinatorial graph developed to compare gene orders in two different genomes.  There are well-developed techniques for studying genome rearrangements between two genomes based on the cycle structure of the breakpoint graph.  Although a generalization of the definition of breakpoint graphs to multiple genomes is straightforward, methods to analyze this graph do not so easily generalize.  Most studies of multiple genomes that use breakpoint graphs do two genomes at a time with ordinary breakpoint graphs, and combine the pairwise results.  This project will develop ways to use the multiple genome breakpoint graph more effectively.  There are several related applications: the construction of phylogenetic trees based on genome rearrangements; the study of potential ancestral gene orders; and the study of breakpoint reuse, which is the apparent or actual multiple use of a breakpoint region in a series of genome rearrangements.  Another mathematical construct used to represent different gene orders is permutations.  This project will also generalize classical work on permutation enumeration to the context of genome rearrangements with multiple genomes and multiple chromosomes.<br/><br/>Chromosomal evolution has long been of interest to biologists, and has recently caught the interest of mathematicians and computer scientists.  This interest has been greatly accelerated by the Human Genome Project and similar projects to sequence the genomes of other species.  These projects are national priorities, largely funded in the U.S. by the National Human Genome Research Institute and the Department of Energy.  Sequences or maps of different genomes are compared to find the corresponding genes and other features.  Many studies are focused on variations of the sequences within corresponding genes.  However, it is also of interest that the corresponding genes have usually moved to different chromosomes, moved into a different order within the same chromosome, or have been duplicated or deleted.  Additionally, chromosomes may be broken into two or fused together into one.  These phenomena are known as genome rearrangements, and the mathematical techniques and computer algorithms for studying complicated genome rearrangements have largely been developed only since the 1990s.  This project is focused on the use of particular mathematical techniques to study genome rearrangements and evolutionary trees.

In turn, this could provide an unprecedented opportunity for predicting and preventing future ecological problems by managing the ecology and health of our planet. Data mining and knowledge discovery techniques can aid this effort by discovering patterns that capture complex interactions among ocean temperature, air pressure, surface meteorology, and terrestrial carbon flux. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit<br/>The goals of this work are twofold: 1) to better understand global scale patterns in biosphere processes, particularly patterns in the global carbon cycle and climate system. More specifically, the proposed data mining research is driven by the need to address the following two challenges: (i) understanding how ocean, atmosphere and land processes are coupled and (ii) detecting and predicting ecosystem disturbances such as fires, floods, and hurricanes. 2) to support innovative Computer Science (CS) research in data mining. In particular, the spatio-temporal nature of Earth Science data means that standard CS data mining techniques often cannot be directly applied. As an example, in Earth Science research, a key step is the selection of the locations and time periods that are to be used to investigate possible relationships between two Earth Science phenomena, e.g., El Nino and milder winters in the Midwestern United States. Currently, this selection is based on domain knowledge, but automating this process would be very beneficial. The proposed work will develop new data mining techniques that address the high dimensionality, large size, and spatio-temporal nature of the data. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: New algorithms and techniques for the analysis of large spatio-temporal data sets developed in this project will be made available to other researchers within the Earth Science community. To a large extent, this project will encapsulate these algorithms within easy to use visual tools so that users will be able to more easily extract useful knowledge from Earth Science data sets. Although the focus will be on Earth Science data, the data mining techniques that are developed will be applicable to a wide variety of other fields that have data collected over time on a spatial grid. To give a specific example, spatio-temporal clustering has been used to track cyclones and animal migrations, and to model mobile phone users and neuronal activities in the brain, and the new spatio-temporal clustering techniques could also prove useful for these applications.

Teleoperative robotic systems and virtual environment simulations can make it easier to learn and perform surgery. With current technology, however, robotic surgery feels different from open surgery, which is quite different from minimally invasive surgery, and simulated procedures often fail to behave realistically like any of these.<br/><br/>Two of the most difficult aspects of minimally invasive techniques are limited haptic feedback and working dexterously under the kinematic constraints of the instruments. The most time-consuming portions of surgical procedures are typically dissection, which is hampered by poor haptics, and repair by suturing, which is made challenging by limited dexterity. These two skills will be studied in parallel thrusts. In each thrust, the skill will be modeled from experimental data. The models will be tested in simulation and robotic testbeds, then used to optimize the design of teleoperative surgical systems and virtual training environments.<br/><br/>This research is expected to have significant impact on the technology and teaching of minimally invasive surgery, allowing wider usage of beneficial techniques while improving medical outcomes and reducing errors.

They have already become an integral component of safety critical systems involving aviation, military, telecommunications, and process control applications. Interest in embedded systems is growing further due to the expectation that they will become a key component of many commonplace consumer appliances. Consumers will expect levels of reliability and predictability associated with the very best brands of cars, televisions, and refrigerators. Glitches, crashes, and general erratic behavior of the sort seen with prior generations of consumer PC software products will be unacceptable for these embedded applications. It thus becomes crucial that these embedded software systems satisfy high levels of correctness criteria, well above those of today's large software systems, which are often highly error-prone. This project will engage in research and development of a novel methodology for the systematic development of embedded systems, starting at a high-level property-based specification of system requirements and proceeding in a seamless and rigorous manner towards a running code. Central to the proposed design flow is the utilization of powerful new effective methods for the automatic synthesis of running code from behavioral (i.e., temporal) specifications. This technology will be used in two places: first, in order to determine whether a given property-based specification is realizable. Then, selected modules of the design, whose performance is not critical, will be generated by automatic synthesis. Automatic synthesis can also be used for rapid prototyping of larger portions of the design.<br/>In view of this master plan, the following main research activities are pursued:<br/>(1) development of a formal property-based language for specifying requirements, including behavioral, temporal, and structural constraints; supported by effective algorithms for the analysis of large specifications for consistency and realizability; development of a methodology for the automatic synthesis of an executable specification from the requirements specification language, to be used both for checking the realizability of large specifications, and the automatic construction of selected modules of the design; and (3) development of methods for the verification of the intermediate representations of the systems against requirements, using the techniques of translation validation. The property-based development approach has been recently applied successfully to the derivation of hardware designs. In view of this success, the application to the systematic construction of embedded systems is highly promising. This research pursues the generalization of the specification language to include real-time elements and continuous signals, and extends the synthesis approach to accommodate real-time and hybrid systems. With these capabilities, this project is expected to enable systematic co-design of software/hardware for the construction of embedded systems.

The Arabian Sea OMZ is one of the most intense such zones in the world ocean with near-total depletion of oxygen in the eastern-central Arabian Sea at a depth from 100-1000 m. Remarkably, the zone is shifted well to the east of the most productive regions of which are located in the western basin. <br/><br/>In this project, scientists from the University of Hawaii and the University of Maryland will collaborate with international partners from India and Japan in order to understand the processes that determine the strength and location of the Arabian Sea OMZ. Their working hypothesis is that physical, and not biological, processes shift this zone to the eastern basin through eddy processes. A hierarchy of physical models will be utilized for this study, each will be coupled to a biological model (NPZD) with an oxygen package. <br/><br/>The research aims to understand basic biophysical processes of the Arabian Sea oxygen minimum zone and the results should be applicable to other such regions in the world's oceans. Because of its intensity, understanding the dynamics of the Arabian Sea OMZ is of global importance. Because of its reducing conditions, the zone impacts the global nitrogen inventory and hence the degree of nitrogen limitation and carbon export. In addition, through the production of N2O, the zone also influences greenhouse gas accumulation in the atmosphere. Finally, the zone is known to have varied considerably on geological time scales which suggests that it may be affected by modern climate change.<br/><br/>The research also contributes to international programs including the development of the CLIVAR/GOOS Indian Ocean observing system and Integrated Marine Biology and Ecosystem Research (IMBER).

These surveys can identify all of the most massive clusters in the Universe, which will then be mined for clues to dark energy. However, accurate conclusions require understanding the astrophysics that limits systematic uncertainties. This is a computational project to improve understanding of clusters as multi-component, dynamically active systems. State-of-the-art simulations with a range of astrophysical treatments will characterize how the intrinsic, visible content of clusters relates to total mass and epoch. Studying multiple characteristics simultaneously will provide the first estimates of covariance between important, independent measures, such as X-ray temperature and luminosity, optical richness, and total gas thermal energy. Mock sky maps will be used to test and improve cluster detection methods. The studies will be of general use for all cluster surveys, and will include measuring the statistical form of property covariance, understanding the causes and magnitudes of projected source confusion, and testing the effects of merger-driven transients.<br/><br/>This project will train students in analysis involving data-intensive, high performance computing. The lead researcher continues to be active in organizing workshops and conferences, especially those that emphasize young researchers in the field, and intends a spring 2009 workshop to bring together observers, computational modelers and theorists to develop a consensus view of clusters as an astrophysical population, paving the way for dark energy studies.

The researcher will investigate how women in the southwestern United States experience menopause, and how competing information about the risks related to menopause circulating in science, the media, and the popular press influences women's menopause management strategies. To generate data for this study, the researcher will use multiple ethnographic methods including interviews and focus groups with perimenopausal women, interviews with healthcare providers, participant observation at menopause-related educational and information sessions, and careful monitoring of the representations of menopause in science, media, and popular press. Data will be analyzed using qualitative open-coding and re-coding techniques to identify themes and thematic patterns. <br/><br/>By focusing on how notions of risk operate not on the level of grand theory, but as a part of everyday experience, this research contributes to the understanding of how people negotiate information and risk discourses in their daily lives, the way these discourses are inscribed on bodies, and the way bodily practices are shaped in response. From an applied perspective, this study provides a model based on an exemplar case study for investigating patient decision-making in a pluralistic healthcare environment where the public is increasingly exposed to ambiguous or contradictory information about the risks and benefits of mainstream and alternative therapies. The research also will contribute to the education of a graduate student.

Recent studies<br/>have indicated that some scientific problems that had been assumed to require a spatial<br/>visualization strategy, in fact are often solved by analytic strategies. Therefore, the PIs<br/>propose a three-phase project to characterize the use of cognitive strategies during<br/>spatial problem solving in both general and organic chemistry. They aim to identify the<br/>differential use of visuo-spatial strategies and the availability of analytical strategies for<br/>scientific problem solving by students and instructors, individuals with high and low<br/>spatial ability, and men and women. They will also develop and evaluate methods of<br/>training these strategies. In Phase I of the project they will conduct task and protocol<br/>analyses of student and instructor problem solving in the domain of chemistry and in<br/>spatial ability measures. In Phase II, they will collect data on students spatial abilities,<br/>gender, and educational background to identify the determinants of strategy use in<br/>visuo-spatial problem solving, both generally and in the chemistry domain. In Phase III,<br/>they will train chemistry teaching assistants to teach alternative strategies to students in<br/>their class discussion sections. They will examine the effects of strategy training on<br/>problem solving by students of different levels of spatial abilities by assessing their<br/>strategies before an after instruction.

Reich of the University of Wisconsin whose research goal is a mechanism understanding of important organometallic reactions. The study involves main group organometallic compounds that are widely used for forming carbon-carbon bonds. They are also useful for forming carbon-X bonds and are, therefore, common precusors to other organometallic reagents (B, Zn, Ti, Al, Cu, Ce, Sn, Si, P, S, Se and Te) with important uses in synthetic chemistry. A newly developed rapid injection NMR apparatus will be used to study a number of aspects of organolithium chemistry for which current knowledge is very limited: the reactivity of individual aggregates of lithium reagents, the reactivity of carbonyl compounds, and even individual conformations of carbonyl compounds too reactive to be studied by laboratory time scale experiments (aldehydes, ketones, esters, amides). The proposed spectroscopic and reactivity studies of solvation and chelation together with product selectivity and rate studies will result in a better understanding of these phenomena, better predictability of the chemical reactions of organolithium reagents, and expansion of the applications of lithium reagents.<br/><br/>With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports Professor Hans J. Reich of the University of Wisconsin whose research will have an impact in the area of synthetic organic chemistry by providing better insight into the behavior of important reactive species. The research will contribute to scientific manpower by providing a broad training in physical organic chemistry, organometallic chemistry, spectroscopy and organic synthesis for graduate and undergraduate students. Two computer programs of general utility for the analysis and interpretation of NMR data and the efficient presentation of chemical information have been written to support this research, and will continue to be enhanced. These programs have been made freely available to the chemical community on the web. Several web sites containing valuable information related to organic and organometallic chemistry in an easily accessible form have been created, and these will continue to be expanded and enhanced in the course of this project.

Such uses often involve techniques and applications that are outside the realm of traditional radio spectrum applications, therefore the Committee is useful to help guide the FCC and other regulatory bodies toward the adoption of spectrum rules and policies that will not create unnecessary interference to radio astronomy, meteorology, remote sensing, oceanography, and other scientific uses of the spectrum. Because of the multi-disciplinary aspect of the Committee's goals, it is supported by both the National Science Foundation and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The full Committee, comprised of 15 members, meets approximately twice per year, and between meetings it works on crafting comments and other written documents in response to various regulatory proceedings. The Committee also sends representatives to appropriate meetings of scientific (e.g., the International Union of Radio Scientists) and policy-setting bodies (e.g., the International Telecommunication Union) to help publicize their positions. The Committee has been in existence for many years, and the current award will continue National Science Foundation support through fiscal year 2010.

The focus is on thin layers, a wide-spread oceanic phenomenon that may serve as an organizing element of plankton patchiness. The objective is to quantify copepod threshold responses to key properties of thin layers. The successful creation of a controlled well-defined thin layer in a laboratory setting enables a quantitative comparison of kinematic patterns of plankton in response to fine-scale biological-chemical-physical features. The specially-designed apparatus creates flow gradients at naturally-occurring strain rate, density gradient, and phytoplankton exudate concentration levels, thus mimicking the essential properties of this fine-scale oceanic feature. A unique feature of the proposed treatments is that by presenting cues separately, the dominant cue for aggregation and interactions among cues can be assessed. The proposed experimental design isolates the effect of 1. individual cues, combined cues, and combined cues that are spatially separated, 2. zooplankton size, and 3. palatable vs. toxic phytoplankton species in the thin layer. The project will also evaluate the role of copepod satiation in the threshold sensitivity of plankton to thin layer cues. The ability to observe and<br/>quantify zooplankton behavior within a well-controlled environment enables a direct link between behavior and structure. Current approaches to this problem are limited because of a technological inability to sample in the ocean at the necessary scales. To scale up from the laboratory studies to in situ behavior, the laboratory data on zooplankton behavioral responses to oceanic structure will be examined for zooplankton populations using an individual-based model. The mathematical model parameterized with measured current field data will be used to reproduce the concurrent observations (in collaboration with Tim Cowles, Mark Benfield, Carin Ashjian, and Malinda Sutor) of zooplankton associated with physical-chemical oceanic features can be predicted using. Thus, fine-scale zooplankton behavior will be connected to their field distribution with respect to features in the ocean.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The biological and physical mechanisms underlying zooplankton behavioral responses are important to interpret and predict energy and material cycling and productivity of ocean ecosystems. The proposed research will be valuable to fisheries management by advancing our understanding of the impact of environmental change on the distribution and availability of prey items for managed living marine resources, such as juvenile salmon and other small pelagic fish. This research relies on an interdisciplinary collaboration between biology and fluid mechanics. The continued collaboration at Georgia Tech brings innovative tools to the oceanographic community and contributes to instrument development for in situ imaging. This proposal also represents a new collaboration between Gerogia Tech and NOAA Fisheries through the participation of Andrew Leising, who is a de facto Co-PI. The students involved in this project will experience a rich interdisciplinary research environment. This training will be further enhanced by on-going educational efforts, within existing NSF IGERT and REU programs in the area of aquatic chemical and hydromechanical signaling.

The goal of this research grant is to enable the deployment of service-capable and responsive wireless-based networks through real-time network diagnosis and dynamic adaptation. <br/><br/>Only through an integration of real-time measurement and analysis (localized, autonomous adaptation by network devices, and management though visualization and interactive analysis) can wireless networks achieve long-term utility and stability while also providing support for increasingly complex services. <br/><br/>The research in this project is divided into five areas: dynamic monitoring, which includes work to improve the accuracy of monitored data as well as the real-time capability to perform targeted high-fidelity monitoring; network health diagnosis, which attempts to determine the real-time operational status of a variety of metrics; dynamic provisioning, which uses status information to adjust network operation and protocol parameters in order to improve performance; interactive visualization, which attempts to aid network understanding through interactive and scalable display techniques; and finally, management and planning, which takes a longer-term view of wireless network operations and focuses on capabilities like additional resource placement. These projects provide intellectual merit through new designs for wireless networks, work to develop a clear set of design solutions, investigation of possible alternatives within each set, and evaluation of proposed solutions. <br/><br/>The research will have a broad impact on research, industry, society, and education. It will offer new directions in research, impact wireless network design and deployment, and improve the robustness of wireless network deployments.

Researchers, especially new researchers, often have difficulty disseminating their research results not because of the quality of the research but rather because of inappropriate choices of publication venues for the particular research and/or because of poor presentation of technical material to the chosen audience.<br/><br/>This workshop will open with tutorial sessions on the organization of material for a technical article or grant application, on technical writing techniques and on the specific missions and audiences of key journals in the statistical sciences. Then each participating new researcher will work individually with an experienced journal editor as mentor to address these issues on an individualized basis for draft of the new researcher's work in progress. Revisions following this guidance will be critiqued by the mentor to assure that the new researcher's implementation of writing techniques has been successful before the article or the grant proposal is submitted for review.

Those children who struggle in the first few years of formal schooling are more likely than their high-achieving peers to exhibit academic difficulties in subsequent years. They are also at increased risk for a range of emotional and behavioral problems that are costly to society. Because the PIs have little understanding of why some children do well and others do not, this project was designed to addresses critical questions concerning the ways in which the transition to early formal schooling confers advantage on some children and disadvantage on others. From our perspective, progress in understanding the multiple pathways that may be taken by individual children requires a multi-level approach ? from genes to environments ? for characterizing development. Such a multidisciplinary approach is at the core of the program of Integrative Research Activities for Developmental Science (IRADS) research that is to be carried out by collaborators associated with the Center for Developmental Science (CDS).<br/><br/>The transition to school presents the developing child with a unique set of social, cognitive, and emotional challenges, each of which carries with it increased demands for self control. In the context of the classroom, children not only interact with new authority figures and classmates, but they also engage in novel rule-based activities and encounter raised expectations for performance. Central to the PIs exploration of these critical challenges to the child is an investigation that builds upon the success of a unique longitudinal and mixed method study that was launched in 2002 with a broad sample of 200 infants and their families. The PIs unusual cohort ? composed of equal numbers of African Americans and European Americans, with each group including families across a wide socioeconomic spectrum ? was studied from birth through the preschool years.  A complex protocol was employed to gather information concerning temperament and emotional regulation; cognitive processes and executive functioning; family and peer relationships; social, child-care, and community influences; and biological and genetic processes.  <br/>Given this rich foundation, the plan is to follow the sample over the next five years, as the children navigate the transition to school.  Assessments of the children, families, and school contexts will be carried out when the children are in Kindergarten and Grades 1, 2, and 3. In addition, the data from this study will be augmented by genetic information that we will obtain from participants in two additional longitudinal projects that are being conducted currently by CDS faculty members. The PIs efforts are informed fully by the exciting findings that the PIs have obtained to date and lead the PIs to specify unique hypotheses that span levels of analysis.  As examples, consider the following two hypotheses, one that reflects the effects of Gene X Environment co-actions on development, and one that explores the implications of early emotion regulation and cognitive processes for the transition to school.<br/><br/>-Children with the 7-repeat allele and the T.7 hapoltype are at an advantage with regard to focused attention, an advantage that will translate into better emotion regulation and/or cognitive performance and school achievement. Positive parenting and/or a structured classroom setting will be protective factors for children who do not have this genetic advantage. The disadvantages of poor classroom and/or home environment will be even more pronounced in children who also lack this genetic variation<br/><br/>-Children who are highly reactive temperamentally as preschoolers will experience more difficulty with the transition to formal schooling than will less reactive children, but this relation will be moderated by cognitive factors (e.g., high levels of working memory, skills in phonic awareness), the nature of the classroom environment, and emotional regulation.<br/>By using tracking children as they make the transition to school with a multilevel genes-to-environments assessment protocol, it will be possible to elucidate both the plasticity of adaptation and development and the impact of contextual constraints.  In addition, the project provides an unusual collaborative context for the professional development of graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and young faculty members. <br/>

Hendrickson at the University of California, San Diego, to advance our understanding and ability to control the quantum properties of single-molecule magnets (SMMs).  The miniaturization of magnetic devices to the nanometer size using conventional fabrication techniques has serious limitations, chiefly associated with the difficulty in realizing monodisperse nanomagnets with well-defined structure, composition and characteristics.  For this reason, there is a growing interest in a molecule-based approach whereby magnetic nanostructures are synthesized chemically in solution at ambient temperatures.  SMMs enable fundamental studies of quantum effects associated with magnetic nanostructures that have previously been inaccessible.  For instance, these molecular nanomagnets allow for the first time the study of quantum tunneling of magnetization.  The magnetic moment (spin) of an individual molecular magnet changes direction from spin up to spin down by quantum tunneling, not by being thermally activated to change the direction of its magnetic moment.  Research has been designed to address some of the important fundamental questions related to nanomagnetism, and to explore avenues for the implementation of SMMs in future devices. The properties of SMMs depend on many factors, e.g. spin of the ground state, shape, chemical composition, symmetry/anisotropy, and proximity to other SMMs.  New SMMs are being prepared with an eye to adjusting the various factors controlling the nature of magnetization dynamics.  The mechanism of magnetization tunneling is not well understood.  Single-molecule magnets offer the potential for data storage on the nanoscale.  Even more importantly they could serve as quantum computing devices.  Collaborations involve several physics groups in three different countries and several chemistry groups.   Graduate students will receive a high level training in physical methods, particularly those relating to magnetism.<br/>

East of New Zealand, the STF is bathymetrically anchored to the Chatham Rise, a 1000 km long submerged continental plateau. The National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA), New Zealand, maintains two sediment trap arrays only 200 km apart on the Chatham Rise. The traps, although closely spaced, sit just out of the axis of the STF and thus allow comparison of subtropical and subpolar waters under similar environmental conditions such as weather and light levels over the annual cycle without the complication of frontal migrations. <br/><br/>In this project, researchers at Rutgers University and the University of Hawaii will examine at these sites the processes involved in the formation of the proxies on which paleo-sea surface temperatures (SST) records are based and resolve the issue of differential seasonality between the organisms which are arguably two of the most important paleotemperature estimators now in use (e.g. U37 K ' accuracy, foraminiferal ‰18O values). The principle hypotheses to be tested are:<br/><br/>1. Episodic delivery of alkenones and foraminifera exported from the surface mixed layer are the underlying cause of differences between alkenone and foraminiferal temperature reconstructions.<br/><br/>2. Nutrient depletion in subtropical waters during summer months and subsurface production during prolonged winter darkness in subpolar waters are important environmental influences controlling the accuracy of U 37 K ' SST reconstructions.<br/><br/>Efforts in this work primarily and actively address the broader impact criteria of enhancing infrastructure for research. Collaborations among United States, New Zealand, and European scientists represent a significant investment in outreach with international colleagues by the US PI?s. The combined results will enhance the research of all members by disseminating shared data widely and serve to stimulate future partnerships. Additionally, training of students who will take central roles in this research addresses advancing training and learning. Better quantification of SST records will benefit paleoclimatic reconstructions and thus have societal benefits.

For these reasons, it is increasingly important for engineers to reason quantitatively about a system's properties during design, before significant resources have been expended on implementing the system. This project is focusing on design-time evaluation of software systems' architectures with respect to one key property ? reliability. Reliability is defined as the probability that the system will perform its intended functionality under specified design limits. The approach developed in this project results in a multi-faceted, hierarchical model of a system, which allows assessment of the system's reliability in an incremental, scalable fashion. The approach combines standard software design models with stochastic models used to assess system reliability. Although several software reliability techniques exist, they either assume the availability of a running software system or fail to take into account the properties of the firmware underlying the software system. This project addresses both these deficiencies in the context of several representative case studies. The results of this research are evaluated along two measures of interest: tractability (intended to address scalability issues existing in real, complex systems) and sensitivity (intended to address issues of confidence in our predictions under numerous uncertainties existing at design time). The project's results are applied to real problems in mobile robotics, a domain that is representative of many complex, distributed, and embedded systems. The results are also actively transferred into the classroom.

It falls under Component B: The Development of Resources and Tools, Category 2: Instruction of K-12 Students and Teachers. The grant develops, implements, and evaluates new multimedia laboratory activities designed to engage students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). This project involves initiating a collaboration with teachers, administrators, and students at the Philadelphia High School for the Creative and Performing Arts (CAPA) and specifically targets artistically gifted students who are often steered towards more traditionally creative areas (e.g., arts and humanities), which they may have come to view as more exciting, and away from STEM. The goals to help students understand that scientific principles permeate the creative and performing arts and that creativity and expression are also embraced by STEM. The laboratory activities are designed to provide hands-on instruction and interaction with concepts through creative exercises, such as the manipulation of music and images. The activities appeal to musical, spatial, and kinesthetic intelligences, since students directly manipulate tactile interfaces and immediately hear and see the resultant changes.

The results should improve estimates of rates and timings of a wide range of Earth system processes by at least an order of magnitude. Project activities will be coordinated with more than a dozen international partners and will utilize the expertise of the Cretaceous, Jurassic, and Triassic subcommissions of the International Commission on Stratigraphy. The grand team goal is to extend the ATS, now virtually complete for the Cenozoic Era (0 to 65 million years ago), to encompass the past 250 million years. The methods that underpin the Cenozoic ATS will be applied to the Mesozoic. Emphasis will be placed on the goodness of fit of stratigraphic signals to astronomical models, duplication of records from different regions, and high-resolution calibration to geomagnetic polarity signatures and integrated bio- and chemostratigraphy. To aid in the science, a universally accessible signal processing toolbox will be created to modernize and unite leading statistical time series techniques used in cyclostratigraphic research, as well as in many other geoscience fields. Numerical ages from the reconstructed ATS will be inter-calibrated with other dating techniques in conjunction with NSF's EARTHTIME Project. All data and tools will be documented and accessible through multiple NSF public database systems, including GEON, CHRONOS, PaleoStrat, PBDB, and others. This project fulfills an ongoing global community initiative to develop a continuous, astronomical-calibrated, International Geologic Time Scale for the past quarter billion years of Earth history.

Thus, we are building a distributed framework, called Mirage, for integrating deployment and remote testing into a structured and efficient upgrade development cycle that encompasses both software vendors (as well as software contributors and distributors) and users. When completed, our framework will produce upgrades that behave properly with high confidence when widely deployed, thereby reducing the exposure of users to problematic upgrades and facilitating the debugging of problems by the vendors. Given these benefits and the extreme importance of upgrades for most computer users and vendors, the practical impact of Mirage can be significant. We will disseminate our findings and source code through our educational program, over the Web, and through scientific publications in major conferences and journals.
0721328	The Acquisition of Grammatical Categories by Infants	BCS	LINGUISTICS	09/01/2007	06/19/2009	Toben Mintz	CA	University of Southern California	Continuing grant	William J. Badecker	08/31/2011	$375,000.00		tmintz@usc.edu	University Park	Los Angeles	CA	900890001	2137407762	SBE	1311	0000, OTHR	$0.00	Grammatical categories like noun and verb are the building blocks of structure in language, controlling the way in which words are ordered, rearranged, and modified. Hence, in order to learn how a particular language is structured, a child must first determine how the categories are structured: what are the nouns, the verbs, are there adjectives, etc. Recent research by the Principal Investigator has shown that children can use patterns in the linear order of words to draw conclusions about categories (e.g., words following the word ''you'' and preceding the word ''it'' are often verbs in English). However, many critical questions remain. For instance, there are many kinds of patterns that potentially could be used to classify words; it is not known which particular patterns infants attend to and use to form categories. Nor is it known whether categories in languages that are structurally very different from English could be learned in similar ways. Consequently, it is not yet understood precisely what kinds of learning mechanisms infants have at their disposal, and what kinds of computations they carry out to categorize words. This project addresses these issues in a series of experiments with adults and infants, using both real and artificial languages, to investigate how very young children categorize words. Concurrently, the project undertakes computational analyses of languages that are very different from English in how their word-order properties.<br/><br/>This project addresses crucial questions about the learning processes and representations involved in fundamental aspects of language learning in children. Understanding how children initially categorize words is crucial to understanding how they acquire the syntax of their language, and how they learn word meanings. The answers to these questions could have a significant theoretical impact on the field of language acquisition and will potentially inform theories on developmental language disabilities, and second language acquisition in adults.

Galloway<br/><br/>This proposal is concerned with research projects at the<br/>interface of spacetime geometry and general relativity. In<br/>particular, properties of marginally trapped surfaces, which have<br/>played an important role in theory of black holes, will be<br/>investigated. Although physically well motivated, very few<br/>rigorous results about marginally trapped surfaces, and<br/>associated objects, such as dynamical horizons, had been known<br/>til recently. This situation has changed, and there are now<br/>rigorous results concerning existence, uniqueness, and other<br/>issues. Motivating this study in part is the realization of a<br/>deeper connection between marginally trapped surfaces in<br/>spacetime and minimal surfaces in Riemannian manifolds. The PI<br/>will conduct research on a number of topics pertaining to<br/>marginally trapped surfaces, such as the topology of black holes,<br/>rigidity and regularity of outermost marginally trapped surfaces,<br/>and aspects of dynamical horizons. String theory has increased<br/>interest in gravity in higher dimensions, and, in particular,<br/>there has been a great deal of recent research concerning black<br/>holes in higher dimensional spacetimes. Schoen and the PI<br/>recently obtained a generalization to higher dimensions of a<br/>classical result of Hawking concerning the topology of black<br/>holes. One part of the present proposal, involving joint work<br/>with Schoen, concerns an effort to obtain an important<br/>strengthening of this result, which would close a gap in the<br/>conclusion concerning allowed topologies. This circle of ideas<br/>should also be useful in obtaining lower entropy bounds for<br/>higher dimensional stationary black holes in the asymptotically<br/>AdS setting that extend known results in four dimensions. The PI<br/>will also conduct research on a continuing project with Andersson<br/>and Cai concerning the positivity of mass for asymptotically<br/>hyperbolic manifolds, and research pertaining to a problem of<br/>Penrose concerning the classical stability of string theory.<br/><br/>Modern theories of gravity are geometrical in nature. The<br/>gravitational field and other fields, black holes and related<br/>objects, may be described and analyzed using geometric<br/>methods. In more general terms, this project is concerned with<br/>the study of certain features of gravity of current scientific<br/>interest from this geometric point of view, utilizing the tools<br/>of Riemannian geometry, a mathematical theory of space, and<br/>Lorentzian geometry, a mathematical theory of spacetime. These<br/>theories provide a method for studying the relationship among<br/>three fundamental aspects of the spacetime universe: curvature<br/>(i.e., the bending of space or spacetime), topology (i.e., the<br/>global shape and complexity of space or spacetime) and causal<br/>structure structure (i.e., the large scale behavior of light rays<br/>and light cones).

As a consequence, computer scientists have developed techniques that deliver improved average-case performance and/or design convenience at the expense of timing predictability. For embedded software, which interacts closely with physical processes, timing is usually an essential property. Lack of timing in the core abstractions results in brittle and non-portable designs. Moreover, as embedded software becomes more networked, the prevailing empirical test-based approach to achieving real-time computing becomes inadequate.<br/><br/>This project reintroduces timing predictability as a first-class property of embedded processor architectures. It tackles the problem from the hardware design perspective, developing precision timed (PRET) machines as soft cores on FPGAs. It shows that software on PRET machines can be integrated with what would traditionally have been purely hardware designs. This project seeks to reinvigorate research in an area of computer science and computer architecure that have stagnated in research due to maturing industrial practice. This is expected to provide a starting point for a decades-long revolution that will once again make timing predictability an essential feature of processors. This project addresses the core abstractions of computing. Rather than attempting to correct the lack of timing in these abstractions with more layers of abstraction, this project has the goal of showing that embedded processors can deliver both predictable timing and high performance. It opens up the field to new computing abstractions that include timing as a first-class property.

They will analyze DNA insertions and deletions within genes in order to determine which bacterial groups branched first within the tree of life. This process, called rooting, allows one to date early events in the evolution of life on Earth, such as the creation of 20% of Earth's atmosphere by the oxygen producing cyanobacteria. Their lab will correlate the appearance of novel molecular and genetic mechanisms, including oxygenic photosynthesis, with geological, climatological, and other environmental changes and thereby help understand early evolutionary events. <br/><br/>Rooting the bacterial tree of life may contribute significantly to related scientific fields including microbiology, geology, paleontology, biochemical evolution, and genomics. The knowledge thereby obtained may also have important practical applications related to climate change and renewable energy sources. Representatives of underrepresented groups will also be involved in the research.

Turnquist	07/31/2008	$14,958.00		palombit@rci.rutgers.edu	33 Knightsbridge Road	Piscataway	NJ	088543925	8489320150	SBE	1392	0000, 1392, OTHR	$0.00	This research seeks to clarify the evolutionary forces shaping the behavioral and hormonal profiles of male primates. In particular, it will explore the correlations between male endocrinology and male-male competition, parental effort and female reproductive state, in the context of monogamous and polyandrous mating systems. <br/>Data will come from behavioral observation and non-invasive hormonal sampling of four monogamous and three polyandrous groups of siamangs (Hylobatidae: Symphalangus syndactylus) in Sumatra (Indonesia). Non-biohazardous hormonal extracts will be stored in the field and analyzed in the U.S.<br/>These data will shed light on the co-evolution of many striking and poorly understood aspects of primate, including human, social and reproductive biology, such as intra- and intersexual aggression, pair bonding and paternal care. The intellectual contributions of this work fall into four broad areas:<br/>First, this study will provide the first hormonal data on a wild monogamous and polyandrous (nonhuman) hominoid. These mating systems are extremely rare among mammals (about 3%), thus, these data are essential for the improvement of current models of mammalian social evolution.<br/>Second, this investigation evaluates the hormonal and behavioral responses of pair-bonded males to different reproductive challenges (sexual competitors within or outside the social group). These data will therefore test the hypothetically important role of mate guarding in human male competition, and will expand the breadth of theories so far tested only in humans, such as mate poaching.<br/>Third, paternal care is a conspicuous feature of human behavioral biology, but rather exceptional among primates. By providing data on an additional biparental ape, this study will allow us, for the first time, to assess the generality of these human patterns, and clarify the conditions and constraints associated with male parenting.<br/>Finally, recent experimental data shows that human male behavior is affected by female reproductive state (through visual or olfactory cues). An evaluation of similar effects on siamangs will contribute to the understanding of the origin and function of signaling versus concealment of ovulation in human and non-human primates. It will also help determining the social and ecological conditions under which female reproductive status affect male social and reproductive behavior.<br/>One broader impact of this research is its contribution to conservation efforts: the study will improve the understanding of siamang demography and population dynamics, and will provide an accurate assessment of the impact of habitat deterioration and fragmentation.<br/>The project will employ and train at least five local field assistants. In addition, the fieldwork of two Masters students at the University of Indonesia will be supported and supervised. Plans are being discussed to establish a primatology field school at Way Canguk, to further local education/conservation efforts.<br/>Results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and participation in professional meetings. This will help to guide future studies of proximate mechanisms (e.g. focusing on other hormones), psychological correlates, dispersal patterns, and female reproductive strategies in this group of socially monogamous apes.<br/>Finally, this project will provide the awardee's with extensive practice with field endocrinology and laboratory procedures, and it will broaden the range of subjects he can offer to teach, as well as the expertise that he will bring to future working places.
0721796	Group Influences on Approach and Avoidance Motivation	BCS	SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY	09/01/2007	08/14/2007	Ernest Park	OH	Cleveland State University	Standard Grant	Kellina Craig-Henderson	08/31/2009	$180,000.00	Verlin Hinsz	e.s.park@csuohio.edu	2121 Euclid Avenue	Cleveland	OH	441152214	2166873630	SBE	1332	0000, OTHR	$0.00	Groups are routinely asked to perform tasks and to make important decisions. It is often assumed that groups are less biased and more capable than individuals when accomplishing goals. However, past research shows that sometimes groups can exaggerate existing biases and perform worse than individuals. Clearly, it is still necessary to investigate the processes associated with working in groups to understand how situational and social forces can enhance collective efforts. The proposed research attempts to further this aim by applying an approach and avoidance motivational framework to small group processes and behavior. When the approach motivational system is activated, individuals focus on rewarding cues in the environment, and respond eagerly and with stronger goal-directed efforts. The avoidance motivation system leads individuals to respond vigilantly to threat signals, and proceed with caution until safety is assured. A number of factors related to the approach and avoidance motivation systems are also associated with groups. Activation of the approach system increases in the presence of potential rewards, while activation of the avoidance system increases in the presence of potential threats. Because involvement in groups is seen as personally beneficial, people are predicted to feel more confident, eager, and effective working in groups. Also, because groups provide their members with a sense of safety and security, they are predicted to see threats as less severe. Across two studies the proposed research explores whether working in groups increases approach and decreases avoidance motivation. Due to their influences on a broad range of circumstances, integrating knowledge on approach and avoidance motivation systems will be helpful in explaining the processes and experiences of group involvement. In particular, this research will help uncover how groups systematically impact thoughts, feelings, decisions, and actions. <br/><br/>The knowledge gained from the proposed research can enhance decision making processes and outcomes across a variety of important contexts. If decision-making groups heighten approach motivation, then they may eagerly pursue rewarding outcomes and goals. If group involvement decreases avoidance motivation, then group members may be less sensitive than individuals to threats and less likely to be concerned with potential negative consequences. These propositions can help explain group overconfidence, perceived invulnerability to threats, and group risk taking. A main aim of the proposed research is to increase the effectiveness of group decisions to prevent disastrous outcomes and to utilize the strengths of groups to achieve better solutions. In addition to these societal benefits, this research provides valuable teaching, training, and learning experiences for the undergraduate and graduate students involved in all stages of the research process.

The system will be built by Dr. Mark Grasmueck at the University of Miami - RSMAS based on a prototype design previously funded (EAR-0323213). The system will include a commercially available MALA Geosciences RAMAC GPR system and shielded antennas, a rotary laser positioning system, which allows for cm accuracy positioning of antennas that can be rapidly (relative to standard GPR gridding techniques) relocated during deployments, and software to fuse the GPR and laser positioning time series data. The GPR system will allow for rapid 3-D high resolution, georeferenced and time series (4-D) imaging of the near subsurface. PI studies of the stratigraphic relationships within tephra deposits from near vent to distal regions will help to improve models of tephra dispersal and eruption mechanisms. Studies of the role of sinkholes in carbonate aquifer fluid migration have ramifications for mitigating geohazards and for water resources management. The PIs will develop a new graduate course in the geosciences to expose students to GPR applications and data analysis. Courses in archeology and forensic anthropology will also utilize the GPR system.

The approach is to use Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technology to make imaging probes small, inexpensive and scan fast. <br/><br/>This project addresses the challenges of endoscopic imaging from both device and system architecture level. A new class of fast-scanning optical microsystems will be developed. One of the micromirrors can scan vertically up to 3 mm with no lateral shift. These MEMS devices can form a compact free-space interferometer that fits into endoscopic catheters. This further enables a new endoscopic OCT architecture that does not need a reference optical fiber and thus completely eliminates the problems of fiber length matching, dispersion and polarization compensation. The PI has extensive experience in this field and has good facility access to carry out this project.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/><br/>The proposed rapid scanning optical MEMS devices can also be applied to displays and optical telecommunications. The enabled single-fiber imaging probes can be used for early cancer diagnosis and real-time cancer surgery monitoring, which could potentially save hundreds of thousands of lives and improve their quality of life. The same technique is applicable to intravascular imaging for heart disease. Tiny laser scanning displays enabled by 2-D micromirrors will be demonstrated in nearby high schools to attract more youngsters interested in engineering and science. The PI will also participate in the STEP-UP program at University of Florida that is designed to promote academic and personal success among minority freshman engineering students.

First, the mathematical framework for a stability analysis of displacement fields near equilibrium will be developed, and the Green's tensor for the half-space fault eigenvalue problem will be derived. Next, using rigorous mathematical analysis, questions of convergence will be addressed as the depth of the medium increases, and convergence rates will be verified by high-order numerical schemes for hypersingular boundary integral equations. Finally, closed form recovery formulas hinging on the dominant term of the depth asymptotics will be derived and combined with a fast minimization method. The PI will infer robust algorithms for solving the fault inverse problem. Reconstruction methods will be tested first on synthetic data and then used on data coming from field measurements of surface dislocations.<br/><br/>This research project is expected to impact the advancement of scientific risk assessment for areas prone to devastating earthquakes. Earth science is seeking to understand the physics involved in seismic activity. It has established that most earthquakes occur near faults. If we knew the approximate geometry and location of faults, we could perform computer simulations of seismic activity, thus assessing risk in given areas. Unfortunately, the approximate location of faults is not always known. Due to recent developments in GPS technology, minute surface displacements can now be measured with remarkable accuracy. The proposed research will use these measurements to build methods for locating faults more precisely and for portraying their geometry. The PI will also investigate the exciting prospect of making progress in addressing a long-standing problem: is there a way to confidently assert whether an earthquake is imminent? For this question too, our work will be based on adequate data processing of surface displacements.

Sims, Princeton University<br/><br/>This research advances knowledge in four areas related to the use of quantitative models to guide macroeconomic policy. One component is study of the foundations of statistical inference for models with large numbers of parameters. The models in use at central banks and other macroeconomic policy institutions often involve hundreds of parameters whose values have to be determined from the data, yet much of the existing literature on inference in models of economic time series focuses on methods that apply only when the number of parameters is small. Some statisticians have argued that when there are large numbers of parameters, the Bayesian inferential methods that underlie standard decision theory perform poorly. While this assertion has been rebutted in the context of some specific models, this project's research develops a more general treatment of the issues.<br/><br/>It is now for the first time becoming feasible to construct models of the scale needed in monetary policy analysis at central banks that are both statistically reliable and equipped with a detailed interpretation, in terms of economic behavior, of the equations that constitute the model. There remain several competing approaches, however, varying especially in the relative weight put on statistical reliability versus economic behavioral stories about the equations. The second component of this project advances a particular approach to this type of modeling. In attempting to tell behavioral stories, while at the same time preserving statistical reliability, much of the existing work in this area has ended up with behavioral models that include frictions and costs of adjustments that are necessary to match the data, but not fully convincing as behavioral stories. This project treats the behavioral model not as itself a description of the data, but instead as a source of approximate, probabilistic predictions about the behavior of a reliable statistical model, particularly in the long run. Specifically, the project develops methods to use a fully interpreted equilibrium model to generate a prior distribution for the parameters of a structural vector auto-regression (SVAR). The equilibrium model is a restricted version of the SVAR, and the restrictions are relaxed probabilistically, especially at high frequencies where we think the behavioral model does not allow for realistically complex frictions and inertias. This approach may make it unnecessary to rely on arbitrary-seeming adjustment costs in the behavioral model, with no sacrifice in statistical reliability. <br/><br/>If we recognize that economic agents can process information at only a finite rate, many of the inertial and random aspects of behavior emerge as optimal, given information constraints. This project extends previous research, which has developed this insight formally only for simple, single-actor models, to more realistic models of market interaction. In a way this third part of the project complements the second, as it seeks to provide a more firmly micro-founded theory for the dynamics of behavioral models.<br/><br/>The fourth component of the project concerns the relation between government debt and deficits and control of inflation. So long as markets are confident that deficits will be cut if debt grows large and increased if it grows very small, the usual interest-rate-setting tools of monetary policy can control the price level without reference to fiscal variables. But in many countries markets realistically do not have this confidence, which results in complex interactions between monetary and fiscal policy. These interactions are studied empirically in this project. The results could be relevant to US policy as the fiscal pressures of from an aging population increase.

The project is funding about 13 students who are the target of this program with $10,000 each year for four years. These S-STEM Scholars are guaranteed scholarship support at the level granted for the freshman year provided they maintain program eligibility and financial need. <br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this project is its focus on the recruitment and retention of eligible students into the STEM disciplines. The target audience for recruitment includes the normal pool of student applicants plus students in nineteen Pennsylvania Upward Bound programs and twelve Math and Science Upward Bound programs in Pennsylvania and surrounding states (several thousand students). The retention efforts are built on well established principles including (1) social activities centered on academic programs, (2) peer mentoring, (3) time management instruction, and (4) emergency intervention services. Retention activities also include a host of placement testing, tutoring, and academic services designed to help students get past hurdles such as Calculus I or the transition from high school to college. Off-hours tutoring and living/learning communities are strategies that have helped the scholars make good progress in their degree programs. The broader impact of this project is to increase the overall number of students both entering the STEM disciplines and graduating in these disciplines due to the intensive retention and student support efforts.

To identify and attribute pollution transport events, FLEXPART particle dispersion model simulations of the transport of anthropogenic and boreal wildfire emissions to Pico will be conducted, and all events with observed anthropogenic impacts and minimal boreal fire impacts will be analyzed. Tropospheric O3, CO, and NO2 from the TES, OMI, and SCIAMACHY satellite sensors will be analyzed to assess the importance of the sampled events relative to the total column. Data will be analyzed in conjunction with GEOS-Chem chemical transport model (CTM) simulations to evaluate the ability of the CTM to simulate observed absolute and relative enhancements in measured species and to probe the consistency between observations and simulated photochemistry and mixing. New techniques will be used that combine high-resolution FLEXPART simulations with CTM output to obtain a semi-Lagrangian sampling of CTM simulations in pollution transport events. By analyzing multiple events over two summer seasons, the data will be used to quantify the contribution of such events to large-scale impacts of continental outflow on O3 and O3 precursors.<br/> This work will lead to reduced uncertainties in estimates of the impacts of anthropogenic and boreal fire emissions on tropospheric O3. It will provide new information on variability in remote lower free tropospheric O3 and PAN resulting from inter-annual variability in boreal fire activity. This project will contribute to teaching and training by providing a doctoral research topic for one graduate student as well as an undergraduate research project; through the sharing of research findings with high school teachers in the Azores; and through a web site. It will enhance research infrastructure by maintaining the Pico station during a period of transition to a permanent Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) station. A Pico GAW station would be a valuable resource for the atmospheric science community for long-term monitoring of atmospheric composition and trans-Atlantic pollution transport, and as a base for research intensives.

Electron cryo-microscopy (cryoEM) is the most appropriate structural tool to determine molecular structures of biological nanomachines that generally consist of multiple protein subunits and/or nucleic acids with a total mass greater than 0.5 million Daltons. The goal is to develop information discovery and integration methodologies for deriving atomic models of nanomachines. Such models will be derived from 3-dimensional (3-D) cryoEM mass density function (i.e. a volumetric density map) in conjunction with physics of protein folding and informatics data. This project is made possible by an integration of the expertise of five investigators in computer graphics, computational biophysics, structural informatics and cryoEM. The intellectual merit of this research is highlighted by the computational approaches of extracting structural information from low-resolution, complex cryoEM volume densities and integrating this information into classical protein structure modeling paradigms, such as comparative modeling and ab initio modeling, for understanding biological nanomachines. The three research goals involve information discovery, information integration and validation of the proposed algorithms. The proposed research will have significant impacts in three disparate disciplines: computer science, molecular modeling, and cryoEM. Furthermore, the team will disseminate their resulting tools freely to the academic community and will host a workshop towards the end of the project. To enhance the impact of their research, the investigators will integrate research with education at each member institution with an eye towards diversity. In particular, these investigators will develop a virtual didactic course in modeling of biological nanomachines for graduate and senior undergraduate students at the five participating institutions.

How will species respond to such changes in their environment? Lineage-specific, habitat-specific, and regionally constrained information on what adaptive solutions work best in particular kinds of environments and selective regimes in the aftermath of crises is critical if we are to manage and anticipate the long-term consequences of human-induced environmental changes. Towards this goal of better understanding the effects of ecological losses on species interactions, PIs plan to test the hypothesis of escalation, which claims that as biological hazards become more severe adaptations to those hazards increase in expression. The study will focus on fighting conchs (snails of the Strombus alatus complex) and their crab predators in the abundant fossil record of the Plio-Pleistocene of Florida before and after a regional mass extinction event at the end of the Pliocene. Given a basic theoretical understanding of how changes in predation pressure should affect adaptation to enemies, and the previous inference that levels of predation peaked in the Pliocene and declined in the Pleistocene following the extinction event, escalation between fighting conchs and crabs is predicted to have slowed or halted after the Pliocene. The material that will be collected and studied for this proposal will also be used to develop hands-on, inquiry-based activities for teaching about evolution. In particular, secondary school students will be introduced to the concepts of fossils as records of biological evolution and environmental change, and shells as records of predator-prey relationships and adaptation, connecting to a number of National Science Education Standards.

This will be the first Gordon-Kenan Graduate Research Seminar in membrane science and technology, and it will provide an opportunity for current graduate students and post-doctoral researchers to come together to discuss their research and share mutual experiences while at the same time building informal networks with peers that may lead to collaboration. The last few years have seen a tremendous growth in interest and activity in membrane science and technology, driven largely by advances in our ability to control and analyze complex structures at the nanoscale. In addition, critical societal needs in the areas of bioprocessing, energy, and the environment are providing exciting new opportunities for membrane technology. This includes the development of membrane electrodes for fuel cells, membrane separations for the purification of ethanol produced from cellulosic biomass, and membrane systems for carbon dioxide removal and sequestration. The Gordon-Kenan Graduate Research Seminar will have specific sessions on Membranes for Bioseparations and Biomedical Applications and Membranes for Energy Production and Storage, along with a more general session on membrane science and technology. The discussions among the graduate students and post-doctoral researchers will provide feedback on current research efforts, and they will enable the participants to develop new ideas for important research activities.<br/><br/>Broader Impact:<br/>The opportunity for graduate students and post-doctoral researchers to interact in a<br/>Gordon Conference setting will have a positive impact on the personal and professional development of these young scientists. The informal networks that will be developed through these interactions will provide critical support for the students as they pursue their professional careers, including encouragement for young researchers interested in pursuing academic careers. Special efforts will be made to attract a diverse group of graduate students and post-doctoral researchers to the meeting, including individuals from the leading research groups in the United States and around the world.

The project is based on the theory that life evolved from prebiotic precursors that spontaneously assembled into RNA-like polymers.  Questions that are being addressed include: What molecules were potentially present in the prebiotic chemical inventory? What molecules can self-assemble to form RNA-like polymers? And what molecules could have acted as prebiotic catalysts for the formation or assembly of other molecules? There are three principal objectives of the CBC: (i) to determine the potential building blocks of RNA-like polymers and to understand the reactions which form them; (ii) to uncover possible early metabolisms and mechanisms of self-assembly that could have selectively produced and coupled these building blocks into more complex molecules, eventually leading to RNA-like polymers; and (iii) to develop a distributed, cyber-enabled approach to advancing our knowledge of model prebiotic chemical reactions that will involve undergraduate students and their local mentors. <br/><br/>The work is having a broad impact in a number of ways: through the participation of women and under-represented minorities, particularly through the HBCU partner institutions of Spelman and Jackson State University; through the development of a high school outreach program that is making prebiotic experiments accessible to high school chemistry teachers; by further developing an existing course on Chemistry of the Origin of Life and through a research seminar series for freshmen on the Origins of Order; and through plans to disseminate information about the center through radio, local public television, computer graphics, and web-based educational modules.

In particular, autonomous blimps are used as the airborne platform, and are equipped with a compact processing unit, sophisticated camera assembly, and certain sensing devices. The AVS network can be envisioned being used <br/>for detection of unusual activities in emergency and disaster control situations, monitoring of unplanned events, etc.<br/><br/>One of the main research components involves development of efficient algorithms for various versions of the video coverage problems in the context of the AVS network. The second main research component of the research involves declarative representation and automated evaluation of high-level video activities. In addition to above, the project <br/>also entails research issues that arise in the areas of robotics and computer vision. An important component of the work is development of two testbeds - one with a large number of autonomous indoor blimps with a modest camera set-up, and the other with a smaller number of larger autonomous outdoor blimps with a sophisticated camera set-up.<br/><br/>The broader impact of this project is new applications that the AVS network facilitates, especially those requiring response to unplanned emergencies and threats. The project also contributes to education and involvement of minority students in advances to science and engineering. The results of the project are disseminated over the web at http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/~hgupta/airborne.

Craniofacial variation has important implications for diet, defense, posture, balance, hearing, vision, and the accommodation of the expanding primate brain. The skull is a complex adaptive structure, and the question naturally arises pertaining to the genetic mechanisms that assemble and coordinate its shape. This project will determine whether variation in head shape occurs along similar anatomical axes among living monkeys and apes, their fossil ancestors, a pedigree of 800 extant baboons, and in laboratory mice. Computerized tomography (CT) scans will be acquired from these heads and used to measure variation in three dimensions. The genes responsible for this variation will be identified using data from baboon and mouse. Developmental pathways are shared among mammals, so mice provide an important comparative and experimental basis for primate findings. The manner by which genes structure variation in head shape will be investigated by combined comparative DNA sequence and bioinformatic analysis, and by engineering similar changes in mice to those seen in baboons. Many genes doubtlessly contribute to structures like the head, and a general challenge to modern evolutionary and developmental genetics generally is to understand whether some genes are repeatedly involved in similar changes in complex traits over the millions of years and different branches of evolution, or whether different genes in the shared developmental pathways are responsible in each instance.<br/><br/>The project will generate a large amount of data which will be posted on a publicly accessible website along with information on analytical approaches and analyses. The PIs have a strong record of training women and minority students and they will continue this tradition at all levels from undergraduate to postdoctoral. Human evolutionary studies have a strong public appeal and this project will be exceptionally popular to the public media.

This vision will be realized and test-driven via a deployed experimental wireless mesh network in an under-resourced Houston community with experimental mobile devices distributed to community residents. Residents of the community will be engaged with ethnographically-driven qualitative inquiry and analysis to better understand their needs, usage, and user-perceived performance of the wireless infrastructure. This project presents an unprecedented opportunity to holistically study all components of a wireless system, from the end user to the mesh backhaul.<br/><br/>With a multi-disciplinary approach spanning wireless networking, mobile computing, and ethnographic techniques, this project will make fundamental contributions in (i) theory and development of predictable and resilient mesh network services, (ii) design and deployment of usable and energy-efficient mobile access, and (iii) ethnographic evaluation of user impact in under-resourced urban communities.<br/><br/>This project will produce new technologies for optimizing wireless mobile computing and understanding the technological needs of under-resourced urban communities. The experimental deployment in an under-resourced and primarily Hispanic Houston community will provide low-cost access to IT for its residents. Its success will demonstrate the possibility to achieve affordable, economically-sustainable, wireless broadband access for all. The project will offer opportunities for minority students in the universities and the served neighborhoods. Our extensive collaboration with community leaders, equipment manufacturers, and health-care providers will help transfer technologies and lessons for future IT deployments.

With the goals of improving the reproducibility and consistency of the research and expanding access to the data, FLOSSmole collects, organizes, and shares comparable data and analyses of FLOSS development. A framework for organizing a system for facilitating access to the massive amounts of data collected by many simultaneous and currently unconnected FLOSS research efforts, FLOSSmole is designed to be a piece of research infrastructure. Because FLOSS development provides examples of successful computer-supported collaborative work, the project is relevant to various areas of research such as Human-Centered Computing and Cyberinfrastructure. It enables cooperation in data collection, aggregation and sharing. Furthermore, serving as a potential training ground for software developers, its development should teach us about software evolution and the understanding of how developers join and work in these teams.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: Supporting improvement of a piece of collaborative research used by academics, practitioners in the software industry, and by society in general, the infrastructure promotes international collaboration and data sharing among research teams. Indeed, sharing code, data, schemas, queries, and experience promotes teaching and learning. The project should benefit students who work on it impacting courses and projects. Moreover, as an open source project itself the resource contributes to open and share data promoting collaboration, reducing duplicative efforts, and promoting compatibility between research teams.

This project improves our understanding of<br/>superlenses and invisibility, particularly for spherical<br/>superlenses, which not only superresolve but also magnify. It<br/>also seeks to characterize exotic electromagnetic behaviors that<br/>composite materials formed from constituent materials with<br/>extreme properties can exhibit in the quasistatic limit, where<br/>the wavelength of the time-harmonic radiation is much larger than<br/>the microstructure. The investigator also studies a new class of<br/>material named massnetic materials. These have in their<br/>microstructure collections of spinning tops, each situated in a<br/>cavity in the body, and each weighted on one side by a mass that<br/>allows one to increase or decrease the spin of each top by<br/>appropriately oscillating the body. These materials should be<br/>able to store and release energy on the microscale. The<br/>investigator also explores new equations of elastodynamics, and<br/>studies novel microstructures with the unusual property that<br/>their average momentum depends not just on their overall<br/>velocity, but also on how they are deformed, i.e. on their<br/>strain. <br/><br/> Metamaterials, i.e. composite materials with properties<br/>unachievable in ordinary materials, have attracted a great deal<br/>of interest and are beginning to revolutionize our understanding<br/>of materials and the properties they can exhibit. More<br/>technogical applications of these materials are now possible due<br/>to advances in our ability to tailor the microstructure of<br/>substances, for instance through nanotechnology. This project<br/>studies how composites can be constructed from high contrast<br/>materials to exhibit elastic and electromagnetic properties far<br/>richer than existing materials. In the defence, automotive,<br/>aerospace, electronics, and other manufacturing and<br/>telecommunication industries there is a constant need for new<br/>materials. The impact of such new materials is likely to be<br/>greatest when their properties are radically different from any<br/>material we know. The project could lead to the development of<br/>whole classes of radically different new materials with novel<br/>properties. Also it should give a much needed firm theoretical<br/>foundation to Pendry's work on spherical superlenses, and enhance<br/>our understanding of invisibility.

The techniques, although tuned to the ACT data, will be useful for analyzing any high-resolution Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) experiment. The first measurements made with these tools will be the power spectrum of temperature fluctuations in the microwave background, and mass fluctuations along the line-of-sight. By combining simulations and analytical theory, the research group will compute the full covariance matrix and its inverse, and compute the likelihood of the observed values for diverse cosmological models. Applying these techniques to the ACT data will improve measurements of the mass density of the Universe, the density of atoms, the properties of the dark energy, and the properties of the neutrino.<br/><br/>Measuring dark energy and dark matter provides insight into fundamental physics and the fate of the universe. Measuring CMB fluctuations and the growth of structure opens a window to the earliest moments of the big bang. These results will likely be of broad popular interest, even as this research trains undergraduate and graduate students in widely applicable statistical techniques, and engages them in a substantive international collaboration. Releasing the user friendly likelihood software along with the data will help a broad group of cosmologists, astrophysicists, and particle physicists.

For white dwarfs seismology offers similar opportunities as well as the chance to learn fundamental physics. For example, it is suspected that the electron degenerate cores of white dwarfs crystallize during cooling, but the calculations that suggest crystallization require observational confirmation.<br/> <br/>In this project, Dr. Clemens will identify non-radial pulsation modes in ZZ Ceti stars (pulsating white dwarfs). This first step in their seismological analysis will be accomplished through two new methods. For the brighter targets (V< 15.5), time-resolved spectroscopy will be obtained with the Goodman spectrograph on the Southern Observatory for Astrophysical Research (SOAR) Telescope. Line profile variations will be used to measure their spherical degree, even at lower signal-to-noise ratios. For the fainter stars, time series photometry on the Goodman Spectrograph or the SOAR Optical Imager will be used to measure the amplitudes of combination modes, which can be used to identify their spherical degree. It is expected that the modes of 10-20 of the most interesting new ZZ Ceti stars discovered by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey will be identified during the three years of this effort.<br/><br/>This project will help support a diverse group of graduate and undergraduate students engaged in state-of-the-art astronomical research in University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill's Goodman Laboratory.

Although a number of promising correlates have been identified, debate surrounds the importance of each, and whether any of these are 'universal' in their influence on ranging decisions. Even more importantly, these behaviors have rarely been addressed in the context of genetic relatedness and physiology, parameters which are integral to the theories often used to explain how such behaviors develop. Though chimpanzees and spider monkeys are traditionally considered the only two primates to fit the 'classic' model of fission-fusion behavior, recent evidence suggests that black-and-white ruffed lemurs (Varecia variegata), a less socially complex primate, may exhibit similar social strategies. <br/><br/>This research will investigate mechanisms cited previously by examining the influences of ecological, behavioral and biological correlates on the fission-fusion social organization of black-and-white ruffed lemurs living in Ranomafana National Park, Madagascar. Specifically, this research will address how forest structure, habitat quality, affiliative and aggressive social interactions, genetic relatedness, and physiological health influence the fission-fusion patterns and social relationships within a black-and-white ruffed lemur community. By employing a multivariate approach that simultaneously considers the effects of ecology, behavior, genetics and health status, a more integrative picture of primate fission-fusion social strategies may emerge.<br/><br/>This study will be the first of its kind to document the social and sexual strategies exhibited by the only lemur living in a fission-fusion society. Additionally, this will be the first attempt to link genetic relatedness to fission-fusion behaviors in lemurs, a task that has only recently been addressed among chimpanzees and spider monkeys. Despite the heterogeneous nature of fission-fusion sociality, data from a more distantly related primate will fill a substantial gap in the primate literature. With these data, it may be possible to identify mechanisms of 'universal' importance amongst primates living within such fluid societies. Should this study succeed, it may then be possible to create models to predict when this type of social organization should be expected to arise.<br/><br/>This research will also have important conservation implications. Information on genetic community relatedness and dispersal patterns will be the first available from this critically endangered primate, and will be integral to helping establish conservation management plans with Malagasy park services. Furthermore, this will be first study to document temporal variation in the health of wild lemurs, of which only baseline data are currently available. As many consider Madagascar to be among the world's top conservation priorities, the proposed data collection is critical to conservation efforts. This research will also contribute new data for public use; newly developed microsatellite markers and sequence data will be made available via publications in peer reviewed journals and will be posted on GenBank, while biomedical values spanning a total of four years will be made available to zoos and universities through the MedArks database. Lastly, but most importantly, this study has initiated dialogue between local Malagasy communities and foreign researchers, including training and employment opportunities, as well as educational workshops in a public forum.

He will also conduct unstructured interviews among adults on the social and economic issues generating disputes in families. During phase two, he will conduct structured interviews focusing on task delegation in households, children's resistance toward performing assigned tasks, and punishment among roughly 150 participants. Finally, during phase three he will examine the issues generating conflict among nuclear and extended kin, along with support networks following such disputes using structured interviews among roughly 300 adults.<br/><br/>This research will contribute to the cultural study of child development and family relations, and the ecological and evolutionary study of kin conflict and cooperation. This is one of the first projects to explore the role of kin conflict in a small-scale, natural fertility society without much inhertiable wealth. Uncovering the determinants of variation in kin disputes among the Tsimane' will advance our theoretical understanding of human conflict by illuminating the conditions under which we should expect family quarrels to occur in other socieites. The Tsimane' offer an excellent opportunity to study the effects of culture and ecology on family conflict and cooperation since they still invest much time and energy in foraging activities and reside in clusters composed of extended family households. The research also will contribute to the education of a graduate student.

In the tradition of ethnographic anthropology, Wisniewski will explore the relationship between Inupiaq knowledge of the environment and active immersion in the environment. Through participant observation and semi structured interviews, the researcher will collect data on the ecological/economic and the ideological/cosmologic dimensions of human action in the arctic. <br/><br/>Working as an apprentice hunter, Wisniewski will explore his hypothesis that local ways of knowing the environment extend beyond taxonomic descriptions, animal behavior, and migration routes. Local modes of knowing and engaging in a sentient natural world form a relational ontological framework. Through this project, the researcher hopes to gain insight into this knowledge framework and a deeper understanding of Inupiaq personhood. In addition, because this community may be forced to relocate due to climate induced erosion destabilizing their shore, the project will contribute to the community's on-going cultural and historic preservation by providing textual and visual media materials documenting ecological knowledge, hunting and food preservation practices, as well as insights into adaptation to their rapidly changing environment.

The agronomic, economic, and social significance of this enzyme can be appreciated by recognizing that the lives of about two-thirds of today''s human population depend on plant growth that involves biologically fixed nitrogen. Nitrogenase is, however, the most complex metalloenzyme, and despite nearly 40 years of intense investigation, it has repulsed all efforts to characterize the mechanism of biological nitrogen reduction, and nothing was known about the intermediate stages in the process. Recently, however, this project has participated in the first successes at trapping catalytic intermediates, and it has obtained the first details of their structure. This information is acquired through the use of electron-nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) and electron spinecho envelope modulation (ESEEM) spectroscopies. These techniques permit the NMR determination of the complete coordination geometry and bonding of the metal ions of the N2-binding/reduction active site, the FeMo-cofactor ([7Fe-9S-Mo-X-homocitrate], and can supply detailed structures of metal-bound substrates, intermediates, and products.<br/><br/>This project has three components:<br/>(i) ENDOR/ESEEM Characterization of Trapped N2 Reduction Intermediates: This research aims to determine the structures of substrate-derived species bound to the active-site FeMo-cofactor in multiple intermediates throughout the catalytic cycle of nitrogenase.<br/>(ii) Electronic Structure of the Active-Site Molybdenum-Iron cofactor (FeMo-co) Active Site. The parallel goal is to determine the metal-ion valencies of FeMo-co throughout the catalytic cycle.<br/>(iii)The Identity of the Interstitial Atom of FeMo-co. Long after the basic structure of FeMo-co had been determined, a higher-resolution X-ray structure revealed the presence of a single N, O, or C atom at its center. This component of the project is aimed at determining the identity of this atom.<br/><br/>Broader Impact:<br/>This project will involve pioneering development of the tools, ENDOR and ESEEM, and of the analysis procedures and algorithms that together give these techniques their power. The development of these capabilities is diseminated through publications and presentations, through formal and informal collaborations, as well as distribution of analysis programs via the web. Most importantly, it is involved in training the next generation of practitioners as graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. Through these contributions it is fundamentally altering the disciplines of metallobiochemistry/bioinorganic chemistry.

The research is targeted at understanding how bacterial surface-layer (S-layer) proteins self-assemble into two-dimensional, nanoscale arrays. Strickland will exploit this natural process by patterning saccharide monolayers on gold in order to direct S-layer reassembly. The kinetics of the binding between the proteins and the saccharides will be studied using surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy, and the three-dimensional image of the S-layer protein structures will be determined by atomic force microscopy. This research project will be used as a case study for presenting the complexity of the scientific process to the general public. In collaboration with the Concord Consortium, Dr. Strickland will create open-source software, based on the Molecular Workbench, which will simulate the molecular events relevant to the S-layer protein research project. This software will be tied into a web-based podcast hosted by collaborators at Earth & Sky, which also will feature a series of video interviews that chronicle the evolution of the research from the formation of hypotheses, to the evaluation of experiments, to the dissemination of the conclusions. This podcast will be distributed as a pilot for the Chronicles of a Science Experiment, a web-based outlet that will enable the public to follow the progress of scientific research. <br/><br/>This Discovery Corps Senior Fellowship is supported by the Division of Chemistry and the Informal Science Education (ISE) program of the Division of Research on Learning in Formal and Informal Settings (EHR/DRL).

It comprises a microfocus X-Ray Computed Tomography (micro-CT) scanning system, a dedicated server for images acquisition and four workstations for reconstruction, treatment and analysis of 3-D data. The imaging facility will provide service to four of the five engineering departments in the Grove School of Engineering (GSOE) at CCNY, Biomedical Engineering (BME), Mechanical Engineering (ME), Chemical Engineering (ChE) and Electrical Engineering (EE) and research partners at major medical research institutions in New York City. The micro-CT scanner and acquisition system requested in this proposal will be housed within the Biomechanics Laboratory in the Department of Biomedical Engineering. This space is located within the Grove School of Engineering at CCNY, thus providing convenient access to all the users. <br/>High resolution micro-Computed Tomography is a recent technology that has revolutionized the nondestructive assessment of materials and tissues. It provides a unique means for visualization of complex structures composed by substances with different densities. In particular, it permits the analysis of high-density tissues (bone, calcified arteries, neoplasias, etc) and structures filled with high-density contrast agents. It also produces detailed 3-D images of soft tissue, lipid, and air within blood vessels due to its remarkable high sensitivity. Several disadvantages associated with classical histological processing of tissue, such as infiltration, dehydration and serial sectioning is avoided with micro-CT. Virtual nondestructive histology is rapidly obtained as a stack of consecutive images (cross sections) with each image a few microns in thickness. Moreover, the analysis of several histomorphometric features is automatic, reducing measurement errors, and permitting construction of complex numerical models.

Typically, one simulates network hardware and software in software using, for example, the widely used ns-2 simulator. Experimentation proceeds by simulating the use of the network by a given population of users using applications such as ftp or web browsers. Synthetic workload generators are used to inject data into the network according to a model of how the applications or users behave.<br/><br/>In order to perform realistic network simulations, one needs a traffic generator that is capable of generating realistic synthetic traffic in a closed-loop fashion that ?looks like? traffic found on an actual network. Unfortunately, the networking community suffers from a lack of validated tools and models suitable for synthetic traffic generation. As a result, all too often, networking technology is evaluated using ad hoc workloads with an unknown relationship to traffic seen on real links and hence begs the question of how believable the results of the evaluation are.<br/><br/>This project is a collaborative effort to develop a synthetic traffic generation resource for the experimental networking research community. The resource consists of (1) synthetic traffic generators for the ns-2, ns-3, and GTNets software simulators, and Linux and BSD-based testbeds, (2) a repository of datasets to be used by the traffic generators to generate traffic that is statistically equivalent to traffic found on a variety of network links including campus networks, wide-area backbone networks, corporate intranets, wireless networks, etc, and (3) a set of traffic analysis tools to enable researchers to generate empirical models of traffic on network links of interest and to use these models to drive the synthetic traffic generation process.

It will support Sottile''''s basic research in real algebraic geometry and Schubert calculus and his interdisciplinary work on applications of algebraic geometry. These all have a substantial combinatorial component and an essential omputational/experimental core. This activity will result in a better understanding of real solutions to systems of polynomial equations through experimentation and conjectures by obtaining tighter fewnomial upper bounds and by developing a theory of lower bounds for the number of real solutions to structured polynomial systems. It will also result in the dissemination of ideas and techniques from algebraic geometry to other fields and the development of new directions in mathematics inspired by problems from these fields. Some of this work will be carried out by Sottile''''s research team at Texas A&M consisting of students and postdocs, and will include substantial experimentation. This team approach to research and training is consciously modeled on work patterns in the other sciences. It will also support Sottile''''s efforts organizing large-scale international and interdisciplinary scientific meetings.<br/><br/><br/>While algebraic geometry is concerned with basic questions about solutions to equations, its value to other disciplines is through concrete objects and computational tools, as applications require knowledge of specific geometric objects and explicit, often real-number, solutions. Modern tools from computational algebraic geometry have great potential in applications, but their use requires a concerted effort to transfer this technology into the hands of applied scientists. This project is intended to facilitate this technology transfer.

Electron cryo-microscopy (cryoEM) is the most appropriate structural tool to determine molecular structures of biological nanomachines that generally consist of multiple protein subunits and/or nucleic acids with a total mass greater than 0.5 million Daltons. The goal is to develop information discovery and integration methodologies for deriving atomic models of nanomachines. Such models will be derived from 3-dimensional (3-D) cryoEM mass density function (i.e. a volumetric density map) in conjunction with physics of protein folding and informatics data. This project is made possible by an integration of the expertise of five investigators in computer graphics, computational biophysics, structural informatics and cryoEM. The intellectual merit of this research is highlighted by the computational approaches of extracting structural information from low-resolution, complex cryoEM volume densities and integrating this information into classical protein structure modeling paradigms, such as comparative modeling and ab initio modeling, for understanding biological nanomachines. The three research goals involve information discovery, information integration and validation of the proposed algorithms. The proposed research will have significant impacts in three disparate disciplines: computer science, molecular modeling, and cryoEM. Furthermore, the team will disseminate their resulting tools freely to the academic community and will host a workshop towards the end of the project. To enhance the impact of their research, the investigators will integrate research with education at each member institution with an eye towards diversity. In particular, these investigators will develop a virtual didactic course in modeling of biological nanomachines for graduate and senior undergraduate students at the five participating institutions.

It includes continuation of the current program while instituting features to enable increased participation by faculty from minority serving institutions and community colleges and piloting of new features. These new features include an emphasis on the following components: effective mechanisms of evaluation; effective use of and contribution to the current literature on science education research; sharing results of efforts with the larger community through publication in peer-reviewed journals, presentation at annual meetings of appropriate professional organization or designing a web site to include newly developed materials; and developing leadership skills for those faculty interested in promoting their efforts on a larger scale than just their own courses.<br/><br/>ELITE Scholars are participating in: 1) a residency institute on conducting research in student learning; 2) a residency workshop on developing leadership skills for influencing biology education reform; 3) a national conference to exchange research findings in biology education; 4) a writing workshop to develop manuscripts and portfolios in biology education research; and 5) an on-going learning community using synchronous and asynchronous digital communication tools. The emphasis is on the scholarship of teaching and learning, the professional responsibility of faculty to conduct rigorous evaluations of their own teaching practices and to publicly share their findings to develop a community of practice. <br/><br/>The intellectual merit is that in addition to introducing the above features the project includes a deliberate effort to gather from these pilot projects information concerning not only the outcomes resulting from faculty attendance; but also information concerning effective components of the workshops and needed changes and then using this information to design future programs. The program is serving as a national model for an effective approach to educational reform in the sciences. <br/><br/>The broader impacts are: the number of faculty that are being empowered to effectively communicate effective approaches to profit from and add to the literature on microbiology undergraduate education; and the number of students who will benefit from these efforts. The impact of this program is evident at multiple levels: 1) in their classrooms through change in practice; 2) on the pedagogical practices of the extended educational community through publication of their research and findings; and 3) on the growth of a community of practice through their campus, regional and national mentoring and leadership efforts. By ensuring that faculty leaders derive from a diverse range of institutional settings, ELITE is reaching a broad array of institutions, faculty and students with programs tailored to fit the specific needs of local environments.

This process is poorly understood at the regional scale because of interactions between land-use types and biophysical characteristics that differentially affect the susceptibility of forests to fire. The goal of this doctoral dissertation research project is to determine the spatial and temporal relationships between historic forest fires and human-related landscape characteristics along a gradient of drought and vegetation structure in Amazon region. Forest fires will be mapped using a historical set of Landsat scenes located along the two main road corridors in eastern Amazon. The fire maps will be used to derive the set of conditions under which forest fires have occurred and to help generate fire-probability functions for different landscapes under ENSO climatic events. These interactions will be used to build and validate a spatially-explicit model to assess the likelihood of future forest fire occurrence within the region using scenarios that include (1) increased frequency and intensity of drought provoked by El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), (2) ongoing and projected road building and/or paving in the region, and (3) alternative policies designed either to promote or to constrain agricultural expansion. <br/><br/>This research project will help predict future forest fire occurrence within these major road corridors under a variety of scenarios. During ENSO years, forest fires in the Brazilian Amazon can double regional carbon emissions from intentional deforestation, accounting for as much as 0.329 Pg of carbon. Application of the models to be developed as part of this project can play a major role in influencing public policy by highlighting the spatial and temporal contexts that can enhance the susceptibility of Amazonian landscapes to forest fires. The results of this research also can help to direct understory fire prevention and control efforts to the areas under higher fire risk in the Amazon. The reduction of forest fires along road corridors in the region can have a positive impact on forest ecosystems by averting biodiversity loss, forest impoverishment, and carbon emissions while reducing economic and health-related costs associated with uncontrolled fires and smoke. As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career. This award is jointly supported by NSF's Office of International Science and Engineering.

Genes encoding Hoxa14 and Hoxd14 were recently discovered in the coelacanth and elasmobranchs, respectively, and preliminary data suggest that these genes are biologically functional. The findings raise numerous questions germane to the evolution and development of these genes. Four Specific Aims will be pursued. The first two are to clone and genomically-characterize Hox14 genes from the lamprey and lungfish, respectively. Strategies have been designed to take advantage of the laboratory's expertise in the genomic isolation and characterization of vertebrate Hox genes. The third Aim will examine and compare expression patterns of Hox14 genes in both the skate and the lamprey. Functional experiments will be undertaken in the lamprey in order to assess the direct role of Hox14 in embryological development. The fourth Aim will delineate and examine the developmental role of putative cis regulatory elements in the vicinity of the Hoxa14 and Hoxd14 coding sequences. One such element has been shown to be involved in a clear and consistent phenotype in vivo in three surrogate systems, thus strengthening the rationale for this Aim. The four Specific Aims are independent and not contingent on one another. <br/><br/>The overarching goal of this research is to understand the role that Hox14 genes may have played in vertebrate evolution and development. The discovery of Hox14 genes in vertebrates was unexpected and their maintenance in distinct vertebrate lineages that diverged some 400 million years ago suggests that they may have played a key developmental role. The broad impact of this research is measured in two ways: (1) through employment of highly interdisciplinary approaches to problem solving, including genomics, evolutionary biology, developmental biology and natural history; and (2) by providing a wealth of research and educational resources and opportunities. The research resources include publicly available gene libraries and other reagents. The training opportunities include traineeships for undergraduates of underrepresented minorities.

Hence, slab thermal structure calculations are used in seismology, mineral physics, gravity, petrology, and heat flow studies. The work proposed here is a major departure from previous slab thermal structure studies because the plate and slab motion in these models will be calculated dynamically. This will enable the investigators to test the validity of one of the most critical underlying assumptions used in the majority of slab thermal structure calculations: the kinematic slab approximation. Current slab thermal structure models are not able to consider the effect of deformation within the slab. Furthermore, current models are dynamically inconsistent because the density structure of the slab does not feed back into the plate and wedge flow. With the increased resolution of seismic tomography and the ability to predict flow patterns from seismic anisotropy measurements, it appears that the resolution in the observations is reaching a point that serious reconsideration of the slab thermal structure tools is warranted. In addition, there are now much better estimates of slab rheology, both from the lab and from observational constraints, and testable models of slab density structure. In order to use these new constraints to their fullest potential, a new generation of slab thermal models is needed. With a new slab thermal modeling tool, the researchers plan to focus on two specific issues: what is the impact of slab deformation on the thermal structure of the slab; and to what extend are estimates of slab buoyancy inconsistent with the observed motion of the incoming plate and the slab itself?<br/><br/>The broader impact of this work will be the development of a tool for calculating a new generation of slab thermal structure models. The investigators envision that this will impact subduction zone researchers in several ways. First, they will be able to quantify a range of temperatures that bound the effect of slab deformation on thermal structure. This will give researchers temperature bounds to place on simple kinematic models. The new tool for generating slab thermal structure models will be significantly more complex and computationally intensive than current tools. However, they will also generate a set series of thermal fields for a variety of geometries approximating the major currently active subduction zones. These would be available for downloading from a website so that other researchers could work with them. In addition, they plan to make the source code for this new tool available to researchers on request and plan to create a reasonably friendly GUI front-end so that non-specialists will be able to work with it.

Particulate & Multiphase Processes Program (1415)<br/><br/>Proposal Number: 0729967<br/>Principal Investigators: Tilton, Robert<br/>Affiliation: Carnegie Mellon University <br/>Proposal Title: High Efficiency Nanoparticulate Emulsifiers<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit. Emulsions stabilized by colloidal particles adsorbed at the oil/water interface, commonly called Pickering emulsions, are distinguished by their superior stability against coalescence and sedimentation and by their ability to disperse high discontinuous phase volume fractions. We propose to develop novel nanoparticulate emulsifiers with extremely high emulsification efficiency. Atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) will be used to create nanoparticle-grafted, amphiphilic copolymer brushes with well-controlled architectures designed to drive particles to adsorb with high affinity and stabilize the oil/water interface. We will prepare two categories of nanoparticulate emulsifiers. The first type has a silica core with copolymer amphiphiles grafted from or to its surface. The second type are multi-arm miktoarm star polymers with dense polymer cores surrounded by two or more types of extended arms. These grafted brush particles have more degrees of freedom than conventional particulate emulsifiers that may allow for finer tuning of interfacial thermodynamic and mechanical properties. The conformation of the amphiphilic brushes will adapt to the local solvent environment as particles adsorb to the oil/water interface. In developing the most effective emulsifiers, the underlying mechanistic relationships between brush architecture and emulsification will be determined. The main technological goal is for the proposed nanoparticle-grafted brushes to stabilize emulsions at concentrations at least ten times smaller than are required for current particulate emulsifiers. Some of the proposed structures may be thermally responsive to de-emulsify in response to temperature cues. <br/><br/>Broader Impact. The proposed work will form the interdisciplinary training of a Chemical Engineering Ph.D. student and for part of a Chemistry Ph.D. student's training. Both will be trained in the design and physical characterization of functional materials as well as state-of-the-art controlled radical polymerization techniques. A secondary school outreach program will be developed on themes of interfacial engineering, whereby public school science teachers spend one or two summer months in the PI's lab to develop student lab modules and lesson plans on the role of interfaces in nature and materials. There will be an everyday materials theme involving vegetable oil/water Pickering emulsions and a ?novelties? theme that builds on the science of particle-stabilized interfaces to understand how so-called ?liquid marbles? (Aussillous, P.; Quearea, D., Nature 2001, 411, 924-927) work. The PI will provide the essentials of interfacial thermodynamics and help the teacher prepare lesson plans on capillary forces and their occurrence in nature. The PI will subsequently join the teacher as a guest in the classroom. <br/><br/>This research will deliver copolymer-grafted particulate emulsifiers that set the mark for emulsification efficiency, together with the brush design principles needed to meet new applications in any industry that relies on emulsions (agriculture, foods, personal care?). New applications may be made possible by significant improvements in particulate emulsifiers. For example, diesel emulsions combust more cleanly than conventional diesel fuel, and emulsifier formulation is a major challenge.

A combination of gas-phase (mass spectrometric), solution-phase (NMR), and solid-phase (x-ray crystallographic) analyses will be carried out on synthetic compounds placing ammonium ions in close proximity to arene rings in order to define the parameters involved in this cation-pi type interaction.<br/><br/>This award from the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports the research of Professor George W. Gokel, of the Department of Molecular Biology and Pharmacology at Washington University. Through the design, synthesis, and study of model compounds, Professor Gokel is exploring the potential interactions between the positively-charged groups found in some amino acids and the benzene-type rings found in other amino acids. Such interactions, while individually subtle in nature, may collectively play a significant role in determining the structure, properties, and function of polypeptides.
0718461	Studies of Deep Cavity Cavitands	CHE	METHODOLOGY	08/15/2007	08/08/2007	Bruce Gibb	LA	University of New Orleans	Standard Grant	Tingyu Li	07/31/2011	$384,000.00		bgibb@tulane.edu	2000 Lakeshore Drive	New Orleans	LA	701480001	5042806836	MPS	1950	7237, 9146, 9150, MANU	$0.00	The project is focused on research related through molecular concavity. Specifically, how highly concave molecules can: 1) potentially act as supramolecular protection groups; 2) function as selective catalysts; 3) assemble into water-soluble nano-capsules capable of trapping, storing, and separating hydrocarbon gases; and 4) assemble into nano-capsules capable of controlling photochemical reactions carried out within their interiors, will be studied. The focus of the first two subprograms is on hosts soluble in organic media. The molecules in question are some of the largest and most preorganized ones in the literature. Consequently, a wide range of molecules can be trapped within their concave binding sites. The second two subprograms rely on water-soluble hosts and the hydrophobic effect to drive their assembly into supramolecular capsules.<br/><br/>With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Professor Bruce Gibb, of the Department of Chemistry at University of New Orleans. Professor Bruce Gibb and his research group will examine how molecules of highly complex structure can augment important chemical processes or circumnavigate contemporary chemical problems. His research could make chemical synthesis more efficient and more environmentally friendly by allowing reactions that normally require chemical solvents to be carried out in water. In addition, it could also provide a new approach to separate hydrocarbon gases. The latter is important as oil reserves are depleted and hence hydrocarbon gas reserves become more important to the economic wellbeing of the country.

The conference will focus on research around building assessment systems that help teachers to diagnose student learning in the classroom but also link meaningfully to large scale accountability systems (in districts or national levels). <br/><br/>This challenge is faced not only in the US but in countries throughout the world such as in Canada, Germany, Australia, and the United Kingdom. Another purpose of the conference will be to designate clusters of people interested in developing action plans for future research and resource development efforts that capitalize on international perspectives on the challenges currently faced. <br/><br/>The project will result in a report, conference proceedings, journal publications, and dissemination via a website through CAESL and its partner organizations.

Lieberman	08/31/2012	$122,439.00		Gary.Bust@jhuapl.edu	5777 Central Ave.	Boulder	CO	803012829	2108343475	GEO	1521	9196, EGCH	$0.00	This project will infer fine-scale electron density variations of the equatorial ionosphere by developing and applying estimation algorithms to data recorded from scintillating GPS radio signals. The resulting electron density profiles will provide images of the bubble structures that are thought to cause the phenomena of radio frequency scintillations and equatorial spread-F. The project will include algorithm development, data collection campaigns, and data analysis. The algorithms to be developed will perform diffraction tomography calculations; the input data are received Radio Frequency (RF) signal amplitudes and phases from an array of receivers that are experiencing scintillations. The algorithms will estimate electron density profiles by developing and applying model estimation/inversion techniques to models such as a phase screen with Fresnel forward scattering. The estimation techniques will exploit the availability of dual-frequency GPS scintillation data that can be monitored because of new civilian GPS L2 signals now becoming available. They will also exploit the ability of GPS to make group-delay measurements; use of these data will follow development of a model predicting how group delay is affected by a disturbed ionosphere. The algorithms will be applied to data from two types of equatorial scintillation collection campaigns. One type of campaign will collect data using small arrays of wide-band digital storage receivers and MATLAB post-processing to acquire and track scintillating signals. The second type will use a medium sized array of real-time GPS software radio receivers. Some of the effort will go toward completing development of the latter type of receiver. Two distinctive features of this project are its use of very robust receiver technology, which will enable collection of very accurate RF amplitude and phase data for very strong scintillations and its development of generalized estimation/inversion algorithms. These algorithms that go beyond the capabilities of currently existing or proposed algorithms in their use of multi-frequency data, in their problem formulations, and in their algorithmic implementation based on optimization or fixed-point methods. The project focuses on very strong scintillations since these are the most important from an operational standpoint since they have the biggest impact on communications and navigation signals. The project's broader impacts include the development of instruments that can be used in education as well as in research and the improved communication and navigation system reliability that will result from an improved understanding of scintillations.

There is also an imbalance in the kind of role models and mentors that are available to enhance quantitative training for a diverse group of students including under-represented minorities and women. To address this need, the current project involves 3, three-day conferences to be held in conjunction with at least three days of programs at APA annual meetings in Boston in 2008, in Toronto in 2009, and in San Diego in 2010. The three-year project builds on three previous years of quantitative training. Quantitative training and support will be provided for 40 minority students each year by a group of 10 experts drawn from major quantitative societies. Selection of the 40 participants will be based on (a) interest and achievement in quantitative and research methods; (b) perceptions of how they will benefit from the quantitative training; (c) future goals relevant to quantitative and research methods; and (d) indication that they come from an under-represented group. Conference format involves: several faculty presentations donated from top experts, student interactions with faculty, and student research presentations each day Conference coordinators are members of two major quantitative organizations, the Society of Multivariate Experimental Psychology (SMEP) and Division 5 (Statistics) of the American Psychological Association (APA), of which both recognize the need to train a wider range of individuals pursuing the study of quantitative methods. The approach draws on an organizational theory of diversity that emphasizes addressing social isolation through mentoring networks as well as establishing institutional responsibility for diversity. Ultimately, individual students from underrepresented groups and leading quantitative organizations will help to broaden and diversify the base of trained quantitative individuals, enhancing the nature of, approaches to, and questions asked in scientific research.

The project goals are: 1) to learn from exemplary African American science teachers about how to better articulate students' cultural knowledge with science disciplines; (2) to expand a knowledge base about the socio-cultural context of science learning, culturally relevant science content and pedagogical skills, and conditions for promoting teaching and learning particularly for African American students at the elementary school level; (3) to develop a knowledge base about mentoring and supporting beginning science teachers, and (4) to advance an empirically informed national discussion about how to address the science gaps in high stakes science achievement tests.
0722853	MRI: Acquisition of an Atomic Force Microscope for Fundamental Nanotribology Research at Luther College	DMR	MAJOR RESEARCH INSTRUMENTATION	09/01/2007	08/10/2007	Erin Flater	IA	Luther College	Standard Grant	Charles E. Bouldin	08/31/2008	$158,983.00		flater01@luther.edu	700 College Drive	Decorah	IA	521011041	5633872000	MPS	1189	9161, AMPP	$0.00	Technical abstract<br/><br/>Friction is a ubiquitous yet complex phenomenon that is not understood on a fundamental level. Direct comparisons from different nanotribological techniques are rare but they provide key insights into frictional mechanisms over different regimes of size, pressure, and velocity. A collaboration between faculty and student researchers at Luther College and St. Olaf College will investigate the differences in friction measurements performed using the acquired atomic force microscope (AFM) to the tribological measurements performed by using an existing quartz crystal microbalance/nanoindenter system at St. Olaf. Coating substrates and microspheres with organic monolayer coatings will allow both groups to use identical frictional interfaces and isolate velocity dependence from other tribological variables. This work will be part of a relatively small percentage of AFM nanotribology studies that include rigorous tip characterization and force calibration. We plan to refine these methods and provide feedback to the AFM community about advantages and disadvantages of particular calibration techniques. The acquisition of an AFM is in line with Luther College's dedication to provide its undergraduate students with access to modern instrumentation and mentored research opportunities, and to encourage women to be involved in scientific research and consider careers in physics or engineering. <br/><br/>Non-technical abstract<br/><br/>Friction is a common phenomenon but it is not yet possible to explain in a simple way why friction exists. Direct comparisons from different small-scale friction test devices have been rare, but they are important for determining into why friction depends on the size of surfaces in contact, on how hard the surfaces are pressed together, and on how fast they slide past one another. A joint effort between physics professors and students at Luther College and St. Olaf College will allow for the comparison friction measurements on two types of instruments. One instrument, which is requested in this proposal, uses a sharp, needle-like tip and places it in contact with another surface that moves at relatively slow speeds. The other instrument, currently in use at St. Olaf, has a similar setup, but can measure friction at much higher speeds. We plan to use the same surfaces in both instruments in order to determine the effect of sliding speed on friction. This work will be one of the few friction studies in the world that carefully determines the size and shape of the sliding surfaces and as well as how much force acts between those surfaces. Insights gained about how to improve these friction measurements will be passed on the larger scientific community. Acquiring a state-of-the-art friction measurement system will help prepare Luther College's science students for research opportunities after they graduate. In addition, this research program will help encourage women to become interested in scientific careers.

However, they, suffer from serious interference problems which limit their capacity. We use TDMA scheduling to address these performance problems. We use a SINR-based physical interference modeling for realism, and various forms of diversities - such as transmit power control, directional antennas, multiple channels, and rates - to maximize performance. We also introduce a measurement-based modeling technique to make the physical interference modeling practical. We support these innovations by experimental studies. Our goal is developing a complete set of algorithms, protocols, and system solutions that target managed mesh networks. The protocol solutions include the routing layer and below, and are compatible with existing Inter-networking protocols for the transport layer and up.<br/><br/>The project's intellectual merit has the following components: (i) New protocols for TDMA scheduling with diversity and physical interference modeling, (ii) integration of scheduling with routing, (iii) measurement-based modeling of physical interference, and (iv) simulation modeling and testbed experiments to support the protocol innovations.<br/><br/>The project contributes to the education and training of graduate students in the two universities -Georgia Tech and Stony Brook University. The project gains leverage from existing international collaborations of PIs with IIT-CNR in Italy and CDAC in India, and strengthens this collaboration. Finally, success in this project means low cost, ubiquitous broadband connectivity. It competes well with WLANs and wired connectivity, and is expected to level the technological playing field.

With the recent and well known problems of liquid polymer electrolytes in millions of lithium batteries, there is a renewed interest in solid electrolytes for lithium batteries. Such MGF glasses make ideal candidates due to their anomalously high ionic conductivities and other advantageous properties brought about by the mixing of the glass formers. However, before wide spread application of these electrolytes can be implemented, a detailed understanding of the MGFE must be developed first. For this reason, the intellectual merit of this project is that an international research team has been assembled to form a Materials World Network of research capability from among three universities in the US and three universities in Europe. Researchers in the US are preparing the glasses and measuring the composition dependence of the conductivity and examining short range structures through vibrational spectroscopy (Martin-Iowa State University). Both short and intermediate range structures of the glasses are being examined using high resolution x-ray diffraction (Petkov-Central Michigan University) and tracer diffusion coefficients are being measured (Dieckmann-Cornell). The European collaborators are providing complimentary neutron diffraction (Brjesson-Chalmers Institute of Technology, Sweden) and nuclear magnetic resonance (Eckert- Westfalische Wilhems-Mnster University, Germany) data to extend the detail of structural studies. European collaborators are also providing theoretical modeling and simulation of both the ionic conductivity and structure of the glasses (Maass- Technical University Ilmenau, Germany) and for theoretical modeling of the ion dynamic processes that are apparently greatly magnified in MGFE glasses (Funke-Mnster U., Germany). The project synergistically combines both structural and dynamical studies of the MGFE in oxide, sulfide, and oxy-sulfide glasses to determine the nature, extent, and role of the favorable structural features of MGFE glasses. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of this project are to use new modalities of international collaboration to provide young researchers new education experiences to broaden and deepen their research abilities, and to expand and develop their professional and international awareness to enhance their global citizenry. This is achieved by providing students with unique extended collaborative research and education experiences in the European collaborators' laboratories, and by having them host European students in the US to create professional linkages and experiences throughout this program. Deep collaborations among other MWN projects in similar countries are developed to leverage learning among the MWNs and speed up the development of best practices for such international collaborations. Collaboration is also established with local 2- and 4- year colleges to draw undergraduates, especially women and minorities, to the program to foster new 4 year graduates and new graduate students. The framework of the MWN is also used to develop new modalities of distance utilization of research equipment through common operating systems and high-speed internet connections, and to develop sustainable collaborations among the partners of the program that foster long term progress on research.<br/><br/>This award is co-funded with the Office of International Science and Engineering.
0737598	Firm Size Dynamics and the Efficiency of Resource Allocation in the Macroeconomy	SES	ECONOMICS	02/05/2007	08/08/2007	Mark Wright	CA	University of California-Los Angeles	Continuing grant	Daniel H. Newlon	02/29/2008	$63,781.00		mlwright@econ.ucla.edu	10889 Wilshire Boulevard	LOS ANGELES	CA	900951406	3107940102	SBE	1320	0000, OTHR	$0.00	This proposal is for a theoretical and empirical investigation of the distribution of aggregate economic activity across firms and plants. The investigators have developed a theory of the efficient allocation of resources in the economy that is able to rationalize a set of robust facts on scale dependence in firm dynamics and firm size distributions. In particular, their theory provides an explanation of why small firms grow faster and exit more than large firms, and why the size distribution of firms has thinner tails than a Pareto distribution with shape coefficient one (a common benchmark). Furthermore, their analysis led to the discovery of a new set of stylized facts on the relationship between the degree of scale dependence and factor proportions. The investigators show how industry level forces can determine the patterns of firm dynamics even in the presence of substantial within-industry firm level heterogeneity. This approach is extended in four ways. First, the project allows for greater firm heterogeneity. Combining the theory with available models of costly entry and the evolution of firm specific heterogeneity, that lead to the presence of selection effects, allows the investigators to reach conclusions on whether observed entry patterns are evidence of inefficiencies. With this extension the investigators will also address the evidence on the relationship between firm dynamics and the age of the firm. Second, the investigators propose to extend their approach to address the phenomenon of shakeouts in new and growing industries. So far, their model has emphasized productivity shocks as the only source of uncertainty in the economy. Extending their model to include taste shocks will allow the investigators to address the expansion of an industry and the associated patterns of entry and exit. Both of these extensions require the use of numerical methods. Third, the investigators will extend their theory to include considerations of ownership and control that would allow them to address differences between establishments and enterprises. Fourth, the investigators propose to finish their current research by further documenting the relationship between industry specific factors and scale dependence in firm dynamics and firm sizes. This will involve the purchase of more data from the US Census to identify the relative importance of firm versus narrowly defined industry heterogeneity.<br/><br/>Broader Implications: The fact that the growth and exit of firms is related to both their size and their age, and that these relationships are also manifested in the shape of the size distribution of firms begs several questions. Is this the result of inefficiencies in the resource allocation process? If so, which inefficiencies are the most important? And finally, what forms of government intervention are best designed to alleviate these inefficiencies and improve aggregate economic performance? The aim of this proposal is to develop an efficient benchmark against which observed firm size distributions can be contrasted in order to assess the impacts and potential sources of inefficiencies in the resource allocation mechanism. Once inefficiencies are diagnosed, appropriate policies - ranging from anti-trust policy to improved contract enforcement, and to subsidized lending to small business- can be prescribed.

The visit will help develop a detailed international collaborative research and education plan in the emerging area of engineering and technology education. Technology education is a field in which the people involved are focused on promoting technology literacy. Engineering and technology education is a new field which combines the disciplines of technology education and engineering in hopes of developing pre-engineering programs and curricula that will help students to choose careers in engineering, science or technology related fields. This topic is of significant interest to the U.S. not only in promoting technology literacy of the general population, but also in encouraging students in K-12 to pursue careers in technological areas. By leveraging the intellectual and financial resources at both institutions, the unique collaboration that emanates from the proposed visit has the potential of producing a significant impact on future development in this field.<br/><br/>There is sufficient overlap of interests between faculty at Utah State and Griffith to indicate that they can successfully pursue the activities proposed, and that the interaction will benefit both sides. In addition, the proposed involvement of four US graduate students at Utah State University's National Center for Engineering and Technology Education (NCETE) will enable these (early-career) researchers to gain valuable international perspective and insight. These students will also participate in discussion on future collaborative activities with researchers at Griffith University. Information and presentations from the meetings will be posted on the NCETE website. Additionally, information on a plan of action will be posted on the Engineering and Technology Education Department's website.

East of New Zealand, the STF is bathymetrically anchored to the Chatham Rise, a 1000 km long submerged continental plateau. The National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA), New Zealand, maintains two sediment trap arrays only 200 km apart on the Chatham Rise. The traps, although closely spaced, sit just out of the axis of the STF and thus allow comparison of subtropical and subpolar waters under similar environmental conditions such as weather and light levels over the annual cycle without the complication of frontal migrations. <br/><br/>In this project, researchers at Rutgers University and the University of Hawaii will examine at these sites the processes involved in the formation of the proxies on which paleo-sea surface temperatures (SST) records are based and resolve the issue of differential seasonality between the organisms which are arguably two of the most important paleotemperature estimators now in use (e.g. U37 K ' accuracy, foraminiferal '18O values). The principle hypotheses to be tested are:<br/><br/>1. Episodic delivery of alkenones and foraminifera exported from the surface mixed layer are the underlying cause of differences between alkenone and foraminiferal temperature reconstructions.<br/><br/>2. Nutrient depletion in subtropical waters during summer months and subsurface production during prolonged winter darkness in subpolar waters are important environmental influences controlling the accuracy of U 37 K ' SST reconstructions.<br/><br/>Efforts in this work primarily and actively address the broader impact criteria of enhancing infrastructure for research. Collaborations among United States, New Zealand, and European scientists represent a significant investment in outreach with international colleagues by the US PI?s. The combined results will enhance the research of all members by disseminating shared data widely and serve to stimulate future partnerships. Additionally, training of students who will take central roles in this research addresses advancing training and learning. Better quantification of SST records will benefit paleoclimatic reconstructions and thus have societal benefits.

In this project we explore a style of networking that we term selectively-connected, by which we mean an end system, can knowingly manage the extent of its network connectivity in response to internal or exterior events, as it anticipates changes in connectivity.<br/><br/>While selectively-connected networking also has applications for end systems that enter outage periods (e.g., a user closing a notebook, or a mobile device entering no-coverage area), one highly significant form of operation it can enable concerns placing end systems into some degree of sleep in order to operate with much greater energy efficiency. Such sleeping not only can benefit portable devices by greatly extending their battery lifetime, but can also realize energy savings at a national scale by enabling desktop systems and set-top devices to enter states of greatly reduced processing without sacrificing their network presence.<br/><br/>In this project the researchers undertake initial designs of new architectural components for better supporting selectively-connected networking, by which sleeping hosts can retain their standing in the network or delegate agents to act on their behalf during their absence. These span: exposing selective connectivity; evolving soft state into notions of proxyable or limbo state; facilitating host-based control; introducing assistants to work in concert with sleeping end systems; exploring primitives that applications might use to express the semantics they wish to preserve when selectively-connected; and considering network links that can themselves sleep when the end systems they serve are likewise sleeping.

APEX Scholars receive scholarship funds, as well as academic support and cohort opportunities, to participate in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) enrichment activities. Other students who do not quite meet academic qualifications receive a one-time APEX Incentive Award that allows them to demonstrate academic potential at the college level. Successful Incentive students become APEX Scholars. Successful APEX Scholars who transfer to a baccalaureate STEM program receive APEX Plus scholarship to continue their educations. Virtual cohort activities link these students throughout the country. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The APEX Scholars Program is adapting successful support mechanisms developed through the college's NSF-funded Center for Promoting STEM (CP-STEM). Using the mechanism of CP-STEM to coordinate APEX Scholars, this brings together large groups of students whose shared interest in STEM allows them to learn from each other. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The program enables a cohort of students across the spectrum of STEM subjects to better understand the nature of different STEM fields. Interacting and working together within the cohort helps develop teamwork skills essential to success in the workplace. In addition, the continuum of financial support through community college programs and into baccalaureate programs offers opportunities to STEM students not normally available.

This proposal presents a theoretical foundation and practical techniques to study of the impact of policies on network security and performance. This project proposes to develop a framework to validate end-to-end security properties across different security devices. Ideally, such a framework would enable the discovery of policy inconsistencies and of security violations, and assist to correct the problems. The second part of this proposal presents novel traffic-driven statistical policy optimization techniques that adapt the policy structure dynamically to minimize packet matching overhead and distribute the filtering load. Special effort has been taken to show that these techniques are efficient, robust, and practically deployable.<br/><br/>We expect the results of this research to lay foundations for new research directions in the area of policy verification, and optimization. Moreover, the results of this research can benefit other areas such as security testing and evaluation, anomaly detection, and network defense. Thus, in general, we expect this project to significantly improve both the enforcement and performance of network security.

Comparative studies of the structure of primate skulls and teeth, field studies on dietary selection and foraging behaviors, and laboratory studies on the dynamics of feeding in captive primates have all contributed significantly to this endeavor. However, these research programs have never been fully integrated, and assumptions inherent to each limit the strength of hypotheses linking diet and feeding to primate biology and adaptations. For example, an assumption of lab research is that feeding behaviors and jaw-muscle activity recorded in the lab accurately reflect those of wild primates feeding in their natural habitats. Likewise, when applying field work to questions about the evolution of primate feeding, it must be assumed that field observations are related to masticatory function as observed in the lab.<br/><br/>The goal of this study is to integrate multiple lab and field methods into a study of foraging in free-ranging mantled howling monkeys at Hacienda La Pacifica, Costa Rica. First, using new technology designed specifically for this project, electromyographic data will be recorded from their jaw muscles while these animals feed in their natural habitat. Second, the mechanical properties of the foods consumed during the recording period will be quantified. Third, tooth wear will be quantified immediately prior to and following the recording period. Finally, feeding and ranging behaviors of individuals will be collected during the recording period. <br/><br/>Data from this study will be used to demonstrate how primates use their jaw-muscles during feeding on their natural foods and to generate ecologically relevant hypotheses relating jaw-muscle function to jaw structure. The jaw-muscle activity data will also be correlated with food mechanical properties, feeding behaviors and the progression of tooth wear. More generally, the proposed research will be the first of its kind to combine lab-based techniques for recording jaw-muscle function with field research on primate feeding ecology, behavior and dental morphology. Moreover, the integrative nature of this project will identify additional links between adaptations and function in the primate feeding apparatus, feeding behavior and diet that may not be evident from any one independent research program. <br/><br/>Broader impacts of this study include the promotion of collaboration between scientists at four universities with different areas of expertise and the training of students through their active participation in research for this project. The integrative approach will provide these students with hands-on training in field techniques, electromyography, and mechanical properties and behavioral data collection and analysis. It is also expected that information on mantled howling monkey feeding behaviors will benefit conservation management decisions regarding the long-term sustainability of these primates and their habitats in Central and South America. Finally, this project is led by a minority female researcher, thereby contributing to minority representation in the sciences.

While proposals to augment the Internet abound, efforts to modify its infrastructure have essentially failed. As a response, overlay networking gained attention as a viable an approach to provide enhanced Internet services. Another response has been the push to define a new clean-slate Internet architecture. Network virtualization is emerging as a promising new central feature of the future Internet architecture. Interestingly, but perhaps not surprisingly, the use of overlay networking in the current Internet, as well as the potential deployment of network virtualization in a future Internet both result in what we dub as multi-layered networks. The goal of this project is to undertake a systematic investigation of this paradigm, focusing primarily on routing functions. The research aims to provide a unified understanding that will be applicable in both current and future Internet environments. The project also aims to articulate fundamental differences between current and future environments that will affect how we use or design multi-layered networks. A central concern is the interaction between routing protocols in the multiple layers. <br/><br/>Broader Impact: Since the project considers both the current and a future Internet, results from this project will more broadly help improve our understanding of network virtualization in a future Internet and how it can achieve its full potential. The PI is also committed to activities with additional broader impact including: development of modules based on our research for classes and continued emphasis on inclusion of under-represented groups within the research.

Scurto<br/>University/Institution: University of Kansas Center for Research<br/><br/>Title: Understanding Interfacial Mass Transport Phenomena in Biphasic Ionic Liquid Systems with Organic Solvents and Compressed CO2 <br/><br/>Ionic liquids (ILs) have been touted as the next great class of environmentally-friendly solvents due to their lack of vapor-pressure and molecularly tunable properties. New types of ionic liquids and new applications are being developed at a rapid pace for extractions, reactions,<br/>and materials processing. Systems that couple ILs with organic solvents and especially with compressed CO2, have a number of advantages for process development. Compressed CO2 ameliorates many of the challenges (e.g. viscosity, solubility, etc.) using ionic liquids. However, there exists little to no interfacial mass transfer data and no emphasis on process intensification<br/>for any of these biphasic systems. Without an understanding of the mass transfer coefficients and related phenomena, widespread use cannot occur. Therefore, this research will attempt to establish a foundational methodology for process development using several model ionic liquids,<br/>solvents, and solutes. Advance theoretical and modeling techniques will be employed to allow rapid implementation of any specific or future ionic liquid.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit:<br/><br/>Ionic liquids are finding numerous potential uses for a wide variety of extractions, reactions, and material processing applications. As common separation techniques, such as distillation, are not feasible for some separation, there is increasing interest in biphasic fluid scenarios are most<br/>commonly employed. However, interfacial mass transfer must be known for process optimization. Little to no experimental data exists even for the most common ionic liquids and other solvents and solutes. This proposal will represent the first systematic experimental and theoretical study of the mass transfer coefficients, viscosity, diffusivity, and surface tension of<br/>solutes in biphasic ionic liquid systems. Coupling CO2 overcomes many of the challenges of ionic liquids: high viscosity/low diffusivity; low solubility of <br/><br/><br/><br/>reactions gases/substrates; difficult separation of mixtures with ILs; and most ionic salts are solid not liquid. However, there are no<br/>studies concerned with the interfacial mass transfer in biphasic ionic liquids/CO2 systems. This proposal will uniquely investigate the beneficial properties of ionic liquids related to mass transfer. The mass transfer data will be obtained using advanced imaging and processing of<br/>pendant and flowing droplets with a detailed hydrodynamic model.<br/><br/>Broader Impact:<br/><br/>A thorough understanding of the fundamentals of ionic liquid mass transport properties will allow process intensification and industrial application, which could lead to a decrease in the exposure to both society and the environment. In addition, novel processes with ILs that have achieved high levels of efficiency will also be available to the public. Compressed CO2 or, in<br/>some cases, a wise choice of conventional solvents, may also lead to the realization of the potential environmental advantage of ionic liquids. This project will introduce students to the necessary experimental and theoretical modeling skills to properly design environmentally benign alternatives and critically compare them to conventional technology. Moreover, the<br/>entire process will lead to incorporation of excellent case-studies in current courses at the University of Kansas: Environmentally-Benign Reaction Engineering and Environmental Assessment of Chemical Processing. Exhibits will be demonstrated at local events at KU, such as the Carnival of Chemistry and Engineering EXPO for undergraduate and high-school<br/>students. The PI has currently recruited a female African student for work on this project to promote diversity in education.

Eavey	10/31/2007	$11,845.00		tloughin@sfu.ca	Office of Resarch Services	Burnaby, British Columbia		V5A1S6	7787823842	SBE	V601, V720	0000, 9150, OTHR	$0.00	When two or more categorical variables are measured, questions naturally arise regarding the associations among them. Well-established methods, such as Pearson chi-square tests for independence and loglinear models, have been developed to assess the association structure between single-response categorical variables. When one of these categorical variables arises from a survey question which asks respondents to choose all that apply, the analysis is not as straightforward because survey respondents may respond positively to more than one item from the list and the responses are likely to be correlated, creating a multiple-response categorical variable. Furthermore, when the survey data arises from a complex survey design, there currently are no statistical analysis methods available to analyze association structures involving multiple-response categorical variables. This research project will develop a new set of statistical analysis procedures for testing and estimating associations and modeling multiple-response categorical variables arising through complex survey sampling. The research will build upon recently developed methods for multiple-response categorical variables in the simple random sample case. Rao-Scott adjustments, common in the analysis of associations among ordinary single-response categorical variables from complex survey sampling, will be extended to develop Pearson-type tests of associations involving multiple-response categorical variables. Odds-ratio-based measures of association and corresponding linearization-based standard errors will be derived to measure level of association. Marginal generalized loglinear models will be developed that allow the association structure to be described in terms of main effects and interactions due to the factors represented by the multiple-response categorical variables. Model-based tests for goodness-of-fit and estimates of odds ratios will be developed using asymptotic techniques. Adequacy of all methods developed will be examined by means of simulation.<br/><br/>Society is inundated with surveys, many of which include questions that invite respondents to choose all that apply from a series of items. This research will provide survey analysts with an essential set of statistical analysis tools for analyzing data from questions of this type, for which there currently is no good alternative. It also will lay the groundwork for future research including extensions to more varied data structures and the handling of missing data. Because surveys are such an integral part of our society's information-gathering and exchange system, the impact can be expected to be far-reaching, affecting areas such as public health, political science, criminology, sociology, demography, business, and technology. Any institution that uses statistically-designed surveys and includes choose all that apply questions stands to benefit from the tools provided by this research. The research is supported by the Methodology, Measurement, and Statistics Program and a consortium of federal statistical agencies as part of a joint activity to support research on survey and statistical methodology.

GLOW-II spans ten domains--Biostatistics and Medical Informatics, Chemical and Biological Engineering, Chemistry, Computer Sciences, Engineering Physics, Genomics, Genetics, Materials Science and Engineering, Medical Physics, Physics and Astrophysics--each with significant computational needs. The laboratory, consisting of eight physical sites, provides the necessary hardware, software, and support infrastructure for the development and experimental evaluation of grid-aware scientific applications. Within GLOW-II new HTC technologies will be harnessed and new organizational structures will be established to meet the computational needs of leading-edge research in the biological and physical sciences. GLOW-II enables cross-fertilization of active research pursuits within the CS department, particularly developers of distributed technologies and tools, providing the CS group with a larger and diverse real-life distributed environment that is an integral part of the national cyberinfrastructure. The technologies, applications, and organizational structures of this computing environment can provide the power to transform scientific processes and methodologies. The success of GLOW and the underlying High Throughput Computing (HTC) technologies that power it have inspired and influenced many campus grids helping shape the campus-grid centric vision of the Open Science Grid (OSG).<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: GLOW-II interdisciplinary impacts span across all ranks of the scientific community. Computing throughput, and consequently the size and complexity of the problems studied, will be increased. The infrastructure enables development of new IT technologies in response to explicit needs and their evaluation in real-life settings. Changing the national cyberinfrastructure landscape and pioneering new scientific computing paradigms, new domains will be engaged and students and system administrators will be trained. Outreach, education, and training programs will ensure inclusion of students, educators, and next generation researchers.

Software engineering for cyber-physical systems;<br/>. Sensor Network development tools and programming abstractions;<br/>. Low-level communication challenges;<br/>. Embedded and real-time computing; and<br/>. Data mining of the physical world (to identify anomalous or interesting patterns in streams of real-time data).<br/>Cyber-physical systems enhance our interaction with the external environment in a similar fashion to the way the Internet changed how we communicate. Hence cyber-physical computing represents an era in computing where logical processing is more tightly intertwined with the external physical world. These systems offer a myriad of new challenges that stem from combining processing, communication, and physical interaction with the external world. Promoting practical cyber-physical computing research entails adequate experimental testbeds that allow evaluation, validation, and fine tuning of different ideas. The fine-granularity instrumentation required serves as a unifying theme across various studies. Sensor network technology is expected to economically address this need once key sensor network research impediments are resolved. This research facility is likely to be unique in the nation in its scale.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: This work creates opportunities for interdisciplinary research where problems are solved utilizing CS/CE technology in the context of real applications drawn from environmental and atmospheric science, biology, anthropology, geology, agriculture, etc. The facility enables, among others, studies of infectious disease propagation, climate change, deforestation, and global warming. Additionally, the infrastructure offers active learning educational opportunities.

Ultimately, this knowledge might be used in a scheme to (i) enhance production of biomass for biofuels within roadway microclimates induced by vehicle exhaust and (ii) simultaneously reduce average atmospheric CO2 levels. Detailed information regarding the growth and thermal response of C3 and C4 photosynthesis plants to controlled microclimates containing CO2 spatial distributions in the range of 350 to about 1000 ppm will be generated using a novel experimental facility to be built with SGER funding. <br/><br/>The intellectual merit of the proposal is to lay groundwork for possible deployment of an elegant engineering approach to meet the challenge of increasing biomass production for biofuels while simultaneously reducing average CO2 content of the atmosphere. Novel experimentation is proposed that will shed light on the response of C4 and C3 photosynthesis biota to elevated local CO2 levels that exist today alongside major roadways in the U.S.<br/><br/>The broader impacts include: (i) possible benefits to society in terms of enhanced biofuel production and reduced average atmospheric CO2 levels, (ii) development of an experimental facility that will be useful to researchers at the evolving intersection of plant science and engineering, (iii) dissemination of results through traditional (journal article and conference paper) and non-traditional (workshop and textbook) means, and (iv) stimulation of follow-on projects that will ultimately expose students to international research collaboration for the development of a diverse, globally-engaged community of scholars. The facility will be used in the future for outreach to K-12 students in various University of Connecticut outreach programs.

The BGS is recognized as the leading international annual conference focused specifically on geomorphology. It brings together leading geomorphologists in many subfields, and its prior collected papers include widely cited classics that have affected the course of research in geomorphology and related sciences. Although 'complexity' is an umbrella that has expanded considerably from its origins in nonlinear dynamics (e.g. Chaos Theory), common threads include complicated behavior arising from simple interactions, and the emergence of overall order and patterns from myriad local interactions. <br/><br/>In the past 20 years, 'complex systems' approaches and perspectives have infiltrated into many disparate branches of geomorphology, leading to fundamentally new insights about how landforms develop and evolve. The symposium will provide an intellectual environment where the participants can review, debate, discuss, and synthesize conceptual paradigms, appropriate methods, linkages between theories and observations, and instructional frameworks for future complexity-in-geomorphology research. An integrated forum such as the BGS is extremely crucial for this endeavor. Complex-systems approaches include diverse theoretical and data-analysis methods developed in different fields including physics, mathematics, and ecology, as well as in the Earth sciences. The broad field of geomorphology includes researchers with a range of backgrounds and expertise using a range of complementary complex-systems approaches. In addition, two communities of geomorphologists exist--consisting respectively of geographers on one hand and mostly geologists and engineers on the other--both using complex-systems concepts in various ways, but attending different meetings with far too little cross-fertilization. The proposed symposium will integrate researchers and students from these various backgrounds, to facilitate interactions likely to lead to the generation of new ideas both during and after the event. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: In an era of increasing interactions between changing human land use, changing climate, landscape evolution, and ecosystems on many scales, the basic-science tools and ideas likely to result from the symposium will facilitate more effective planning and management of land use, hazard mitigation, and ecological/geomorphological restorations. In addition, this symposium will showcase the research of many scholars and practitioners, including junior scientists, women, and workers from different disciplinary backgrounds. This showcase will have a high level of quality-controlled rigor, with the published papers undergoing a thorough peer-review process and publication in a special issue of the international journal Geomorphology. Finally, the core set of ideas, methods, and goals on the subject of geomorphology will provide the basis for a new organization of teaching in the geosciences. <br/><br/>Conference Organization: The BGS 2007 will be hosted by the Nicholas School of the Environment and Earth Sciences at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina (5-7 October 2007).

Eisenthal of Columbia University and his graduate and undergraduate student colleagues will pursue studies aimed at investigating the acid-base reactivity of molecules at interfaces. They will do this by using non-linear spectroscopic methods that are primarily sensitive to molecules at interfaces. The ultimate aim of these studies is to learn how the reactivity of acids and bases changes when the species are present at an interface -- an environment that is quite different from the bulk liquid environment which has heretofore been mostly studied.<br/><br/>Acid and base reactivity is a large, ubiquitous class of chemical reactions. Interfaces with liquids are also ubiquitous, e.g. the surface of all bodies of water comprise roughly 2/3 of the earth's surface. It is surprising, but very little is known about the acid-base chemistry that occurs at these types of interfaces. Prof. Eisenthal and his young colleagues are attempting to uncover this important information. Besides the broader scientific impact of these groundbreaking studies, the young scientists supported by this award will receive unparalleled training in interfacial chemistry and physics.

While a coherent and complete description of these processes is not always possible by experimental methods, modeling and simulation approaches can provide valuable insights at atomic, mesoscale, and macroscale resolutions through multiscale modeling approaches. This project strives to achieve a multiscale description of equilibrium and dynamic processes associated with a class of complex fluids with nanoscale inclusions, namely, biological membranes mediated by membrane associating and membrane bound proteins. The primary objective is to develop a multiscale technology and apply it to achieve a quantitative and experimentally testable description how interactions at a molecular level lead to manifestation of properties at the mesoscopic level (approaching the length and timescales relevant to a biological cell). <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: At the core of the methodological advance is the proposal to devise a new strategy for integrating two different phenomenological approaches, namely, a field theoretic (continuum) description for the membrane dynamics and a discrete (lattice) description for the protein dynamics, a combination that results in a new computational technology with the power to describe dynamical behavior in complex processes involving multiple spatial and temporal scales. The KMC-TDGL algorithm is unique and innovative in its ability to combine two disparate phenomenological formalisms (Kinetic Monte Carlo and Time Dependent Ginzburg Landau) in such a manner as to allow for a two-way coupling between the two methods. The combined approach will be applied to obtain a unified picture of how curvature inducing proteins mediate cell membrane dynamics. The method will be validated at two levels. (1) Phenomenological potentials of interaction at the nanoscopic scale will be validated and parameterized by atomic-level molecular dynamics simulations. (2) The KMC-TDGL simulations will also be critically evaluated by comparing the predictions directly with well-characterized experiments. This will enable the proposed unified approach to be founded on the basis of atomic level interactions while retaining the capability of describing dynamical and thermodynamic properties at the mesoscopic level. The multiscale approach to be developed is generalizable and applicable to a variety of biophysical and biochemical processes such as protein-mediated biological phenomena occurring on the cell membrane. These include biological adhesion mediated by protein-protein interaction, endocytosis (internalization mechanism for proteins or nanocarriers), raft formation (microdomains in the lipid bilayer phase that are enriched in cholesterol), or biogenesis of caveolae (flask shaped vesicular structures formed in the membranes). <br/><br/>Broader Impact: The approach is also generalizable to processes outside of membrane biophysics such as DNA dynamics, crystal growth kinetics etc. Therefore, it is likely to have a significant impact in enabling fundamental scientific discoveries at the nanobio interface in the disciplines of pharmaceutical science, synthetic biology, nano-bio-technology, and systems biology. Complementing the interdisciplinary research program in engineering and quantitative biology, the proposed educational and outreach programs will leverage existing channels at the University of Pennsylvania, as well as introduce new avenues to build a rigorous and visionary integrated program encompassing theoretical, computational, and experimental technologies. The research program will also provide direct impact and impart strong scientific and technological value not only to several graduate students and undergraduate students through the research and teaching activities of the PI, but also to academic scholars nationally and internationally through the proposed activities for dissemination and international collaboration.
0701091	Stochastic systems with complex interactions and random environments	DMS	PROBABILITY	08/15/2007	02/11/2009	Timo Seppalainen	WI	University of Wisconsin-Madison	Continuing grant	Tomek Bartoszynski	07/31/2010	$203,000.00		seppalai@math.wisc.edu	21 North Park Street	MADISON	WI	537151218	6082623822	MPS	1263	0000, OTHR	$0.00	This project studies three categories of stochastic processes: interacting particle systems, interface models, and random motion in a random medium. The goal is to describe typical large scale behavior and to quantify deviations from the typical behavior. Examples of particular objects of study are fluctuations and large deviations of the current in the exclusion process and the zero range process, behavior of the exclusion process in a random environment, height fluctuations in the random average process, and quenched central limit theorems for random walk in a random environment. An important phenomenon to clarify is the transition between different universality classes as the parameters of the zero range process are varied. <br/><br/>This project investigates mathematical models that describe complex interactions and motion of particles in an irregular environment. These mathematical systems incorporate randomness to model irregularity and unpredictability. The goal is to unearth general mathematical laws that govern such systems irrespective of less important details. A key point is that these systems appear quite different at microscopic and macroscopic scales. So it is important to understand how<br/>different rules for small-scale interactions and motions lead to different large-scale systemwide behavior. Real-world phenomena that such mathematical studies can illuminate include the motion of vehicles on a freeway, packets making their way through a communication network, fluid particles in a tube, wetting transitions where fluid spreads in a porous medium, or epidemics advancing through an orchard of trees. Over the longer term understanding complex interactions has wide implications for science and engineering and thereby for society. Models of the kind described in the proposal are intensely and concurrently studied by mathematicians, natural scientists,social scientists, and engineers.
0709717	CNH: Effects of Cross-Boundary Processes on Human-Nature Dynamics in Wolong Nature Reserve for Giant Pandas	EF	DYN COUPLED NATURAL-HUMAN	08/15/2007	08/08/2007	Jianguo Liu	MI	Michigan State University	Standard Grant	Saran Twombly	07/31/2011	$1,493,879.00		liuji@msu.edu	Office of Sponsored Programs	East Lansing	MI	488242600	5173555040	BIO	1691	1689, 1691, 9278, EGCH	$0.00	Successfully balancing wildlife conservation and human well-being requires sound knowledge of processes operating not only within a particular coupled human-natural system, such as a nature reserve, but also of processes operating across system boundaries. While our understanding of biophysical cross-boundary processes, such as nutrient flows and invasions of exotic species, has improved markedly over the past decade, work on social processes is urgently needed. Two increasingly important cross-boundary social processes impacting nature reserves around the world are rural-urban labor migration (migration of residents from rural areas for urban employment opportunities) and ecotourism (nature-based tourism in rural areas often by city dwellers). These phenomena are especially critical and rapidly evolving in developing countries such as China, which are experiencing unprecedented increases in human mobility due to economic development over the past three decades. However, little is known about the interactive effects of migration and ecotourism on human-nature dynamics. This project will contribute to a better understanding of the effects of these interacting processes on the coupled human-natural system (forests/panda habitat and local residents) in the Wolong Nature Reserve, the flagship reserve for conservation of the world-famous endangered Giant Pandas of China. The project will take a systems approach to address four interrelated objectives: (1) evaluate the effects of ecotourism on the coupled human-natural system; (2) assess the effects of labor migration on the coupled human-natural system; (3) understand the interactive effects of labor migration and ecotourism on the coupled human-natural system, and (4) model and simulate the long-term effects of migration and ecotourism on the coupled human-natural system. The methods to be used in this study include field observations, face-to-face interviews with stakeholders, geographic information systems, remote sensing, global positioning systems, statistical tools, and systems modeling and simulation. The project will tightly integrate research with both formal education from K-12 to graduate school, and with engagement of stakeholders and the general public from local to international levels.<br/><br/>This project will contribute to the theoretical understanding of complex human-natural system dynamics, concentrating on crucial characteristics such as nonlinearity, thresholds, feedbacks, and uncertainty that are shaped by cross-boundary processes. The project will also make methodological contributions by advancing the state-of-the-art in agent-based modeling in producing a web-accessible model exploring the complexity of cross-boundary processes. With respect to the application of research results, the project will contribute to improved policy for the conservation of panda habitat in Wolong, providing insight for designing policies that balance the needs of panda conservation and economic development in the world''s most populous nation. The findings will also be of general interest to many other systems due to escalating cross-boundary processes around the world and the urgent need to develop effective policies for addressing increasingly complex human-nature dynamics.

The group was created to support and enhance the REU chemistry program, which consists of over seventy individual REU sites. The Leadership Group (LG) has four general goals: increasing communication within the REU community and with the NSF, increasing the diversity of the students impacted by Chemistry REU programs, increasing the number of REU opportunities, and improving the evaluation and assessment of the Chemistry REU program. The LG also will catalyze new projects to advance its major goals. For example, the LG will help organize a meeting of Chemistry REU site directors and representatives from the NSF Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program. This meeting, along with other LSAMP/REU workshops for faculty participants, will enhance partnerships between the two programs, facilitate the inclusion of LSAMP students in REU summer programs, increase communication within the REU community, and generally encourage the broadened participation of underrepresented groups in chemical research at the undergraduate level.

It will be used by researchers in Kansas and neighboring regions who study Caenorhabditis elegans, an organism commonly used in diverse studies in genetics, developmental biology, and other fields. This instrument will improve both the quantity and quality of the research output from the laboratories of the users. For example, it will allow the users to identify and isolate rare individuals or mutants within large populations of animals. The ability to more rapidly and easily produce additional mutations or alleles from large-scale genetic screens will be useful for investigations of pathways and mechanisms used by the organisms for development and environmental protection.<br/><br/>This sorter is relatively simple to operate, allowing undergraduates from the investigators' university and from a minority-serving university to be involved in this research, and increasing their interest and excitement about science.
0748943	CAREER: Low-Temperature Solution Synthesis Of Intermetallic Nanomaterials	DMR	SOLID STATE & MATERIALS CHEMIS	08/01/2007	01/26/2010	Raymond Schaak	PA	Pennsylvania State Univ University Park	Continuing grant	Linda S. Sapochak	02/29/2012	$410,139.00		schaak@chem.psu.edu	110 Technology Center Building	UNIVERSITY PARK	PA	168027000	8148651372	MPS	1762	1045, 1187, 9161, AMPP	$0.00	TECHNICAL EXPLANATION<br/><br/>The goal of this program is to synthesize intermetallic compounds of the late transition metals that exhibit a wide variety of important physical properties that place them at the forefront of modern science and technology. The project focuses on understanding how intermetallics can be formed using chemical methods that work at much lower temperatures, typically 100 to 550 degrees. This temperature regime (a) is more energy efficient, (b) can form new structures that are not stable at high temperatures, and (c) can provide insight into how the solids form. Because solid-solid diffusion is the rate-limiting step in the synthesis of intermetallic compounds, this project will combine concepts and techniques from solid-state chemistry, solution chemistry, and nanoscience to develop and explore low-temperature synthesis approaches that overcome diffusion problems. This will lead to (a) a diverse toolbox of new chemical reactions, (b) functional new nanomaterials that cannot be made using traditional methods, and (c) an understanding of the formation mechanisms and reactivity of nanocrystalline intermetallics. Graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in both solid-state and solution chemistry techniques as part of this cross-disciplinary project. To integrate research and education, a new research-driven course in inorganic materials chemistry will be developed, and it will contain both classroom and laboratory components and be accessible to graduate and undergraduate students from all materials-relevant science and engineering majors. In addition, a summer fellowship will be established to allow students from traditionally underrepresented groups to participate in this modern solid-state chemistry project. <br/><br/>NON-TECHNICAL EXPLANATION<br/><br/>Technology feeds off of solid-state materials, and the prerequisite to new technologies is the synthesis and creation of new materials. Some of the most important technological materials are intermetallics, which are chemical compounds that form from combinations of metallic elements. These synthetic methods also yield nanometer-size particles, which are important building blocks for creating thin films, composites, and porous materials for possible applications as fuel cells, batteries, and information storage devices. This project provides cross-disciplinary training for undergraduate and graduate students in modern and traditional areas. It also involves the creation of a new materials chemistry course with both classroom and laboratory components, as well as a summer research program focused on providing opportunities to individuals in underrepresented groups. Because of their physical properties, intermetallic nanomaterials are of high interest to industry, and students trained in these areas compete well in the job market.
0726983	Collaborative Research: Scaling up from community to meta-ecosystem dynamics in the rocky intertidal - a comparative-experimental approach	OCE	BIOLOGICAL OCEANOGRAPHY	08/15/2007	08/15/2007	Bruce Menge	OR	Oregon State University	Standard Grant	David L. Garrison	12/31/2011	$489,887.00	Sally Hacker, Francis Chan	mengeb@oregonstate.edu	OREGON STATE UNIVERSITY	Corvallis	OR	973318507	5417374933	GEO	1650	9169, EGCH	$0.00	The meta-ecosystem concept hypothesizes that the dynamics of ecological communities reflect interdependence between local-scale and ecosystem processes that vary across large distances. Thus, variation among communities depends not only on locally-varying species interactions and abiotic factors, such as physical disturbance, but also on regionally- and globally-varying ecosystem processes, such as dispersal and flows of materials such as nutrients and carbon. This study of rocky intertidal communities and the factors underlying their variation addresses the issue of meta-ecosystem dynamics. The goal of this project is to understand how variability in oceanographic subsidies, such as nutrients and phytoplankton, influences benthic community structure in the northern California Current Large Marine Ecosystem. Local-scale variation in upwelling along the Oregon and northern California coasts will be used to understand how changes in nutrients and productivity influence benthic-pelagic coupling, its effect on benthic species interactions, and ultimately rocky intertidal community structure. A conceptual model, in which the independent variable is seawater temperature (SWT), is used to predict how the dual effect of nutrients and light on marine benthic and pelagic primary production generates different community outcomes in the low intertidal zone. The two endpoints of community structure are a dominance of filter feeding invertebrates or macroalgae. The model predicts that with low (cold) SWT, nutrient and light availability is high, and macrophytes are dominant. Under very high nutrients and light, competitively dominant kelps will prevail and possibly facilitate stress-intolerant macroalgal species, and as nutrients and light diminish, kelp dominance should switch to dominance by surfgrass and foliose understory algae. With higher (warmer) SWT, conditions favor high phytoplankton production, leading to dominance by sessile invertebrates. High phytoplankton also creates low light and low nutrient conditions, negatively affecting growth of macroalgae and their ability to compete with sessile invertebrates. Research will be conducted at 15 sites nested within five capes spanning the 1300 km range of the study region. A water sampling program will quantify concentrations of nutrients and phytoplankton, field-deployed remote sensors will provide time-series estimates of light and chlorophyll a, and surveys will quantify community structure. Manipulative field experiments will test the role of species interactions on community structure and how interactions vary with ecological subsidies.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: Three of the PIs (Hacker, Menge, Nielsen) have undergraduate and graduate teaching responsibilities, which involve instruction and training in marine ecology. Each makes a major effort to foster the participation of underrepresented groups in lab and field activities; Menge, Hacker and Nielsen''''s lab groups consist mostly or entirely of women. Nielsen''''s position at Somona State University (SSU), a four-year undergraduate institution with few funded research programs, offers a rare chance for SSU undergraduates to participate in a first-rate research experience. Finally, the work will provide insight into the consequences of predicted changes in upwelling regimes due to human activity and climate change, thereby giving the research societal significance. Knowledge of the importance of benthic-pelagic coupling to the dynamics of rocky intertidal communities is crucial to manage and conserve marine communities facing human-induced variation in climate. The PIs will work with a policy and outreach program to communicate the research beyond academic circles to the wider public and stakeholders.

It has become a common trend for many fab-less companies and government agencies to ship their designs offshore for low-cost fabrication. These trends have raised serious concerns regarding possible threats or attacks on US military systems, critical sites and even household appliances that rely on high performance chips. There are various potential vulnerabilities to such systems caused by malicious alterations of hardware processes that might make these vital systems inoperable at some future time. Such malicious manipulation of ICs slated for installation in US weapon systems cannot be tolerated.<br/><br/>The focus of this research is on the development of automatic test pattern generation (ATPG) and signal analysis techniques for detecting and locating malicious alterations, e.g. the insertion of Trojan circuits, during wafer probe aor package test as a means of improving the level of trustworthiness of the chip. In particular, techniques that significantly improve the resolution of quiescent current and transient current techniques for detecting and locating Trojan circuits are investigated. A second focus of the project is on the development of ATPG methods designed to detect hidden alterations of the chip, e.g., inserted or weakened wires or transistors which cause the chip to fail later in the field.

New ligand scaffolds and templates based on novel design elements continue to appear all the time; however, explanations for the origin of ligand-induced enantioselectivity range from the very complete and well-tested to the merely plausible, educated guesses. The objective of this research program is to answer the how and why questions about electronic control of chiral ligand function.<br/><br/>Knowledge of how electronic ligand effects are transmitted across palladium(II) centers in our ligands will enable others to design and synthesize new chiral ligands of many other types with different applications and with greater efficiency and effectiveness.<br/>The proposed research will be conducted at a predominantly undergraduate institution (PUI), Middlebury College, with only undergraduate students as collaborators. This type of research experience has proven to encourage undergraduates to pursue careers in science or further their science education by attending graduate school.

Teaching sensor network concepts is challenging because the field draws upon a disparate set of computing disciplines. For sensor network programming education, some tutorials exist, but their target audience is largely graduate students and professional researchers.<br/><br/>The PIs' experience shows that the presentation of these tutorials is difficult for undergraduate students as they do not have the prerequisite knowledge necessary. In the past, no lab exercises were available that are appropriate for activity-based teaching of this new and exciting field to undergraduates.<br/><br/>To fill this void, this CSR-CSI project is developing exemplary laboratory exercises at two institutions: Lewis & Clark College, a small private liberal arts institution, and Portland State University, a Ph.D.-granting research university. With input from students, industrial advisors, and an educational consultant, the PIs are developing exemplary lab exercises, identifying topics that are appropriate, clarifying prerequisite knowledge and preparatory material, and presenting the material in a format that is suitable for undergraduates.<br/><br/>The intellectual merits of this work are in clarifying the prerequisite knowledge to employing and programming sensor networks, and building a foundation for teaching these topics to undergraduates. This project also enriches the scientific and engineering research capability of the US, and provide undergraduates with activity-based learning. The effectiveness of the materials is tested on undergraduates at institutions serving a large population of minorities and women.

Endosperm cell walls are composed mainly of arabino(glucuron)xylan (AGX, 70%) and mix-linked glucan (MLG, 20%). The deposition of these polymers during endosperm development is highly ordered, which makes wheat endosperm an excellent system to use for the identification of genes involved in AGX biosynthesis. No AGX-biosynthetic genes have been identified. Therefore, success in identifying the polypeptides involved in this process will open new avenues to crop improvement and contribute to plant-breeding programs. The objective of this project is to identify and analyze the function of candidate genes, namely xylan synthase (TaXylS) genes involved in AGX biosynthesis in wheat. This work will lead to a basic understanding of AGX biosynthesis as it relates to cell wall biosynthesis and growth of seeds. Results may provide an initial step for engineering plants with improved cell wall properties to meet the needs of the wood, paper, textile, fuel, and food industries. <br/><br/>This project will provide valuable research and training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students. All students will be trained in cell, developmental, molecular and computation biology. Ohio University is located in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains in southeast Ohio, a predominantly rural setting, and draws 25% of its undergraduate population from the surrounding Appalachian region of Ohio and West Virginia.

Network administrators can use the techniques developed by the project to prevent undesirable applications (peer file sharing, network games, etc.) from being run on the network merely by adjusting network performance. For example, some network games can be made intolerable by varying jitter or live audio can be disrupted by high loss rates, without impacting applications like web browsing, remote file access, or email. This technique works even if you cannot log into computers connected to the network and it is much harder for users to evade. The project will build practical tools that allow network administrators to control their networks in this manner and provide insight into how to use those tools for common cases. A major challenge for this approach is to find fundamental required network conditions that control important applications such that no attempt by programmers or users to work with the applications in the face of those degraded conditions is likely to be fruitful. The project will also investigate analytic issues of network performance, in particular the use of derivatives and integrals of common network performance metrics like bandwidth and delay. <br/><br/>Broader Impact: This analysis will both assist in building control mechanisms for the project and generally increase the research community's understanding of network behaviors. The software and analytic tools developed by this project will be released to the research community.

By contrast, Raman spectroscopic analysis, which employs an optical signal, provides details of the material composition, akin to fingerprint identification. Although AFM and Raman information can be obtained independently by using two different instruments, the modular composite AFM/Raman system proposed here has the advantage of providing direct correlation between high-resolution visualization and Raman analysis of the spot (sample) of interest. It is hardly probable that the information at the mentioned scale could be achieved on the same sample spot with two different instruments. Furthermore, a key advantage is the use of the metallic tip of the AFM which enhances drastically the optical Raman signal received from a particular point on the sample. This state-of-the-art system will be used at the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) in various projects from material science, environmental science, and bioscience to industrial and economical applications such as investigations of pigments and biodiesel growth from microalgae. Most importantly, this sophisticated instrument will permit us to provide appropriate training in a cutting-edge field to current and future students of UTEP who are poised to become leading Hispanic students of tomorrow [UTEP is one of the leading Hispanic-Serving Institution and the only Doctoral Research Intensive institution from USA with a majority of Mexican-American students]. Thus, the multi-pronged approach proposed here will create a regional expertise through educational, research and job opportunities.<br/><br/>Technical abstract<br/>The proposed Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM)/confocal Raman modular composite system permits the simultaneous recording of AFM images, photoluminescence and Raman spectra. Consequently, a more comprehensive and detailed study of samples of interest can be undertaken leading to a better understanding of their physico-chemical properties. This is because not only topographical information, but also optical and structural information can be acquired without sample removal, resulting in no information loss for the spot of interest. Also, features such as an AFM metallic probe within the focus of the laser beam, the positioning of which can be tuned with nanometer precision, are expected to significantly enhance the photoluminescence and Raman signal. Thus, by taking advantage of a novel technique (Tip-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy, similar to the well known Surface-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy), this instrument facilitates investigations of structures at nano-scale. The spatial resolution of the instrument is at least two orders of magnitude better than the resolution of the traditional microprobe Raman; hence, structural information within the critical 10-100 nm domain can be obtained. The application of such instrumentation to both fundamental biophysical and applied nano-bio-technological research such as tagged quantum-dot reporters for probing unfolded states of biological macromolecules, the characterization of lipid transporting vesicles in the protozoan parasite Giardia lamblia, environmental issues such as soil and water remediation, and industrial applications such as investigations of pigments and biodiesel growth from microalgae will enhance many existing research projects and will also assist the development of new research directions at UTEP and the El Paso region. Last, but not least, the training of graduate students on this novel and state-of-the-art instrument will enhance our ability to educate, at a higher standard, the current and future generations of Hispanic scientists at the University of Texas at El Paso, one of the leading Hispanic-Serving Institution and the only Doctoral Research Intensive institution from USA with a majority of Mexican-American students.

Princeton	NJ	085442020	6092583090	SBE	1320, 1333	0000, OTHR	$0.00	This project develops new statistical tools for economists and other social scientists interested in studying individual behavior and outcomes over time. <br/><br/>The research is centered on two general scenarios. The first scenario involves situations in which a researcher is interested in the duration of some event. The tools developed in this part of the project will be useful in many areas of economics: in labor economics, to study the duration of unemployment; in public economics, to study participation in welfare programs; in marketing, to study the long-run effects of advertising; and in health economics, to study the evolution in health status. The innovation in these methods is that they will explicitly incorporate the possibility that one person's actions have an important impact upon the actions of others. For example, a teenager's decision to start smoking may be influenced by the smoking behavior of her friends and vice versa, or one family member's decision about how much to work may be effected by the decisions of the other family members. Such interactions imply that the effect of a policy that changes one person's behavior will be enlarged by the fact that that person's behavior will influence others. It is therefore important to have tools for measuring the importance of these interactions. <br/><br/>The other general scenario addressed in this research involves situations in which two outcomes interact with each other over time. For example, it is well-established that health and socioeconomic status are related. In interpreting such correlations, it is important to determine whether the correlation exists because a change in one of the two causes the other to change in the future (and, if so, which causes which), or because they are both determined by the same factor. The project develops general methods that can be used to answer such questions, and uses them to investigate the relationship between health and socioeconomic status in the US, as well as in a number of European countries. <br/><br/>Broader impacts: The most direct broader impact comes from the fact that software for the new statistical tools will be made available online, and from the training of the students involved in the project. The project will also improve the way economists and other social scientists think about their empirical findings.

Looking at the domain of spatial cognition, the proposed studies focus on whether and how language influences the way humans encode spatial relations in non-linguistic situations; the developmental trajectory of both acquisition of spatial language and spatial concepts; and the role of bilingualism in the acquisition and use of spatial concepts.<br/><br/>The study location harbors both monolingual Spanish and Tzotzil Maya speakers as well as a sizeable number of bilingual individuals. Compared to Spanish, Tzotzil Maya does not make use of relative (to the body) spatial references such as right and left. It has been proposed that such language differences will affect non-linguistic spatial cognition. However, the research findings are less than clear, in part due to the treatment of language as an independent variable. The current research overcomes some of the previous shortcomings both through a unique combination of ethnographic and experimental research, and a unique study site. In addition to focus on cross-language differences the study explores intra-group differences, exploring other potential factors that could account for differences in non-linguistic spatial reasoning. These differences are traced through the development. Research with children is supported through a unique setting, the Vanderbilt Chochom' Summer school. This summer school not only provides a large number of kids to be interviewed, but more importantly provides an ideal space within which children can be interviewed in a relaxed and natural setting.
0737849	Society of Wetland Scientists Minority Undergraduate Mentoring Program	DEB	ECOSYSTEM STUDIES	09/01/2007	08/15/2007	Frank Day	WI	Society of Wetland Scientists	Standard Grant	Henry L. Gholz	08/31/2011	$58,800.00		fday@odu.edu	22 N Carroll Street	Madison	WI	537032798	6083107855	BIO	1181	1181, 9169, EGCH	$0.00	The Society of Wetland Scientists (SWS) has established a minority undergraduate mentoring program associated with its annual meeting. The first four years of the program have been highly successful. This proposal seeks funding to support the participation of 7 undergraduate students per year from underrepresented groups in the mentoring program for an additional 4 years. SWS was established in 1980 to allow and promote the exchange of information related to wetlands. SWS is unique among scientific societies in that its members, from the academic, government, and private consulting sectors, represent a variety of perspectives on wetland science. The intellectual merit and broader impacts of the proposed activity are closely intertwined. SWS has devised a variety of strategies (symposia, social events, field trips, mentoring, follow-up) to ensure that award recipients will get maximum benefits out of their week-long SWS annual meeting experience and the mentoring they receive before and after the meeting.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: Attendance of a select group of undergraduate students from underrepresented groups at an annual scientific meeting provides each student with a perspective on and exposure to the breadth and depth of wetland science and personal contacts that cannot be obtained at a single academic home institution. The annual meeting of the Society includes concurrent sessions over four days, along with plenary and poster sessions. Because SWS spans academic, government, and private consulting sectors, individual students will be able to tailor their daily activities to their own personal interests in wetland science. By pairing undergraduate students with graduate student or faculty mentors at the annual meeting and by providing workshops and symposia oriented toward career development, SWS will foster active participation and discussion, each a key component of advancing science and promoting the intellectual development of undergraduate students.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: SWS recognizes the need to reach out to underrepresented groups to provide intellectual opportunities for personal growth and development. Attendance at a scientific meeting can often provide the intellectual spark, along with the opportunities to make contacts for the future, that encourage undergraduate students to continue their professional education beyond the Bachelor's degree. The goal is to use the mentoring program to open doors for undergraduate students in underrepresented groups. Each award recipient will be assigned a mentor, who will function in many ways, including as a personal bridge-builder, introducing each student to SWS members whose professional interests are in line with those of the undergraduate student.

The FIB/SEM will be utilized in projects that will develop nonvolatile memory devices and microfluidics-based biochemical sensors, environmentally sound aircraft coatings, innovative laser joining and deposition techniques, nanophase aluminum alloys via the friction-stir process, electrodeposited spintronic materials, chiral structures, and new techniques to analyze fluid inclusions and investigate two-phase and multi-phase nanofluidics. These projects represent only a fraction of the tasks that UMR faculty have proposed for the new instrumentation. Never before has the acquisition of a piece of equipment spurred such a high level of interest on our campus. Acquisition of this FIB/FESEM will not only enhance the capabilities and collaborations of research faculty on the UMR campus, but will benefit research being done throughout the State of Missouri. Other institutions that will benefit from the acquisition of this equipment include the Research Alliance of Missouri and the Missouri Nanoalliance, organizations dedicated to facilitating collaborative nanoscience research and facility development in the State of Missouri. The FIB/FESEM will allow graduate students working in many different materials and manufacturing research areas on campus to more fully and efficiently characterize thin films, interfaces, coatings, and many other applications. This state-of-the-art equipment will also enhance recruitment efforts at the undergraduate and graduate levels at UMR through programs such as the Opportunities for Undergraduate Research Experience (OURE). In addition, the instrument will be utilized to generate excitement among the K-12 students who participate in UMR's many pre-college programs. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Non-technical Abstract<br/><br/>Looking into the incredible world of nano-technology, 10,000 times smaller than the human hair, requires sophisticated equipment that can image many of the mysteries that escape the naked eye. Even better, being able to look beneath the surface of nano-structures and nano-materials reveals details otherwise lost. Combining the ability to both cut and image nanosystems, a focused ion beam / scanning electron microscope (FIB/SEM) enables engineers and scientists to investigate topics as wide ranging as synthetic bone replacements to semiconductor chips to stronger metals to environmentally friendly coatings that protect aircraft from corroding. Like ideas seen in Jurassic Park, where DNA is extracted from old fossils, the FIB/SEM can cut away the outer layers of centuries old biological samples and probe their characteristics to understand how they functioned. Unlocking the imagination of college students and researchers, the FIB/SEM at the University of Missouri-Rolla will be the first one of its kind in the state of Missouri, and will be utilized on numerous interdisciplinary projects between materials scientists, chemists, engineers, biologists and physicists. It will also reach out to the over 1,000 K-12 students that visit and tour the campus each year during field trips and summer camps in the hope to spark interest in the physical sciences for the next generation of scientists and engineers.

However, relatively little is known about the neural activity that supports these new ways of thinking. With NSF support, Dr. Susan Hespos of Northwestern University will examine the development of perceptual and cognitive processing in infancy through the use of near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). This technique, currently being implemented in a few laboratories around the world, allows the measurement of brain activation by means of the tiny amounts of light that pass through the skull. By amplifying this natural phenomenon, it is possible to measure brain activity safely and noninvasively, even with infants. NIRS will provide key information regarding the developmental trajectory of visual cognitive maturation. The localization of brain functions provided by NIRS will be verified by first testing the well-understood basic motor and sensory functions, and then moving on to more complicated issues regarding visual cognition. It is hoped that this progression will clarity the ambiguous results previous efforts have yielded on localization. The first of the extensions will be exploring the neural correlates of responding to familiar versus novel stimuli. Next, the neural development of object perception (discrimination of shapes, faces, size changes, orientation changes, categorization, etc.) will be studied. <br/><br/>Having a reliable and feasible method for studying the neural bases of behavior in infants will greatly facilitate the field of developmental cognitive neuroscience. This project will provide a new avenue for discovering developmental changes in brain activation during the first year of life. It has so far been difficult to study the neural correlates of higher-order cognitive processing in infants and how these interact with cognitive development. By mapping out the brain activity in typically developing infants, it will provide a baseline from which to examine individuals who are developing atypically. Clinical work on atypical development demonstrates that early diagnosis is generally of great benefit. Ultimately, NIRS imaging could be used for early diagnosis of language, motor, and/or visual disorders.

The project is building on the project-based learning literature and modern equipment to revise a biochemistry laboratory to meet the demands of today's biochemist. The revised integrated project-based laboratory approach is centered on a single protein (cytochrome c) from two different sources (bovine heart and baker's yeast). The first 8 weeks of the lab are being used to teach students biochemical methods and the control of variables by having them isolate and characterize cytochrome c. The last 6 weeks are providing a research-like experience by using student-designed projects that include developing testable hypotheses. The evaluation plan with its focus on student learning is providing data on the effectiveness of project-based and inquiry-based laboratories. The dissemination plan includes student poster sessions, student presentations at national meetings, and faculty professional development workshops. The broader impact of this project lies in (1) its contribution to problem-based learning and inquiry-based laboratories in biochemistry; (2) the promotion of student learning in basic and advanced biotechnological instrumentation for underrepresented students; (3) workshops for faculty professional development, and (4) a contribution to the departmental instrumentation infrastructure.
0716523	Collaborative Research: Evaluating student learning in geoscience curricula that employ conceptests using electronic student response systems	DUE	S-STEM:SCHLR SCI TECH ENG&MATH, CCLI-Type 2 (Expansion)	08/01/2007	08/02/2007	Jake Armour	NC	University of North Carolina at Charlotte	Standard Grant	Peter Lea	07/31/2012	$37,563.00		jarmour@uncc.edu	9201 University City Boulevard	CHARLOTTE	NC	282230001	7046871888	EHR	1536, 7492	9178, SMET	$0.00	Geology (42)<br/><br/><br/>We are exploring the impact of using electronic student response systems to facilitate learning in large introductory geoscience courses across the country. Students are provided a personally registered remote control that is used to answer conceptual questions during the actual class. The questions are text-, diagram- or graph-based multiple choice questions that focus on one key concept. They are intended to reinforce material presented in class. They provide immediate feedback to students as class responses are collected in near-real time and displayed on a graph at the front of the classroom. Students and instructors analyze the graphs, discuss the results and use that information to guide subsequent activities. Small group discussion of class responses is the primary mode of instruction. We are analyzing over 9000 student responses to identify questions that can be used as reliable in-class assessments at other institutions. Teaching and learning aids are also being developed to help students identify ways to better prepare for class so that they are successful in and out of class. We are varying the types of questions, amounts of response data students see and questioning techniques to determine which combinations provide the richest learning experiences. Data are being collected in six different states at community colleges, four-year colleges and research universities. The intellectual merit of this proposal includes analyses of data regarding the utility of using electronic response system and questions across populations, disciplines and educational settings and identification of better ways to ensure a scientifically literate population of non-science majors. The broader impact of this proposal includes the thorough study and documentation of student response to these questions by gender and ethnicity. Such documentation is leading to recommendations for how faculty can employ such assessments in the most inclusive way possible.

The bonding in molecules, particularly those involving carbon, could be described (and new molecules conceived) using rather simple concepts. Organic compounds are based on tetrahedral, trigonal, and linear digonal building blocks. Systems distorted from these ideal geometries are strained, according to the textbooks. Drastic deviations are too high in energy to exist.<br/><br/> Beginning in the1970''s, quantum chemical computations afforded opportunities to examine basically different bonding arrangements, such as those with carbon atoms in planar tetracoordinate environments. Computer predictions of such unconventional bonding led to numerous experimental verifications. The computational design of even more outlandish structures then led to the prediction of planar pentacoordinate, planar hexacoordinate, and even planar heptacoordinate carbon molecules! Possibilities for the computational exploration of molecules with many different types of unconventional structures abound. Examples involving extended systems with planar and nonplanar hypercoordinate carbons and other elements, novel sandwich structures including those with multiple layers and other extensions, with monolayer metal atom sheets, and those comprised of cage molecules are among those suggested in the proposal. <br/> The anticipated impact may be considerable. While truly new compositions of matter cannot have any immediate use, such uses often develop later based on the unusual properties which often accompany unusual bonding. The immediate impact is the realization that the chemical bonding principles long held to be inviolate can be extended and can reveal new worlds of chemical structures.<br/><br/> These projects are particularly instructive to undergraduates and to graduate students, since they demonstrate how fundamental chemical research can be carried out with computers (which involves far more than black box applications) and illustrates how imaginative, rule-breaking research lines can developed intellectually. Representative examples are included in graduate courses given by the senior personnel, and these courses also feature hands-on exercises such as the computation of planar tetracoordinate methane.

The current project is focused on refining, expanding, and testing these education innovations on a wider audience of faculty and students across the United States. It is also implementing the new materials, and in the process, creating diverse and portable modules for student projects and undergraduate research. More precisely, the project is developing faculty expertise by conducting workshops at the PI home institutions and at national meetings to train faculty to teach the course at their home institutions. Also, the PIs are recruiting participants from these workshops to develop project modules to be used by students as end of term projects or in undergraduate research. Moreover, the PIs are institutionalizing the course at their schools and are providing assistance to other interested institutions. The PIs are managing the development of a growing and self-sustaining network of faculty educators who teach and institutionalize the course, develop modules, and participate in the assessment of the role of the course in the curriculum.

In an effort to develop a collaborative-from-the-start educational neuroscience, the PIs are addressing this question in the context of mathematics learning. By the age of twelve, children have nearly adult levels of fluency at comparing natural numbers. Child behavioral data and adult fMRI and behavioral data indicate that these comparisons depend on neurological processes that also compare perceptual magnitudes. Around this same age, children are introduced to the integers, which build upon, but go beyond, the natural numbers. The PIs' initial behavioral data indicate that children initially understand negative numbers by applying rules. For example, to determine the larger of a negative and a positive digit, they simply note which one has the negative sign. In contrast, the adult behavioral data exhibit the signature of a perceptual phenomenon known as categorical perception, such that zero has become an important boundary for making comparisons. Using a combination of fMRI, developmental, and instructional data, the PIs are testing whether the long-term combination of rules and the well-known natural numbers evolves into a representation of integers that partakes of perceptual processes. If so, this will provide a model instance of how educational neuroscience can contribute novel theories to education and neuroscience. For example, common wisdom has it that abstract rules arise from perceptual representations, but if the PIs' hypothesis is true, then the development of integer understanding is an instance where perception-like representations arise from the application of abstract rules.

While the causes of the extinction event are debated and of intense interest, the effect of the ensuing community changes on species that survived the extinction has not been well investigated. Yet knowledge about effects on survivors will be immensely valuable to predictions of future biodiversity. Thus, instead of studying the Pleistocene extinction solely from the perspective of why species went extinct, PIs are keen to investigate how, or in fact, whether, surviving species were affected by the extinction event. PIs therefore propose to use the rich but untapped Quaternary fossil resources of Shasta County, California, to investigate the response of the mammal species that survived the Pleistocene-Holocene transition event. Their primary goal is to determine community, species, and population response of survivors to the Pleistocene-Holocene transition and to sort out whether the response was due to megafaunal extinction, climatic change or both. To document the nature of late Quaternary disturbance events and impacts on the biota, they will use an interdisciplinary approach, based on tracing changes in morphometrics, isotopes, genetics, and community composition of fossil mammals. This will be facilitated by (i) excavations and analyses of newly discovered and known fossil sites; (ii) obtaining secure stratigraphic control with multiple radiocarbon dates and other geochronologic and stratigraphic techniques; (iii) conducting genetic analyses aimed at detecting signs of population subdivision, density changes and local extirpation; (iv) comparison of pre- and post-extinction communities in terms of taxonomic composition, total species richness, species richness within various size and trophic categories, abundance and evenness of species; (v) tracing phenotypic changes in populations; and (vi) using ancient DNA with phylochronologic techniques to directly recognize genetic structuring of fossil populations. All of the biotic changes will be interpreted within the framework of the extensive extinction and climatic changes that are documented in their study area and globally.

A common thread<br/>running through these problems is the following mathematical<br/>structure: a non-convex potential energy in the lower-order<br/>terms, which includes the loading, in addition to a small,<br/>higher-order regularization (or singular perturbation),<br/>characterized by a small parameter e > 0.  The main goals of this<br/>work are: (1) to provide classes of rational models --<br/>particularly in the case of multi-phase lipid-bilayer membranes<br/>-- for understanding the often exotic behavior of such<br/>structures; (2) to systematically find equilibria corresponding<br/>to local minima of the total potential energy or meta-stable<br/>solutions.  In addressing (1), observe that mechanical<br/>experiments on real materials often begin with a homogeneous<br/>specimen that progressively develops increasingly complex<br/>patterns or micro-structure under steady, quasi-static changes in<br/>loading.  The investigator employs rational continuum models,<br/>characterized by general constitutive functions, and looks for<br/>thresholds of bifurcation and exchange of stability to compare<br/>with experiment.  In particular, meta-stable solutions are the<br/>ones presumably observed in quasi-static experiments. <br/>Accordingly for (2) he considers a new methodology based upon:<br/>(a) rigorous existence of solutions for arbitrarily small e > 0<br/>via symmetry-breaking global bifurcation methods and a-priori<br/>bounds; (b) efficient and reliable global numerical<br/>path-following to find meta-stable states. <br/><br/>     The project focuses on fundamental modeling and predictive<br/>mathematical analysis for the quantitative characterization of<br/>shape and deformation patterns of certain micron-scale structures<br/>under applied loading, namely, lipid-bilayer membrane vesicles,<br/>shape-memory alloys and thin films.  Each of these has direct and<br/>important connections to basic science and technology. <br/>Lipid-bilayer membranes are ubiquitous in bio-molecular systems;<br/>understanding and predicting their mechanical behavior is crucial<br/>for understanding cell function.  The project focuses on simple,<br/>man-made membranes or liposomes.  The future promise of liposome<br/>vesicles (closed membranes) as vehicles for drug delivery demands<br/>a fundamental understanding of their mechanical behavior under<br/>loading.  Likewise for phase transitions in shape-memory alloys<br/>and wrinkling/blistering of thin films -- a fundamental<br/>understanding and the mathematical prediction of their behavior<br/>are important for characterizing the mechanical properties of<br/>novel materials and for potential sensing and actuation at the<br/>micron scale.<br/>

Typically, one simulates network hardware and software in software using, for example, the widely used ns-2 simulator. Experimentation proceeds by simulating the use of the network by a given population of users using applications such as ftp or web browsers. Synthetic workload generators are used to inject data into the network according to a model of how the applications or users behave.<br/><br/>In order to perform realistic network simulations, one needs a traffic generator that is capable of generating realistic synthetic traffic in a closed-loop fashion that ?looks like? traffic found on an actual network. Unfortunately, the networking community suffers from a lack of validated tools and models suitable for synthetic traffic generation. As a result, all too often, networking technology is evaluated using ad hoc workloads with an unknown relationship to traffic seen on real links and hence begs the question of how believable the results of the evaluation are.<br/><br/>This project is a collaborative effort to develop a synthetic traffic generation resource for the experimental networking research community. The resource consists of (1) synthetic traffic generators for the ns-2, ns-3, and GTNets software simulators, and Linux and BSD-based testbeds, (2) a repository of datasets to be used by the traffic generators to generate traffic that is statistically equivalent to traffic found on a variety of network links including campus networks, wide-area backbone networks, corporate intranets, wireless networks, etc, and (3) a set of traffic analysis tools to enable researchers to generate empirical models of traffic on network links of interest and to use these models to drive the synthetic traffic generation process.

Genetically modified plants for biofuel production: biodiesel production<br/> from Crambe <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: This proposed experimental facility will have a strong impact on the local environment at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst at several levels. It will serve as a focal point for several research projects and enable collaborative research that is interdisciplinary and timely. The proposed equipment will represent the cornerstone of a leading biofuel laboratory in the United States, enhancing our ability to recruit and retain superior graduate students and faculty. Graduate students from underrepresented groups will be recruited in collaboration with established outreach programs at University of Massachusetts. This facility will increase funding from the private sector, and we are currently working with several companies to commercialize a number of biofuel related technologies. The requested instruments will positively impact education in two ways. A centralized facility will be utilized by a multi-disciplinary group of faculty and students at the graduate and undergraduate levels, providing an ideal learning environment for integrating research with education. The initial estimates indicate that at least 17 graduate and undergraduate students will be heavy equipment users, with additional student researchers expected as they advertise the facility across the campus. Secondly, the catalytic reactor and fermentation equipment will be integrated into two senior-level laboratory courses offered by the Chemical Engineering Department. The team will encourage other departments to develop similar laboratory course experiments. The proposed research and teaching activities will facilitate the development of renewable liquid transportation fuels from plant biomass, thus alleviating problems (global warming, political instability, etc.) caused by national dependence on fossil fuels.

The project's novelty is its specific focus on automated reasoning where the relevant information is a combination of certain (deterministic) and uncertain (probabilistic) information. The need to accommodate both types of information is motivated by many real world problems such as scheduling of operating rooms and the diagnosing the nature of a disease, where situation assessment, planning or decision-making often involve taking into consideration both hard constraints and probabilistic information. A unique aspect of the project is that its algorithms will be founded upon a single theoretical framework--AND/OR search, developed by the investigator--which is driven by the graphical representation of the problems and often results in exponentially reduced complexities. The guiding principle behind the algorithms is the exploitation of useful structural features of a given problem instance, such as decomposability, sub-problem equivalence, and sub-problem irrelevance. The work proposed here promises to enhance problem-solving knowledge not just in the field of artificial intelligence, but also in the scientific community in general. As they are completed, the new algorithms will be posted on a publicly available Web site.

It will pursue specific aspects of this goal by conducting detailed studies of teaching and learning in the context of innovative curricula that focus on developing visual models. We lack studies that bring together insights on models and visualization from cognitive science and strategic planning for model based learning in real classroom interactions. The project will concentrate on methods teachers use to guide full class discussions while using innovative model-based curricula in middle school biology and in high school physical science. The three major parallel tracks of the research are:<br/> I: Documenting student imagistic reasoning processes in discussion.<br/> II: Identifying classroom teaching strategies that foster the learning of visual models.<br/> III: Identifying specific visual modeling strategies (e.g., the use of animations and simulations in small tutoring groups and in full classrooms)<br/><br/>The project responds to the need to describe guided inquiry methods that lie between pure discovery and pure lecture approaches. Overall, the project will contribute to connecting three important areas of theory: the cognitive dynamics of imagistic mental simulation; the dynamics of teacher-student co-construction in full class discussions; and theories of model-based learning for conceptual change. These theoretical results will contribute to the practice of pedagogy by providing a more coherent framework within which teachers and other educators can make informed decisions about classroom strategies and pedagogical tools such as animations and simulations.

The basic idea of IS to simulate the system under a different probability distribution, and correct for biasedness via the likelihood ratio. During the last three decades, most of the IS schemes that were developed were based on heuristics, and led to algorithms with questionable performance. In contrast, this research project develops a systematic methodology for the construction of simple, efficient IS schemes for broad classes of process models. This approach capitalizes on the intimate connection between IS and a related differential game. It turns out that subsolutions to the Isaacs equation associated with the game can be used to build IS schemes whose performance can be rigorously characterized. The investigators are particularly interested in developing both theoretical and practical aspects of importance sampling in the areas of stochastic networks, metastability analysis, systems with discontinuous dynamics, small noise diffusions, counting problems, analysis of higher-order moments of IS estimators, and heavy-tailed distributions. The project will also study the use of subsolutions for the construction and analysis of fast simulation methods based on branching processes, such as splitting and RESTART.<br/><br/>Rare events, such as transitions between stable wells in a model from chemical physics, data loss in a highly reliable communication system, or unexpectedly large payouts in insurance claims, are often key quantitative measures of a system's overall behavior. They also play a central role in risk assessment and management. Reliable numerical methods are required in order to design systems and protocols that can minimize and mitigate the negative effects of rare events. The main technique for the fast simulation of rare events is importance sampling. Importance sampling algorithms have been developed over the last thirty years for many different application areas. However, the development to date has been largely ad hoc and without a proper theoretical foundation. Practitioners have relied on a few rudimentary heuristics in constructing importance sampling algorithms. The performance of these schemes was supported by limited numerical evidence, and unfortunately recent work has shown that these heuristics are in general unreliable. This project brings new ideas from probability theory and tools from game theory and partial differential equations to the problem of design and analysis of importance sampling schemes. The work aims to develop systematic methods for the construction and rigorous analysis of reliable algorithms.

The approach is to integrate two promising tools, the probabilistic collocation method and trajectory sensitivity-based methods. These tools permit the selection of a sparse set of simulations from which a mapping between uncertain parameters and the output(s) of interest can be found. The mappings can be used to study the effects of critical uncertainties, and to tune parameters to mitigate those effects. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit:<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of the project lies in the study of methodologies that permit uncertainty evaluation for large dynamic models of electric power systems. The project will develop techniques for selecting a sparse set of simulations that enable performance evaluation over the domain of possible parameter values. Investigations of trajectory sensitivities will seek to establish a fundamental understanding of the influence of dynamic models on uncertainty propagation. Insights into the role played by the network structure will be provided, and tools that exploit that structure developed. <br/><br/>Broader Impact:<br/><br/>Utilities use simulation-based evaluation of system behavior to make decisions that have tremendous economic and reliability implications. The parameters of many models are, however, quite uncertain. The techniques developed in this project will allow efficient assessment of such uncertainty. The risk of large disturbances will be reduced accordingly. Given the wide applicability of the developed methods to general large-scale systems, the project will stimulate diverse educational opportunities including courses on the graduate level and undergraduate capstone design. Efforts for recruiting students from underrepresented groups including students from the University of Puerto Rico-Mayaguez will increase diversity at the home institutions end ultimately contribute to a more diverse engineering workforce.

Herman of Tulane University is supported by the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to continue work in designing accurate semiclassical methods to study complex systems undergoing quantum transitions. These methods are improving the numerical efficiency of semiclassical schemes, which is allowing them to be applied to more realistic physical systems. Developments underway include extending the family of surface hopping methods by providing a solid theoretical basis for their implementation, developing an Initial Value Representation (IVR) based on classical molecular dynamics, and delineating a hierarchy of approximations to create opportunities for applications to a broad range of problems. These methods will allow studies of more larger and more complex systems with greater accuracy, efficiency and reliability. Applications include models of the relaxation of vibrational energy of molecules in liquids, and electron transfer from a donor system to an acceptor system in the condensed phase. This work is having a broader impact in training undergraduates, graduate students and postdoctoral associates in chemical physics theory and computational methods. The methods developed in this work are providing versatile tools that will find application in a variety of fields.

A model of cognitive processes exists as a computer program for simple knowledge-based problem solving using a highly parallel architecture with components for processing goals, plans, memory and perception. In order to extend this model it will be necessary to extend its various components to incorporate new types of knowledge that are to be used creatively and to introduce new mechanisms for conceptual representations and their manipulation. The new method of representing knowledge allows knowledge to be flexibly abstracted or constrained as required to discover new problem solutions. The highly parallel nature of the existing model will allow many different kinds of knowledge to be activated concurrently thereby allowing a large set of potential solutions to be considered, but it will also allow a large set of constraints to be applied concurrently to find the best solutions.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of the project will be in advancing our understanding of the important area of creativity by showing how different knowledge-based processes work together to creatively solve problems. Its broader impact will be in showing how to develop systems which support and enhance human creativity in the design of commercial products, in artistic and cultural activities, in understanding the development of creativity in our children, in educating our students to be more creative, and to have marketable creative skills.

Neal Tate and Rodelio Manacsa<br/><br/>Title: Doctoral Dissertation Research: Gavels Defying Guns: The Judicial Control of State Power in Post-Authoritarian Polities<br/><br/>0720099<br/><br/>Abstract<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this proposal emerges from its multimethod, data-based approach to investigating a puzzle of great theoretical and policy significance: When do gavels defy guns? When do judges invalidate actions of government? In doing so, it can make a major contribution to theories of democracy and authoritarianism and to policy-relevant knowledge. That judges are or should be able to defy rulers is one of the foundational assumptions of efforts to promote democracy and the rule of law. Yet rulers can refuse to implement judicial rulings, cut the court's jurisdiction, reduce the budget allotted to the court, and impeach the magistrates to bend the gavel to their will. These threats are particularly compelling in new or re-established democracies where judges do not enjoy the institutional safeguards or the popular support that protect their counterparts in more developed polities. Our understanding of when and how judges do defy rulers is underdeveloped. This proposal develop a theoretical framework that uses contextual, attitudinal, and legal variables to account for when and why judges try to limit the exercise of governmental power, applying the framework to the Supreme Courts of the Philippines and South Africa. Statistical analyses of the decision making of these courts during periods of authoritarianism and transitions to democracy will be supplemented by field research and interviews with Philippine and South African judges to construct a culturally grounded and parsimonious model of judicial control. The broader impact of this study is evident in the contribution it can make to promoting a better intellectual understanding of the role of courts and judges in democratization and establishing the rule of law the potential contribution it can make to efforts by policy makers to promote more democratic and lawful governments. Completing the research proposed will also build the infrastructure of scholars who come from and understand the struggles of democratizing nations recovering from authoritarianism.

XPS is the most intensively employed technique in the multi-user center, accounting for 20% of instrument use by more than 100 academic users each year. However, the available XPS system is the oldest of all instruments in the center (it is 20 years old!) and lacks important capabilities. The replacement we propose, the PHI 5000 VersaProbe, takes the technique of XPS to the next level. It can focus the analyzing X-rays to a highly intense local probe with a diameter less than 10 um and raster it over the specimen surface. Combined with the shallow depth to which XPS probes below the surface, this will enable local chemical analysis of very small volumes of material and elemental mapping with high lateral resolution. The instrument is equipped with an electron energy analyzer optimized for energy resolution and high-angle acceptance. This will enable high-performance micro-area spectroscopy, high-sensitivity large-area spectroscopy, secondary electron imaging, and high-performance sputter depth profiling. In addition, the proposed instrument includes a system for hands-off charge neutralization, which will greatly facilitate the analysis of non-conducting specimens. These capabilities are much in demand by the center's users and will enable major advances in many areas of materials research, including the development of (i) a novel gas-phase carburization process that makes the surfaces of structural alloys (e.g. stainless steel) ultra-hard and much more corrosion-resistant by introducing a colossal supersaturation of interstitial solutes, (ii) novel catalyst nanoparticles for less expensive and more efficient PEM-based fuel cells, (iii) diamond-based electrodes for biomedical applications, and (iv) a micro-fabrication-based, flexible electrode-array platform technology for neural recording and stimulation sensors. Corresponding to its broad range of applications, the new instrument will play an important role in the education and training of graduate students and postdoctoral researchers at Case.<br/><br/><br/>Non-Technical Abstract<br/><br/>The Swagelok Center for Surface Analysis of Materials at Case Western Reserve University requests NSF funds for a state-of-the-art instrument for analyzing the chemical composition of the surface and near-surface regions - the topmost 2 to 3 layers of atoms - of diverse materials. Inasmuch as the surface is where materials interact with their environment, this capability is of central importance for developing new materials with superior properties. A well-established and very powerful method for surface analysis is X-ray photoelectron spectrometry: Irradiating the surface of the material with soft, low-energy X-rays in vacuum causes atoms in the first few layers directly below the surface to give off electrons (the photoelectric effect), and by measuring the energy of these charged particles, the chemical identity of the atoms that emitted them can be determined. Not surprisingly, X-ray photoelectron spectrometry is the most intensively employed technique in the Swagelok Center. However, the available system is the oldest instrument in the center (it is 20 years old!) and lacks important capabilities. The replacement we propose takes the technique to the next level. Most importantly, it can focus the analyzing X-rays to a small spot and move it across the specimen surface. Combined with the shallow depth to which X-ray photoelectron spectrometry probes the material, local chemical analysis of very small volumes of material will be possible, as well as mapping variations in chemical composition across the specimen surface with high accuracy. Moreover, the proposed instrument can efficiently analyze the composition at considerable depths below the surface by successively removing thin layers of material from a small surface region and analyzing the surface composition of the freshly exposed material. These abilities are much in demand by many of the more than 100 materials researchers using the Swagelok Center each year. The new instrument will enable progress in many important areas of materials research, including the development of (i) a novel process that makes the surface of alloys (e.g. stainless steel) ultra-hard and much more corrosion-resistant, providing tremendous energy-savings by extending the lifetime of metal parts in many technical applications, (ii) novel catalyst nanoparticles for less expensive and more efficient portable fuel cells - devices that convert the chemical energy contained in a fuel (e.g. alcohol) directly to electricity, (iii) novel diamond electrodes for diverse biomedical applications, and (iv) novel microelectrode arrays for contacting nerves to electronic devices. Corresponding to its broad range of applications, the new instrument will play an important role in the education and training of graduate students and postdoctoral researchers at Case.

This project addresses two grand challenges-Cutting-edge STEM Content and K-12 Science Assessments. Using DNA Sequencing Analysis Program (DSAP) that will be modified by the proposed project, high school students and teachers will learn molecular biology and modern genetics by working with authentic genomic sequences, and submit their findings for review by scientists. The objective of this project is to develop state-of-the-art web-based tools and resources that will make it possible for high school students to conduct authentic research in bioinformatics. To accomplish this objective the project will employ the following methods: First scientists from Rutgers University Waksman Institute will team with educators from WestEd, a nonprofit research, development and service agency, to produce an online embedded assessment tool that will be used to provide feedback about student understanding of molecular biology, bioinformatics, and related subjects. The project will also take advantage of experienced high school teachers in this regard. Secondly, the DSAP tool (consisting of five separate yet interrelated components: (1) a student DNA sequence analysis scaffolding program; (2) an administrative program that allows teachers to view student work, students to evaluate peers, and teachers to communicate with their students; (3) a staff administrative program that allows the researchers to observe student and teacher work, and interact with both groups; (4) an embedded assessment tool that will monitor and measure student learning; (5) a series of tutorials and help modules that will guide students through their DNA sequence analysis. Thirdly, over a four-year period the DSAP tool will be field-tested, revised, piloted, and disseminated guided by formative assessment, project evaluation, and teacher/student feedback. These programs will be designed to be used in two settings: locally, with teachers and students who attend a summer institute at Rutgers University, and remotely, with teachers and students over the Internet.

Yet obtaining high quality representative measurements remains a daunting task, requiring expertise and professional connections that relatively few possess. The goal of this research is to explore an approach for providing diverse, representative, and easily accessible on-demand Internet measurements. Specifically, the approach in this project involves designing, prototyping, and studying a system named DipZoom (for ?Deep Internet Performance Zoom-in?), which is based on two key ideas. First, recognizing the difficulty any single provider would face in building a platform representative of the scale and diversity of the Internet, DipZoom implements a matchmaking service instead, using P2P concepts to bring together experimenters in need of measurements with external measurement providers. Thus, DipZoom leverages experimenters themselves in deploying a large number and variety of measuring points. Second, DipZoom provides a unified view over the entire network of measurement providers, which is accessible and controllable from a participant?s local machine. By removing the need to recruit and interact with individual measuring probes, DipZoom should drastically lower the barrier of entry for conducting quality Internet performance research. The intellectual merit of this project lies in the above ideas and in a number of new concepts and techniques these ideas entail, such as ranking of measurement providers, selective calibration of measuring hosts, selection of measuring hosts for a given measurement, identification of potential attacks and development of countermeasures, and so on. <br/><br/>The broader impact includes making high-quality network measurements accessible to a wide technical community, and enhancing undergraduate education in computer networks by allowing networking courses to incorporate complex network measurement experiments.

Peterson of Washington State University is supported by the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program and the Office of International Science and Engineering for research and education in collaboration with Hans-Joachim Werner of Stuttgart University. The PIs propose to develop and implement innovative methods to determine accurate thermochemical properties for molecules containing heavy p-block elements. This will be accomplished by using newly developed explicitly correlated methods. These will include scalar and spin-orbit relativistic effects, local correlation methods, and analytical gradients. New, systematically convergent basis sets for the methods with relativistic core potentials will also be developed. This work is having a broader impact in that the methods developed will be made available to the community via the MOLPRO package. Students and postdoctoral associates will be trained in programming and advanced electronic structure methods, and will have the opportunity for international experience in research. The synergistic nature on the international research collaboration requires close interaction of the partners in the development of highly correlated methods in concert with innovative basis sets.

To achieve this, the research is organized into four components: (1) to develop and validate a scientific theory that account for the interaction between electrochemical reactions and mechanical stresses in ionic solids, (2) to develop a numerical method for solving the nonlinear equations in the new theory, (3) to gain better understanding of the coupling between electrochemistry and thermomechanical stresses in ionic solids near microscopic defects such as voids and crack, and (4) to conduct experimental validation of the new theory.<br/>Ionic solids such as yttria-stabilized zirconia and gadolinium-doped ceria are commonly used to make electrolyte - a key component in solid oxide fuel cells. Solid oxide fuel cell is an electrochemical device that converts hydrogen into electricity without releasing harmful pollution. It is considered as one of the most promising green energy conversion technologies of the future. However, to make solid oxide fuel cell commercially variable, fracture failure of the electrolyte under combined mechanical and electrochemical loadings must be fully understood. This research is to meet such need. Besides contributing to science and engineering, the research activities will also have a broader impact on educating students. Key aspects of the educational plan include integrating research results into existing courses, involving undergraduates in engineering research, bridging graduate research across different disciplines, and engaging students from underrepresented groups in engineering research.
0642532	Collaborative Research: Multisensory Influences On Touch Perception--fMRI, MEG and TMS Studies	BCS	COGNEURO	09/01/2007	06/03/2009	Michael Beauchamp	TX	University of Texas Health Science Center Houston	Continuing grant	Lynne Bernstein	08/31/2011	$427,560.00		michael.beauchamp@bcm.edu	7000 FANNIN ST	HOUSTON	TX	770305400	7135003999	SBE	1699	0000, 1699, OTHR	$0.00	In our everyday lives, we are frequently confronted with information from multiple sensory modalities. Recently, there has been increasing interest in the circumstances under which stimuli presented in one sensory modality influence sensations in a different modality. For instance, the sound of a mosquito buzzing seemingly enhances sensitivity to touch (tactile stimulation) on our skin; seeing an insect crawling on someone else's arm seems to affect our own tactile perception. Despite several recent studies examining the influence of audition and vision on touch, the brain mechanisms responsible for these interactions are poorly understood. An NSF-funded collaborative effort of Tony Ro (Rice University) and Michael Beauchamp (University of Texas Health Science Center, Houston) will use a combination of converging methods to examine tactile processing in isolation and the influence of vision and audition on touch in the human brain. Psychophysical studies will be conducted to determine the optimal stimulus parameters that demonstrate an influence of vision and audition on tactile perception. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and magnetoencephalography (MEG) will be used to localize the brain regions involved with integrating multisensory information. While most of these experiments will be conducted using normal controls, an additional series of experiments will be conducted in a unique patient who acquired auditory-tactile synesthesia following a stroke. Tactile sensitivity on the patient's left hand and arm was impaired, but he now feels tactile sensations in that area in response to sounds. Psychophysical and imaging experiment will be completed on this patient to determine the neural mechanisms responsible for the synesthesia, especially whether plastic neural changes have reconstituted the patient's somatosensory cortex so that it is now responds to sounds. <br/><br/>These studies will not only better our understanding of multisensory integration, but will provide a deeper appreciation of general information processing mechanisms of the human brain. Such knowledge will contribute towards the development of better rehabilitative tools for patients with congenital or acquired sensory deficits to one or more of the sensory systems. Additionally, this research will provide a better understanding of the mechanisms of natural and brain-damaged induced changes that take place in the adult human brain. The funding will be used to support research training opportunities for undergraduate, graduate, and post-doctoral trainees in cognitive neuroscience and brain imaging in the Houston area. In addition to training the next generation of brain scientists, the findings of this research will be disseminated through scientific and lay publications, as well as other media outlets, allowing for a deeper understanding and appreciation of the human brain in society.

These fluorescent conjugated polymeric materials are important in a number of electronic devices, and show promise in a number of technological applications. Prof. Peteanu and her group, working with a number of collaborators will bring to bear a number of powerful tools -- including electronic structure calculations with David Yaron (Carnegie -Mellon), THz absorption spectroscopy measurements with Ted Heilweil (NIST-Gaithersburg), X-ray scattering with Stephanie Tristram-Nagle (Carnegie-Mellon), and a number of microscopic and spectroscopic methods in her own lab -- to study the fundamental physical processes occurring in these materials. The ultimate goal of these studies is to develop a better understanding of the microscopic physical and chemical processes occurring in these materials, with an eye towards developing materials with improved properties.<br/><br/>Organic electronic materials show great promise for a number of electronic and photo-physical applications including flat-screen displays, organic transistors, and photocells. An improved understanding of the fundamental photophysics taking place in these materials will likely lead to improved materials for these various devices. Providing this improved understanding is one of the main goals of the research carried out in studies like the one funded in this award. In addition to the broader societal impact that these improved materials will have, the students trained in this project will be broadly educated in a number of disciplines including materials science, physics and chemistry.

While most invasion research has focused on aboveground organisms (plants, animals), invasions in the soil can be equally important. Foreign earthworm species are currently invading North American forests over a wide geographic area and are causing marked changes in the soil environment. Previous NSF-funded research in two forested landscapes in New York State demonstrated that earthworm invasions had striking but complex effects on forest soils, altering the structure of soil profiles, and changing the dynamics of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus. This renewal project will address how earthworm invasions affect carbon and nitrogen dynamics by altering the soil food web. Stable isotopes (13C and 15N) will be used to explore how the flow of carbon and nitrogen through different soil components is related to shifts in soil food web structure as well as to flows into the above-ground food web via woodland salamander populations. The research will be coupled with formal and non-formal K-12 education and outreach efforts, based on the idea that earthworm ecology is a powerful tool for engaging a broad diversity of people in thinking about soils and ecosystems.

The roadblock to developing such materials is our lack of understanding.  In this project recently invented scanned probe microscopes will be used to create images of electrons moving in plastic circuits and in solar cells.  The information will be used to guide synthetic chemists to make improved materials. State-of-the-art variable-temperature vacuum electric force microscopy will be used to probe charge injection and trapping in organic electronic devices, and the local charge mobility in an organic thin-film device will be imaged via a new scanned probe technique that detects local electric field fluctuations.  The results will broadly impact our thinking about organic electronic materials, with application to light emitting diodes and organic solar cell technology.  This project represents a unique opportunity to train graduate students in the arts of advanced scanned probe microscopy and nanofabrication, two skills that appear to be in ever-increasing demand.  In order to assure the broadest possible interdisciplinary training in materials research, students on this project will work on collaborative summer projects with scientists at federal and industrial laboratories.<br/><br/>%%%<br/><br/>The goal of this proposal is to help discover and invent new materials for making more efficient solar cells and more cost effective plastic circuits.  Inventing improved solar cells is crucial because our country needs to develop better, more renewable sources of energy.  If plastic circuits could be developed it would lead to new methods of high interest to industry, e.g., for tracking products and interfacing with medical sensors.  Existing materials are simply not up to these tasks.  Students trained in this area will be highly competitive in the job market.<br/><br/>

Powell, supervised by Dr. Dorothy C. Holland, will undertake research on the social consequences of the pursuit of alternative energy development on the Navajo Reservation. The research will focus on four primary research areas, determined in the researcher''s preliminary work to be salient areas for comparison between older and newer energy technologies. The four research areas are: social and economic networks; production scales; cultural significance; and temporal framing (particularly, trade-offs between present and future).<br/><br/>She will employ a multi-method research strategy. Her methodologies will include semi-structured interviews; life history narratives from key figures in the recent history of reservation energy development; participant observation; and content analysis of archival and public documents. <br/><br/>The research is important because few studies have examined the contingencies of development in the context of contemporary Native America or explored how development projects generate new identities, knowledges, and historically particular claims on the future. The proposed project explores this largely understudied geographic and conceptual domain, within the context of mounting global concern over the future of energy technologies. The research also will contribute significantly to the education of a social scientist.
0728519	IRES: Research Opportunities in Extensional Dynamics for US Undergraduate and Graduate Geosciences Students in Western Turkey	OISE	TECTONICS, EDUCATION AND HUMAN RESOURCES, EAPSI	01/01/2008	08/08/2007	Elizabeth Catlos	OK	Oklahoma State University	Standard Grant	Osman Shinaishin	05/31/2009	$150,000.00	Ibrahim Cemen, Estella Atekwana	ejcatlos@gmail.com	101 WHITEHURST HALL	Stillwater	OK	740781011	4057449995	O/D	1572, 1575, 7316	1304, 5940, 5976, 7639, 9150, EGCH	$0.00	0728519<br/>Catlos<br/><br/>The project is to support an IRES for US-Turkey Collaboration on the extensional dynamics for U.S. undergraduate and graduate geosciences students in Western Turkey. The US PIs are Dr. Elizabeth Catlos, Dr. Estella Atekwana and Dr. Ibrahim Cemen, Department of Geology, Oklahoma State University (OSU), Stillwater, Oklahoma. The foreign collaborators are Dr. Cemal Goncuoglu, Middle East Technical University (METU) in Ankara and Dr. Mete Hancer, Pamukkale University, Denizli, Turkey. Since 2005, the PI has been conducting NSF-supported research in western Turkey in collaboration with co-PI Cemen and with Dr. Cemal Goncuoglu at Middle East Technical University and Dr. Mete Hancer, Pamukkale University. The collaborative efforts have centered on field and geochemical studies of the Menderes Massif in western Turkey. Two Master's level graduate students from OSU have participated in the project and have conducted intensive field work and training in Turkey. In this project the PIs will take advantage of ongoing research activities and the expertise of a new OSU faculty member (Atekwana) to provide research and training opportunities for 9 US students (6 undergraduates and 3 graduate students). The proposal will focus on the teaching and training of students that are traditionally underrepresented in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) fields. Over three years, these students will partner with peers at METU and Pamukkale University to conduct field-based research within a multidisciplinary framework focused on investigating the dynamics of extension within the Earth's lithosphere. The goal is to provide talented and motivated US students with hands-on field experience in geophysical surveying, field mapping, GPS mapping, sampling, as well as the tools necessary to make geochemical and petrologic observations. <br/>Intellectual merits: The scientific focus of this proposal is to develop a better understanding of the creation and evolution of the planet's largest metamorphic core complex, the Menderes Massif. The mechanism(s) that created extension in this region, and, consequently, how the Menderes Massif relates to other extensional domains in the Aegean Region is unclear. The tectonic history of this large and fundamental component of the Aegean is important, as it lends considerable insight into the large-scale processes that control and facilitate extension of the Earth's lithosphere. Proposed models for the creation of the massif include subduction roll-back, orogenic collapse, and extrusiontectonics. These concepts are often discussed in a variety of Geoscience courses. The topic of lithospheric extension is also a subject of current investigation and active discussion by numerous researchers in the field and laboratory as evidenced by recent NSF and Geological Society of America workshops.<br/>Broader Impacts: This project integrates field and geochemical research activities into the education of OSU undergraduate and graduate students. The proposal is geared towards students who are underrepresented in the Physical Sciences. The PI will partner with researchers and educators in OSU's relevant diversity offices to recruit and fund students. The project will provide access and support for the OSU Electron Microprobe and the UCLA Ion Microprobe Laboratory. The OSU and UCLA labs are sites of research and mentoring for a large number of students. Students will be encouraged to present the results of their research at professional meetings, including those geared towards advancing minority participation. With the Middle East likely to become one of the most crucial regional arenas for U.S. foreign policy in the coming years, and with Turkey singled out as a key country where the training pipeline should be expanded at every level, this project provides benefits by developing international partnerships and improving the Turkish language skills of US students. Funding is provided by the Office of International Science and Engineering and the Division of Earth Sciences.

The task a worker performs depends on its size, age and experience. How is task performance in ants controlled by a tiny amount of nerve tissue, the brain? The goal of the project is to discover how differences in the brains of worker ants in a colony control task performance, and how the ecology of a species may influence worker brain structure and behavior. Ants may change tasks as they age, beginning as nurses and ending as foragers. Their brains need to be plastic so that they can generate age-appropriate behavior. In some species, workers show specialized behaviors, such as defending the colony, and are equipped with large and powerful jaws that make them effective soldiers. If workers are specialized for defense, their brains must respond to stimuli associated with threats to the colony and control aggressive behavior. Thus the brain of a nurse should respond only to the needs of brood and the brain of a defender should respond to threats from enemies. The project will analyze ant social behavior and examine age- and task-specific differences in the size of worker brains, brain compartments and individual nerve cells as well as the chemical composition of the brains of workers of different species in an extremely diverse group of ants. The expected subtle brain differences will help to understand how slight changes in brain structure and function can result in pronounced behavioral differences and how behavior develops during maturation. The project will train graduate and undergraduate students (including minority students) in behavioral, anatomical, neurobiological and molecular techniques and enrich the education of K-12 students by introducing them to behavior, neuroscience, ecology and evolution.

First, for secure access control, it establishes a resilient and highly reliable wireless interface to strengthen or replace the current device-based and/or password-based security by the highly secure user-based access control. The major challenge lies in that user based access control generally requires reliable transmission of several orders of magnitude more bits than the traditional user verification process. In this project, resilient security protocols and high capacity access control protocols are designed for effective credential information transmission and real time user authentication. Second, in current privacy protection schemes, information confidentiality is mainly performed at the network layer independent of the PHY layer, and thus is far from adequate for multimedia wireless communications. This research enhances the PHY layer built-in security by integrating cryptographic techniques into the transmitter-receiver design. Based on both cryptographic techniques and inherent ambiguity in signal detection over multiple access channels, this project formulates a joint PHY layer and upper layer privacy protection mechanism. Finally, overall system integration and validation will be performed through a reconfigurable simulation platform. By directly addressing multiple pivotal wireless security concerns, it is anticipated the important technological advances to be achieved in this project will contribute significantly to the design and development of a new generation of highly secure wireless networks. Additionally, by integrating the technological advances into the undergraduate/graduate curricula, and through outreach activities, significant impacts are expected from this project on training a highly-skilled and diverse workforce in the areas of wireless communications and network security, and on educating the public with respect to the need for secure and ethical operations in wireless communications.

Several questions will be addressed:<br/>1. What are the net effects of continental-slope internal-wave-driven boundary mixing on the<br/>interior stratification of the ocean?<br/>2. Do finescale parameterizations for turbulent mixing fall short by a factor of 5 6 in canyons because of (i) a more coherent internal wave field than found in the open ocean or (ii) interactions with topography?<br/>Measurements will include full-depth velocity-temperature profile surveys with XCPs, time series<br/>of currents and water properties with transmissometer-equipped LADCP/CTD, time-series of turbulent mixing with a microstructure profiler, and a velocity and temperature profile time series of the bottom 120 m with a mooring equipped with ADCP and thermistor chain. These data will be used (i) to quantify the BBL energy budget by determining internal wave energy fluxes into and out of the boundary along with boundary-layer turbulent dissipation rates, and (ii) to characterize the distribution of nepheloid layers. Energy-flux divergence will be used to identify internal wave sources and sinks within the canyon while potential external sources will be identified from deep-water fluxes. In addition, new analysis techniques will be explored, including (i) the use of energy-flux co-spectra to diagnose internal wave reflection from the near-critical bottom slope, (ii) bi-coherence to evaluate relationships between high and low vertical wavenumbers, (iii) momentum-fluxes 'to evaluate bottom form drag, and (iv) stratification flux'and sediment flux to determine the exchange of mixed boundary water with the stratified interior. This work is in collaboration with Eric Kunze at the University of Victoria, who will make the microstructure measurements and participate in analysis and interpretation of the whole data set. It will benefit from recent modeling efforts and measurements on the slope south of Monterey Bay during ONR's 2006 AESOP program.<br/>Intellectual Merit: We are motivated by fundamental questions concerning (i) the exchange of fluid mixed on the boundary with that in the stratified interior and its role in global mixing and the thermohaline circulation, and (ii) how to better parameterize internal-wave-driven turbulent mixing near topography. The survey plan combines spatial coverage and high-frequency timeseries to allow rigorous testing of significance. The core XCP pattern spanning a full cycle of the semidiurnal tide will provide better resolution of a coherent internal wavefield in space and time than hitherto achieved outside the laboratory in order to better understand the cascade of energy through the internal wave field near sloping topography. In addition, exploratory measurements in other continental slope canyons will aid in expanding applicability to a global scope.<br/>Broader Impacts: The multi-institutional collaboration will advance interdisciplinary understanding of mixing processes in Monterey Canyon and other continental slope canyons, an important facet for local budgets of nutrients, sediment, and chemical tracers. Through the refinement of finescale mixing parameterizations, it will also aid large-scale mixing budgets and,<br/>potentially, climate model predictions. Education will be advanced through the support of graduate students and participation in outreach activities.

The development of rice varieties that produce grain with increased mineral nutrient contents and decreased levels of various toxic trace minerals could have a significant positive impact on human health, as food-based solutions to this hidden hunger offer sustainable solutions to these problems of malnutrition. This project will leverage work done in model systems and use high throughput elemental analysis, genomics, rice breeding and bioinformatics to uncover the genes and gene networks that regulate the mineral composition of rice grain. As a starting point, the project will take advantage of and explore the natural variation that exists in rice grain mineral content in the many thousands of rice varieties grown throughout the world. The rice grain ionomic data, DNA microarray genotyping, transcript profiling and mapping data, and QTL information generated will be made available via the web-based Purdue Ionomics Information Management System (PiiMS) (www.purdue.edu/dp/ionomics/), Gramene (http://www.gramene.org/) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). <br/><br/>The broader impacts of this project will include contributing to increasing bio-available mineral nutrients in plants, and to solving important problems in human health. If successful, nutrient-rich seed should also lead to agronomic benefits such as increased seedling vigor, resistance to disease and other stresses, and increased crop yields. Furthermore, understanding the pathways by which toxic metals accumulate in plants will enable the development of crops to exclude toxic metals and create healthier food sources, or to extract toxic metals from the soil as a strategy to clean up polluted lands and water. Educational outreach will include training of postdoctoral fellows, undergraduates and graduate students in the field of ionomics. Public outreach efforts will also include contributions to science museums through a genomics exhibit which is currently under development (www.genomicsexplorer.com).

Furthermore, simply adding security mechanisms is insufficient<br/>because BGP also lacks the guarantee that specification-compliant<br/>inputs always produce stable routes across the network.<br/><br/>This project addresses these shortcomings through research on various<br/>assumptions that guarantee good routing behavior and on methods to<br/>verify or enforce these assumptions to prevent deviation from that<br/>behavior. We identify and address attacks that have previously been<br/>studied as well as new attacks that have not yet received attention in<br/>the literature. We target incremental-deployment benefits and<br/>computational efficiency as primary desiderata; thus, our solutions<br/>can offer incentives for immediate adoption without system-wide<br/>changes.

Practical probe designs suitable for batch fabrication and with proper dynamics and noise -- imaging bandwidths in the 50-100kHz, and thermal noise levels in the nN range ? will be developed. Finally, control systems and methods using the unique capabilities of these probes will be designed and implemented.<br/><br/>BROADER IMPACT<br/>This research can move the atomic force microscope from research labs to industrial platforms such as inline semiconductor device metrology to build faster computers, as well as broadening its use in basic science applications. Through dissemination of devices and know-how, a rapid impact in nanotechnology and nanoscience is targeted. In addition to involvement of teachers from K-12 institutions, and undergraduate students in the research project, the long term objective is to provide each high school with an easily operated, fast atomic force microscope, opening a real window for students to explore the nanoscale phenomena.

Recent geomorphic research has documented profound and sustained changes resulting from flow regulation, including changes in channel properties, sediment transport, and reduced channel complexity leading to impaired ecological habitat both within the channel and across the broader riparian zone.  Several important research questions have emerged concerning the magnitude and direction of impacts across lateral and longitudinal scales caused by the interactive effects of flow regulation and the progressive downstream tributary inputs of both water and sediment.  This research project will focus on subwatersheds of the Connecticut River valley, an area significantly affected by historical flow regulation and impoundment by both flood control and hydroelectric dams.  The investigators will quantify (1) the length scale of impact of impoundment laterally across floodplains and progressively downstream of dams; (2) the geomorphic adjustments associated with tributary inputs; and (3) the changes in riparian community structure resulting from impoundment and downstream flow contributions.  The project specifically focuses on the length scale of impact imposed by these dams through their associated flow reductions, their resulting changes to the sediment discharge regime by reservoir trapping, and the combined interactive effects of dams on sediment transport and storage as well as flow, especially as part of the progressive downstream inputs of water and sediment by tributaries.  Through the use of fallout radionuclides, especially 210-Pb inventories on floodplains, stage-discharge flow modeling, and riparian vegetation sampling, this project will quantify the increased connectivity downstream of dams associated with increased tributary flow.  To capture the effect of tributary inputs on sediment discharge, a field design will be employed to measure (1) the activity of 7-Be as a fingerprinting of sediment and (2) changes in bed elevation along the longitudinal profile.  The gradient and aggradational adjustments then will be linked to the sediment residence time through the use of 7-Be.<br/><br/>This research project will elucidate the links between hydrologic changes in flow and inundation patterns, sediment inputs, and ecological responses.  Results from this research can be used as a template to gage the lateral and longitudinal impacts of impoundment and can thus help provide the approaches for ecological amelioration.  Moreover, from a geomorphic perspective, the project results will help ascertain the morphologic structure of watersheds and the fundamental ways that tributary inputs influence mainstem characteristics in both regulated and unregulated conditions.<br/><br/>

However, the potential exists to detect and characterize a laser beam by exploiting changes it induces in the atmosphere. As a high-power laser propagates through the atmosphere, it changes the index of refraction of the air and this change will disturb the propagation of radio frequency (and microwave) signals. The laser-induced discontinuity in the index of refraction serves as a radar target. The meteorological community has used radar for many years to detect and characterize changes in the index of refraction on the same order as the changes induced by a high-power laser beam. The purpose of the proposed work is to investigate and characterize the atmospheric changes induced by a high-power laser and the radio frequency scattering from those induced changes, which will support a study on the feasibility of detecting and characterizing high-power laser beams using radar. This research establishes a solid foundation for the development of a unique method based on radar to provide an out-of-band, off-axis laser detection and characterization capability. Because the radar method does not rely on in-band sidelobe or scattered energy, it should not need precision cueing (time and location) information and thus, has the potential for a search capability. The results of this research project will provide an enduring capability for the community by characterizing and modeling the atmospheric changes induced by the high-power laser and the electromagnetic scattering from those changes. These results form the basis for developing the capability to sense high-power laser through indirect means. The results of the radar feasibility study will provide foundation for assessing and guiding the development of high-power laser sensing methods and systems.

The study will use data assimilation based on the Local Ensemble Transform Kalman Filter method to examine the impact of observations on forecasts, and in particular to determine a priori the most needed locations for specific measurements (targeted observations) to improve forecasts. This research extends previous work in perfect model scenarios (comparing models to models) to more realistic applications (forcast models versus real world). The study will also examine the predictability time limits for different circulation regimes, investigate seasonal effects on predictability, and assess the impacts of observations collected in the upcoming THORPEX Pacific Asian Regional Campaign (T-PARC) on forecasts. The study will use a recent operational version of the Global Forecast System model of the National Centers for Environmental Prediction. The fruits of the research have the possibility to improve forecasting by pinpointing where additional observations are most useful, thereby optimizing deployable resources. The use of an operational forecast model should ease the transition of knowledge from the basic research phase to operations. A graduate student will be supported and involved in the research.
0724032	Social and Cultural Context of Racial Inequalities in Health	BCS	CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY, Biological Anthropology	09/01/2007	06/01/2010	Clarence Gravlee	FL	University of Florida	Standard Grant	Jeffrey Mantz	08/31/2012	$365,550.00	Christopher McCarty	cgravlee@ufl.edu	1 UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA	GAINESVILLE	FL	326112002	3523923516	SBE	1390, 1392	0000, 1392, OTHR, 1390, 9179	$0.00	Dr. Clarence C. Gravlee and Dr. Christopher McCarty will undertake research on the social and cultural influences on racial inequalities in health. Some social scientists view race as a cultural construct, not a biological reality. But this view is coming under increasing scrutiny, as medical researchers seek to explain racial inequalities in health in terms of genetic differences. This development challenges social scientists to clarify how race exists as a social and cultural phenomenon that has force in people's lives and, indeed, one that has biological consequences. <br/><br/>The driving research question is why African Americans suffer disproportionately from hypertension, or chronic high blood pressure. This problem is a key test case, because it is often attributed to unknown genetic differences between racially defined groups. This project tests the alternative view that social and cultural factors account for the pattern of hypertension among people of African descent. In particular, it seeks to identify the contributions of social structure and the experience of culturally defined stressors to blood pressure variation among African Americans. The study combines (a) ethnography to explore how class and color shape the meaning of everyday social interaction and (b) methods of social network analysis to examine how the social structure in which individuals are embedded shapes exposure to racism and other social stressors. The research will be conducted among African Americans in Tallahassee, FL, a city with a large and socioeconomically diverse African-American community, as well as a history of racial struggle and civil rights activism. The exploratory phase involves participant observation and two rounds of ethnographic interviewing (N = 48 in each round). The explanatory phase will involve a representative survey (N = 350) of adult African Americans in Tallahassee to test the associations between social network characteristics, the experience of culturally defined stressors, and blood pressure variation, above and beyond known risk factors for high blood pressure.<br/><br/>This study contributes an anthropological perspective to national discussions about race and racism. It develops a novel application of social network analysis and builds on efforts to integrate the social and biological sciences. In particular, it will identify the biological consequences of racism and contribute to our understanding of how social and cultural processes become embodied in health.

This project focuses on the mathematical issues that have been raised by previous large-scale simulations, and seeks to get a deeper understanding of how the qualitative properties of intrinsic and ionic currents in single cells shape the complex behaviour that has been seen in a variety of simulations of large and small networks. The work focuses on two specific situations which present many of the general issues. The first is the interaction of the gamma (40-90 Hz) and theta (4-12 Hz) rhythms in the hippocampus. As shown in previous numerical and experimental work, the gamma and theta rhythms appear to be produced in vitro by different sub-networks of hippocampal neurons, with some components in common; simulations have shown that changes in parameters can switch control of the common elements and change the power in the different frequency bands. The project considers the global bifurcations involved in switches of control. The second situation concerns changes of brain rhythms in the presence of the anesthetic propofol which, at the biophysical level, acts mainly by increasing the decay time and amplitude of GABA_A mediated inhibition. A central question of the previous modeling work is the origin of the so-call beta buzz, in which a low dose of propofol excites, rather than sedates, the patient, with an increase in the power in the beta frequency bands (13-30 Hz) and a decrease in lower and higher frequency bands. Simulations have shown this un-intuitive behaviour in model networks having multiple components, notably by the creation of clustering of inhibitory cells into subgroups firing in antiphase, transforming low frequencies into higher ones. Kopell mentors many graduate students and postdoctoral fellows; this project ties mathematical analysis to other work focusing on function, and thus allows trainees to see how mathematics can be used to bridge from biophysics to function.<br/><br/>The nervous system produces electrical activity in all cognitive states, and this activity generally displays significant power at any given time in multiple frequency bands.

The work addresses the general issues of how the brain produces its multiple frequencies, and how changes in biophysics can change the mixture of dynamic components. In the first sub-project, this is linked with the central question of how networks react to inputs with spatial and temporal structure reflecting the coding of information. In the second, the work helps to bridge the knowledge of biophysical effects of an anesthetic to its functional properties (inducing loss of consciousness) by tying the biophysical changes to changes in dynamics known to be related to cognitive state. The analytical tools proposed have been used in much simpler contexts. The work will require the development of extensions to allow application to larger and more complex networks. The extensions should be applicable to a wide range of neural applications. Kopell is co-Director of the Center for BioDynamics and the Program in Mathematical and Computational Neuroscience at Boston University. In this context, she works with and mentors a large number of graduate students and postdocs, including many women. This project ties mathematical analysis to other work focusing on function, and thus allows these and other trainees to see how mathematics can be used to bridge from biophysics to function.

Many important methods for nonlinear optimization seek to determine which inequality constraints hold as equalities at the solution, so that the problem can be simplified to an equality constrained problem. As the number of inequality constraints grows, the standard approaches, which use quadratic programming, become too slow. Thus one needs to predict the correct active constraints in a more efficient way. The active-set identification techniques developed in this project will be based on the solution of linear programming subproblems and will allow the estimate of the active constraint set to change by many constraints at a time. New general purpose nonlinear optimization algorithms will be developed using these active-set identification techniques. This project will develop software implementations of these algorithms, as well as a general theory of active-set identification that covers these algorithms.<br/><br/>If successful, the proposed research will allow for the solution of significantly larger nonlinear optimization models (particularly problems with many inequality constraints) than can currently be solved using active-set methods. These more powerful algorithms may be applied to previously intractable models arising in areas such as medical imaging, classification, signal processing, chemical process control, power systems management, integrated circuit design and finance. In addition, active set approaches like this will be more effective at making use of a warm start compared with interior point methods. This will be beneficial for quickly solving subproblems that arise in branch and bound methods for mixed integer nonlinear programming. The theoretical framework for active-set identification developed as part of this project will provide a basis for exploring the development of future active-set based algorithms.

Hughes of the University of Vermont. This research involves carrying out novel synthetic approaches to carbon single-walled nanotube segments with specific and controllable structural parameters such as the length, diameter and chiral vector, or the orientation of the six-membered rings of carbon atoms relative to the axis of the tube. These approaches to the strained nanotube segments rely on the synthesis of planar, unstrained phenylene macrocycles containing alkyne or cyclopentadienone functional groups. These planar macrocycles will be synthesized and then additional phenyl groups will be added using a Diels-Alder cycloaddition. The phenyl groups are introduced in an arrangement that will allow a subsequent oxidation reaction to fuse the rings together into the target tubular structures. Control over the diameter and length of the product nanotubes will be achieved by controlling the diameter of the precursor macrocycle and the size of the auxiliary phenyl-containing reactants. The strain inherent in the nanotube segments will thus be incorporated in a highly incremental fashion. Once synthesized, the solid-state packing and the conductivity of the nanotube segments will be evaluated. Chemical modifications of the segments will also be performed analogous to those currently carried out on larger nanotubes with less well-defined structures; such chemical modifications of these model systems will elucidate the chemical events taking place in the larger nanotubes.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of this project are in part the training of graduate students in organic synthesis and characterization, and in the characterization of organic materials. In addition, the product nanotube segments are models of the larger carbon single-walled nanotubes currently produced with relatively little control over their diameters and lengths. The segments produced by the method proposed may be suitable as seeds for the production of large amounts of nanotubes with specific structures. Since the structure of the carbon nanotube affects its potential usefulness as a material for organic electronic applications such as field-effect transistors, light-emitting diodes and photovoltaics, these smaller model systems could be used to further the understanding of the physical bases of these phenomena and could be potential feedstocks for materials in eventual devices.

It typically involves a liquid binder that acts as a bonding agent between particles and produces larger granules to improve flowability, enhance the homogeneous distribution of all components, decrease dustiness and prepare the material for tabletting and subsequent processing. It is in wide industrial use and plays an especially important role in pharmaceutical manufacturing. Drug formulation involves the granulation of an active pharmaceutical ingredient along with an inert excipient in the presence of liquid binder that acts as the coalescing medium and which upon drying provides the cohesive strength of the granule. It is a complex, multiphase, multicomponent process, that remains difficult to scale up and control because of the non-trivial coupling of the many variables that influence the quality of the final product. This project focuses on the development of realistic multicomponent population balance models for granulation that use physically-based agglomeration kernels and are validated against experiments. Simulations of multicomponent granulation with one (or two) excipient(s) and a liquid binder will be conducted using a Monte Carlo method that tracks the evolution of a constant number of granules (constant-N Monte Carlo). Collision rates will be calculated from the kinetic theory of granular flow with corrections obtained from mesoscopic simulations of binder-granule interactions. Simulations will be validated against a series of experiments with four excipients (mannitol, lactose, A-TAB, avicel) using aqueous solutions of hydroxypropyl cellulose as the binder, in a pilot-scale Wurster fluidized bed granulator. In addition to simulation and experiments, theory will be developed to describe the distribution and blending of components when the rate of agglomeration is a function of the granule composition, a dependence which may arise from variations in the amount of binder on the granule surface, or different wetting/spreading properties at the granule/binder interface. This program will result in the formulation of theoretical principles of component-blending by agglomeration and in the development of simulation tools for multicomponent particulate processes. Ultimately, the goal is to couple multicomponent population balances to hydrodynamic models to obtain realistic simulators for granulation.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/>This work will be undertaken jointly between Penn State and Merck, and with Imperial College (London) through an unfunded collaboration. The PI on this program has considerable experience with graduate, undergraduate as well as minority and female recruitment. This program will support two graduate students who will be jointly advised by the academic and industrial collaborators. It will provide projects for undergraduate research and senior theses, will enhance the curriculum through development of specialty courses on Particle Technology, and will offer the opportunity to both graduate and undergraduate students to visit and interact with industry.

Although none of them are conclusive, they all consistently point to a similar conclusion: the oceanic circulation is changing. Policymakers, however, face the dilemma that although the reported changes could be the heralded response of the oceans to global warming, they could, as well, be a natural mode of ocean variability. To differentiate natural from anthropogenic changes we need increase our understanding of the factors that control the low-frequency variability of the oceanic circulation. The thermohaline circulation is a global phenomenon and to interpret its variations we need to improve our understanding of how the different basins communicate with each, that is, how the variability in a particular region affects the entire system. To interpret the climate-related changes occurring in the North Atlantic, for example, we need to understand the variability of its contiguous basin, the South Atlantic; not only because its heat and salt fluxes are essential for the formation of the North Atlantic deep waters, but also because it is its natural<br/>link with all the other major oceans. In this project scientists from Oregon State University will combine the results of ocean general circulation models with remote and in-situ observation to determine the dominant patterns of low-frequency variability of the South Atlantic circulation. <br/><br/>Broader impacts: This study is focused on those aspects of the South Atlantic circulation that are most relevant to the climate system and its broader impacts are related to it. Little is known about the low-frequency variations of the South Atlantic circulation and its interocean exchanges. This dearth of information is of serious concern to the scientific community because the South Atlantic is the only nexus between the North Atlantic and the rest of the world ocean.

The approach is to use the unique properties of semiconducting B-C (bandgap tunability, high interfacial spin density of states with ferromagnets, and small spin-orbit coupling) as a barrier material in spin devices) and to conduct spin-resolved photoemission, near-atomic-scale characterization, transport measurements, and device modeling. The research aims are to study novel non-oxide barrier layers which will enable efficient spin injection and detection even near ambient temperatures as well as less-demanding, highly-robust, scalable fabrication of spintronic and ultrafast devices. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit:<br/><br/>The intellectual merit lies in the ability to correlate the interface electronic states, structure, and transport behavior and so to understand and optimize properties of the proposed, and future, magnetic tunnel junction devices. This will offer insight to other spintronics approaches by clearly delineating the role that the above parameters play in contributing to spin transport properties. <br/><br/>Broader Impact:<br/><br/>The research will spur investigation of non-oxide barriers and open a path to efficient spin-injection devices using non-magnetic semiconductors. The research team will increase graduate student research participation from under-represented groups (particularly women), train graduate students in sophisticated experimental and modeling techniques, and provide them with national networking opportunities not available regionally. For outreach, especially to rural Nebraska, hands-on science and technology learning modules based on semiconducting BC will be developed as model in-class resources for teachers and will be integrated with planned growth of the NSF/UNL Cosmic Ray Observatory Program. <br/><br/>

It is refining and testing these modules with diverse chemical engineering students at five partner schools, with particular outreach to underrepresented student populations. The modules are designed to give students carefully designed situations where reality, rather than the professor, can dispute their misconceptions. These educational materials are being disseminated through a variety of mechanisms, including an on-site faculty workshop as well as an instruction manual with inquiry-based activities, supplementary instructional aids, and reliable assessment tools. The effectiveness of the materials is being assessed using previously developed concept inventories as part of a comprehensive evaluation plan coordinated by an outside evaluation expert. The project is providing evidence about whether this approach can be used to address a broad range of persistent misconceptions in engineering science and whether it can improve underrepresented student retention. Finally, these materials can be used for ABET accreditation, since they provide a proven vehicle for addressing important learning outcomes and a valid and efficient assessment tool to document students' learning gains.

This project aims to extend research on the mobilization of law in a new direction by examining how social identity and status influences the conceptualization and mobilization of authority. As government employment becomes more diverse, a growing number of public officials confront what may be called a power paradox, a condition in which a person has high official status but lacks traditional social status and in which the mobilization of authority may be especially problematic. The law and society tradition offers rich insights into how rights and law interact with identity and social status. First, although rights and law offer potentially powerful resources on behalf of the disadvantaged, they also constrain the range of options and strategies available to the disadvantaged. Second, although a wide range of people mobilize rights and law, those with lower social status may be especially hesitant to do so, or may do so in ways different from those with higher status. This project will study the mobilization of authority and its interaction with social status in two contexts, policing and city management. Police officers convey iconic images of authority in America: they carry the trappings of official status and exercise authority on the street in interactions with ordinary citizens. City managers exercise their authority over complex public bureaucracies; they typically do not have the visual cues of authority enjoyed by police officers, but, within their organizations, their official status is well known to all employees. In each setting, employment is increasingly diverse. This project uses open-ended interviews and close-ended surveys of city administrators and police officers to examine variations in the frequency and types of challenges to authority, conceptualizations of authority, and the range and types of strategies for mobilizing authority, particularly in relation to officials' social status. The results may have important implications for how we think about official status, authority, and, ultimately, the state itself. The results will enhance understanding of how members of underrepresented groups cope with challenges to their legal authority. As preliminary data indicate that coping strategies include invocation of the law or legal rules, a possible implication of the proposed research is that, as state employment becomes more diverse, the face of the state may become more legalized as officials lacking traditional social status cope with challenges to their authority by invoking the law or legal rules. There may also be implications for policy and for training of government officials.

This discovery represents the only known record of Cretaceous reptilian remains from the mid-Pacific region, and the oldest known crocodilian remains in the Pacific oceanic realm. <br/><br/>So far, they have recovered a pristine 1 cm long cone of a crocodilian tooth, several other well preserved smaller crocodilian teeth, fish teeth representing a variety of feeding strategies, fish scales, and currently unidentified vertebrate bones. Associated with these are terrestrial plant debris, palynomorphs, amber, freshwater algal remains, oysters, and ostracods. Abundant pyrite, glauconite, and environmentally sensitive ostracods, indicate a restricted marine paleoenvironnment with low oxygen conditions. This deposit has the potential of yielding remains of other Cretaceous vertebrates such as other marine reptiles, birds, pterosaurs and terrestrial island fauna. <br/><br/>To minimize further destructive sampling of this small amount of core material, PIs will use the ultra-high resolution X-ray CT system at the University of Texas to construct high-resolution 3D images of this core interval. This imaging will allow them to locate and extract other vertebrate remains from the working half of the core, and view all vertebrate remains in the archive core half which cannot be sampled destructively. CT imaging will also enable PIs to study the sedimentary structures in order to understand the depositional history of this layer. Other near-shore marine and terrestrial deposits occur in other deep-sea drill cores, and the use of CT-scanning on this deposit will demonstrate its usefulness in searching other cores for possible vertebrate remains.<br/><br/>The significance of this research is that it will provide a unique, unprecedented view of a Cretaceous vertebrate fauna living in a lagoonal paleoenvironment as far removed as possible from any other known Cretaceous and continental reptilian remains. This will add a unique perspective to our understanding of vertebrate evolution, paleoecology and paleomigrations.<br/><br/>After completion of this study, the vertebrate remains extracted from this core will be stored permanently at the Texas Natural Science Center, which houses the Texas Memorial Museum, in Austin, Texas. The CT images will be archived in the NSF supported Digital Morphology Library at the University of Texas at Austin. The permanent archive half of the ODP core will be stored at the Gulf Coast Repository of the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program at Texas A&M University.

In a network, security and communication are interdependent. Cryptographic tools will be required to ensure that communication is dependable despite hackers' denial-of-service attacks and other sabotage. On the other hand, proper communications architecture could provide primitives that make powerful cryptographic tools for security, such as secure multiparty computation, e_cient enough to be implemented. Unfortunately, research on reliable communications and computation in a network has traditionally been studied without consideration of security, and vice versa.  This research examines a model of communication channels that includes security considerations in a robust way. In this model, protocols can be simultaneously evaluated for the two dual objectives of secrecy and reliability.  This model unites previous approaches to these questions from the points of view of cryptography, distributed systems, and error-correction.  The model also unites information-theoretic techniques (with security based on the attacker's inability to access certain information) with complexitytheoretic approaches (based on the attacker's inability to solve intractable computational problems). Possible constructions of channels with stronger properties (increased privacy, authentication, or reliability) from those with weaker properties will be explored. For example, is it possible to take an arbitrary channel that gives only slightly more information to the intended receiver than to an attacker and use it to build a highly reliable and almost completely secret channel? Can we use a channel for secret, reliable communication to create a channel emulating a virtual broadcast? What is the relationship between secrecy and anonymity?
0722033	NeTS-FIND: Collaborative Research: A New Approach to Internet Naming and Name Resolution	CNS	RES IN NETWORKING TECH & SYS	09/01/2007	06/22/2009	Scott Shenker	CA	International Computer Science Institute	Continuing grant	Darleen L.

For instance, the vast majority of current Internet usage is data retrieval and service access, whereas the architecture was designed around host-to-host applications such as telnet and ftp. Moreover, the original Internet was a purely transparent carrier of packets, but now the various network stakeholders use middleboxes to improve security and accelerate applications. To adapt to these changes, this project will design, develop and deploy a design called the Data- Oriented Network Architecture (DONA). DONA replaces DNS names with flat, self-certifying names, and replaces DNS name resolution with a name-based anycast primitive that lives above the IP layer. <br/><br/>Broader Impact: DONA improves data retrieval and service access by providing stronger and more architecturally coherent support for name persistence, content availability, and data authentication. It can also be extended to provide support for caching and RSS-like updates.

Through opportunistic access to the available spectrum, CRNs aim at improving the utilization of network resources by achieving higher spatial reuse, programmable connectivity, and increased network availability. The research agenda includes centralized analytical formulations that aim at optimizing the operation of the bottom three layers as well as distributed routing and medium access protocols that implement the outcomes of such optimization. Joint optimization of spectrum, transmission powers, and rates for CR communications will be considered in the presence of several primary (spectrum-licensed) radio networks (PRNs). <br/><br/>No feedback from the PRNs will be assumed. Several formulations will be studied, which differ in the assumptions made on the channel dynamics (indirectly, user mobility), optimization window (packet vs. flow time scale), and availability or otherwise of power masks. Besides one-hop optimizations, the project will also consider multi-channel, multi-path optimizations at the packet and the flow time scales. The optimization results will then be integrated into the design of distributed channel access and path discovery/maintenance protocols for opportunistic CRNs. Depending on the frequency bands of interest, fixed power masks on CR transmissions may or may not be available. Protocols will be developed for both cases. In the absence of a fixed power mask, statistical modeling of PR interference will be conducted and used in the design of a MAC protocol that supports a probabilistic guarantee on the outage rate of PR receptions. The treatment will extend to both connectionless and connection-oriented applications. The cross-disciplinary nature of this project is expected to have a profound impact on many wireless technologies used in both civilian and military applications, including sensor networks, mesh networks, military radios, and wireless LANs. The optimization framework provides a general methodology that can significantly improve the performance, connectivity, and inter-operability of resource-constrained wireless networks in general.

The spectrometer will be utilized in research projects including 1) structural determination of oligosaccharides, 2) conformation determination of molecular nano-switches, and 3) structural and mechanistic studies of nano-scale supramolecular systems. The impact of this award will affect a significant number of minority students as the campus population consists of 60% minority students. <br/><br/>Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these high field NMR studies will result in 1) higher resolution with increased signal dispersion, 2) precise coupling information for computational modeling and 3) more reliable kinetic studies of phase-transitions in low concentration samples.

Researchers have also documented the world-wide disappearance of local ecological knowledge. If local ecological knowledge provides so many benefits, why would it disappear? To answer the question we propose to conduct a study among the Soliga, a tribal group in southwest India. Soliga still depend on local ecological knowledge for their survival. We hypothesize that parents who through their live have benefited more from local ecological knowledge will invest more resources in teaching local ecological knowledge to their children, whereas parents who have benefited more from schooling, will invest less in local ecological knowledge and promote school attendance. The research will develop and test hypotheses about the transmission of culture using local ecological knowledge as a case study and conduct a quantitative analysis of the paths through which the Soliga transmit local knowledge. The research also will provide hands-on training and mentoring research experience for a Ph.D. student in cultural anthropology.

This project aims to develop statistical natural language analysis tools to disambiguate the morphological and syntactic structure of non-English text. Specifically, the objective of the pilot study is to design, train, implement, and disseminate statistical morpho-syntactic parsing models for Arabic and Hebrew. This project starts with a straightforward formalism (statistical head automaton grammars) and makes use of novel discriminative learning methods to build models that can be easily ported to new datasets. While previous work has simplified the problem by assuming perfect morphological disambiguation prior to parsing, for most languages, accurate morphological disambiguation is not yet available; this project aims to integrate morphological disambiguation into the parsing algorithm for better accuracy on both tasks. Impact: This project will improve global access to information by directly advancing core language processing technology in languages spoken by more than half a billion people and - because of the language-portability principle - by facilitating future work on many more languages. It is expected that this project will improve the state-of-the-art in parsing accuracy for the languages under consideration, and the models and algorithms developed will be made freely available for research purposes. These tools are expected to aid researchers working on applied technologies such as machine translation and multilingual information extraction.

To achieve better performance, we adopt an HSN model consisting of a small number of powerful high-end sensors (H-sensors) and a large number of low-end sensors (L-sensors). The objective of this project is to investigate innovative network architectures of HSNs, and develop energy-efficient, self-healing schemes and routing protocols for HSNs. We plan to build an integrated research and education program. The research components of the project consist of the following two parts: <br/>. Investigating efficient and robust network architectures of HSNs.<br/>We will investigate innovative network architectures for two different types of HSNs: HSNs where the locations of H-sensors are controllable and NOT controllable. We will determine the optimal density of H-sensors and L-sensors, and the optimal locations of H-sensors to minimize the cost of sensor nodes while ensuring a network lifetime and coverage requirement. We propose a novel Density-Varying-Deployment scheme for H-sensors. We will also design robust clustering schemes that can tolerate H-sensor failures and provide reliable network structures.<br/>. Designing self-healing and energy-efficient schemes and routing protocols for HSNs.<br/>The primary functionality of wireless sensor networks is to sense the environment and transmit the acquired information to a base station for further processing. Thus, routing is an essential operation in sensor networks. Typical sensor nodes are small, unreliable devices with limited energy supply. The routing protocols should be energy-efficient and robust to sensor failures, and be able to find new paths when nodes fail. By utilizing powerful H-sensors, we will design self-healing, energy-efficient routing protocols for HSNs which take into consideration of data fusion. <br/>The research is tightly coupled with an educational program that includes the following four themes, <br/>1) Mentoring graduate and undergraduate students, and recruiting students of underrepresented groups in North Dakota and Tennessee to participate in the project. <br/>2) Developing a new graduate course-Wireless Sensor Networks. <br/>3) Field study of sensor networks. Sensor networks have been deployed in several farms in North Dakota for agricultural monitoring and several chemical/nuclear plants in Tennessee for hazard monitoring. We will take students to the farms and plants to study how to improve the performance of these real sensor networks by applying our research results. <br/>4) Integrating research and education together by setting up a Heterogeneous Sensor Network Lab. <br/>The Intellectual Merits include:<br/>1) In this research, we will develop innovative network architectures for two different kinds of HSNs, i.e., the locations of H-sensors are controllable or not. <br/>2) We will design energy-efficient and self-healing routing protocols for HSNs, which are robust to node failures and prolong network lifetime. <br/>The Broader Impacts are:<br/>Recruiting students of underrepresented groups, including female, low incoming, first generation, Native American, and African American students in North Dakota

Device scaling of silicon transistors has been the fundamental basis for the phenomenal success of the semiconductor and electronics industry. While there have been significant accomplishments in scientific discovery in recent years at the single-device level at the nanoscale, a major gap exists between such single-device-level results and the research required to harness the science into practical design technologies competitive with silicon technologies at the end of device scaling. This project uses an interdisciplinary approach to overcome fundamental challenges by combining novel CNFET-based robust imperfection-immune design and automation techniques together with new CNFET modeling and processing techniques. The ideas developed in this project will be experimentally validated through working CNFET-based circuits. This research program also integrates research and education required to explore novel, nanoscale electronic designs through graduate and undergraduate training, and public education on nanotechnology.

Specific equipment to be purchased includes: 1) multiple acoustic Doppler current profilers (ADCP), surface meteorologic (MET) sensor packages, bottom water temperature sensors and associated hardware to initially install five ADCP/MET observational systems along the reach of the lower Buffalo River; 2) a bathymetric profiling system; and 3) a laser diffraction based grain size analysis system. The acquisition of these instruments will support research on the physical processes that control sedimentation and bottom surface morphology (e.g., furrows) in the lower reaches of the Buffalo River, which due to lake wind-driven seiche effects exhibits hydrodynamic behavior analogous to estuarine dynamics. PIs from Buffalo State College and Middlebury College in Vermont will incorporate observational data into models for hydro and sedimentary bedform dynamics in the Buffalo River and Lake Champlain. The Buffalo River is heavily impacted by industrial effluents and bottom sediments sequester a large variety of deleterious inorganic and organic compounds. Advances in understanding of the hydrodynamic forcing of sedimentary deposition and transport have ramifications for remediation efforts. Buffalo State College (BSC) is a Hispanic serving undergraduate institution, and Middlebury College is a liberal arts institution in Vermont with active undergraduate research programs.
0700238	Problems in Function Theory and Operator Theory	DMS	ANALYSIS PROGRAM	08/15/2007	08/03/2007	Richard Rochberg	MO	Washington University	Standard Grant	Bruce P. Palka	07/31/2012	$131,958.00		rr@math.wustl.edu	CAMPUS BOX 1054	Saint Louis	MO	631304862	3147474134	MPS	1281	0000, OTHR	$0.00	This project has two components. The first is a study of the operator theory and function theory of the symmetric Fock space. The principal investigator and his collaborators have recently developed a geometric characterization of the Carleson measures for that space. They believe that this result, together with the discretization techniques developed in obtaining it, will provide effective tools for the major immediate goal, which is to describe the interpolating sequences for this Fock space. The second component is the study of the relation between the Rankin-Cohen bracket operation and the direct sum decomposition of tensor products of Hardy and Bergman spaces. Both the bracket and the decomposition are implemented using the same bilinear differential operator, the transvectant. Hence it is natural to speculate that the algebraic structure induced on the graded space of automorphic forms by the bracket (an associative, noncommutative product structure) is mirrored by a new algebraic structure in the tensor product decomposition. The principal investigator proposes to identify that structure and develop its algebraic and analytic properties.<br/><br/>The first component of this project, studying the symmetric Fock space, is part of a mathematical program that has evolved in function theory and harmonic analysis for thirty years -- the use of discretization techniques to study continuous phenomena. Beyond its contribution to theoretical mathematics, this program has led to major advances in signal processing techniques and other areas of data analysis. Wavelet analysis is the best known product of this program, but there are many others. The work on the Fock space is squarely in that tradition. It will be an exploration of how a particular discretization technique that is known to be very effective in theoretical mathematics and in numerical applications can be adapted to a much more sophisticated geometric setting. The second component of the project, the study of the relation between the Rankin-Cohen bracket and the decomposition of certain tensor products, is a response to the observation that the same complicated computational constructs (transvectants) show up in these two, so far, unrelated contexts. A basic principle in mathematics is that such accidents are almost always the first indication of unexpected, and sometimes deep, connections between what had been seen as unrelated areas. The applicant proposes to establish that that is the situation here and to develop the new insights suggested by those connections.

Vision provides the richest but also most difficult input, since unambiguous and stable features that can serve as landmarks for navigation are hard to obtain. <br/>Challenges include the rich geometry of the world, changing scenes and obstacles, occlusion, lighting changes, specular and transparent surfaces, to name a few. Maintaining an accurate 3D model of world features and using them for localization and navigation is difficult due to the sheer amount of data to be processed.<br/><br/>To face these challenges, this project presents a framework for navigation from one-dimensional circular feature sequences extracted from 2D panoramic images. Since many real-world navigation tasks of mobile entities are in the plane (e.g., walking in a single building floor, driving in the city), the goal is to identify a reduced feature set sufficient for navigation that uses little storage space and can be processed quickly.<br/><br/>The key motivation for this work is to develop a simplified visual feature model that allows robust navigation in the plane but avoids most of the difficulties associated with extracting, modeling, and matching true 3D features and solving the associated six degree-of- freedom structure-from-motion problem. This work advances the state of the art in vision-based navigation on several fronts, with novel contributions in both robotics and computer vision. Specific algorithmic contributions include new feature descriptors invariant to planar motion, fast circular feature matching algorithms that allow both unmatched features and ordering reversals, probabilistic topological motion planning methods that include explicit modeling of the reliability of feature detection and identification, and strategies for graph-based world modeling and selective feature storage.<br/><br/>The proposed techniques have wide applicability, ranging from autonomous robot navigation in unknown environments to camera-based navigation aides for pedestrians, bicyclists, and cars. The project also provides an opportunity to expose undergraduates at a liberal- arts college to the world of research, experimentation, and discovery.<br/><br/>Undergraduate students at Middlebury College - an undergraduate institution in rural Vermont - will be actively involved in all components of this research. The student researchers will also join the PIs in authoring papers and attending conferences. Other students will benefit from the research activities through the integration of current research topics into the curriculum and through use of the lab facilities enhanced by the project. Tight integration of research and education is a central career goal of the PIs. Based on experience gained in prior and current collaboration with undergraduates, robotics and computer vision research is ideally suited to excite and challenge students.<br/><br/>Progress on this project will be regularly reported at http:// vision.middlebury.edu/navigation

The work is aimed at learning how different forms of reactant motion such as translation, vibration, and rotation control reactivity. Studies will also investigate and explain the branching between different product channels. Sophisticated instrumentation such as a guided ion beam tandem mass spectrometer will be employed to aid in experiments with model polyatomic ions. Professor Anderson and his team will also couple experimental data with theoretical calculations to explore the dynamical origins of effects observed in the experiments. <br/><br/>Studying factors that control the reaction of polyatomic ions will enable extension to reactions of polyatomics in general. The ions selected for study are of practical importance in atmospheric, cometary, interstellar, and plasma chemistry, for example. Professor Anderson, along with two graduate students and a post-doctoral fellow will be the primary researchers on this project, while undergraduate and high-school students will be involved in a related project on instrument development that involves a significant mathematics component. Prof. Anderson will continue his efforts at recruiting minority students through a number of activities, including his partnership with the Utah MESA/STEP Program.
0732196	MSPA-MCS:  Collaborative Research: Algorithms for Near-Optimal Multistage Decision-Making under Uncertainty: Online Learning from Historical Samples	DMS	SPECIAL PROJECTS - CCF, MSPA-INTERDISCIPLINARY	09/01/2007	08/03/2007	Paat Rusmevichientong	NY	Cornell University	Standard Grant	Tie Luo	08/31/2010	$172,695.00	David Shmoys	rusmevic@marshall.usc.edu	373 Pine Tree Road	Ithaca	NY	148502820	6072555014	MPS	2878, 7454	0000, 7303, OTHR	$0.00	Collaborative Research: Algorithms for Near-Optimal Multistage Decision-Making under Uncertainty: Online Learning from Historical Samples<br/><br/>Abstract<br/><br/>Recent advances in information technologies enable firms to collect and maintain huge amounts of raw data regarding demand, sales history and other aspects of their operations.  However, little is known about using this data effectively and efficiently within their decision-making processes, which can often be modeled as multi-stage stochastic optimization problems.  In many application domains, such as supply chain management and revenue management, these give rise to complex problems, where the decision in each stage must be made under uncertainty about the future evolution of an underlying stochastic process.  Traditional approaches to these problems assume that the uncertainty is defined through explicitly specified probability distributions that are known a priori; the knowledge of these distributions is crucial to the development of the corresponding optimization algorithms. However, in most practical situations the exact distributions are not known, and only historical data is available.  This research project aims to develop a general-purpose sampling-based algorithmic framework for these models that, unlike traditional approaches, uses the raw historical data as the source of samples. First, we plan to develop sampling-based algorithmic approaches to approximately solve complex stochastic dynamic programming formulations, the dominant paradigm used for these problems.  Second, we focus on sampling-based algorithms for models that combine optimization and learning simultaneously.  A common theme between these two research thrusts, and a central feature of our research project, is the development of explicit quantitative analysis of the performance of our algorithms that provide guarantees on the sample-size needed to assure a specified error bound with respect to optimal solution for the true underlying probability distribution.<br/><br/>Consider a firm like Amazon that provides millions of different items to customers throughout the US. Clearly, it is important for the company to have the inventory that its customers want, since if an item is out of stock, then the customer is likely to purchase the item from elsewhere. On the other hand, maintaining extra inventory for undesired items has the disadvantage of tying up capital in obtaining them, using significant resources in warehousing this supply, which is further compounded by the risk of perishability and obsolesce.  If one had a crystal ball with which one could predict the future, then the company could know how many requests there will be, day by day, for each of the items it sells, and therefore know how much of what should be on hand in each of its warehouses. Instead, one can model the future probabilistically (similar to what a weather forecaster does when saying that there is a 40% chance of showers tomorrow), and then one can cast the problem of making the optimal decisions for these inventory levels as a problem of maximizing the average profit that can be obtained (or minimizing the average costs incurred), where the notion of average is with respect to the randomness used to model our inability to exactly predict the future. This project has the goal of using past historical data as a means for modeling the predictions for future data, and then designing algorithms that produce provably near-optimal decisions based on this approximation.  This type of decision-making in the face of uncertainty arises in a wide range of application domains, from selling different classes of airline<br/>tickets for a portfolio of flight legs to manufacturing a suite of products that rely on overlapping sets of components. This project focuses on settings in which there are multiple stages of decision-making that must be made in the face of an evolving view of the predictions of future<br/>requirements. The aim is to provide tools to automate such decision-making with algorithms that are guaranteed to quickly produce reliable solutions.<br/><br/>

Rice	09/30/2011	$109,464.00		sigman@princeton.edu	Off. of Research & Proj. Admin.	Princeton	NJ	085442020	6092583090	GEO	1670	9189, EGCH	$0.00	In this project, researchers at the University of Southern California and Princeton University will investigate the link between non-local bacterial nitrate transport and regional nitrogen losses in oxygen deficient basins off the Southern California coast and regions of the Eastern Subtropical North Pacific. Recent studies suggest remarkably rapid benthic nitrate consumption in the Santa Barbara Basin (Sigman et al., 2003; Hammond et al., 2006). Yet, budgets for N, S and C fluxes in this basin may be only satisfied if a large fraction (up 100 % potentially) of nitrate uptake in SBB sediments does not involve the respiration of organic carbon, but instead is coupled to oxidation of sulfides. The bacteria Thioploca and Beggiatoa, found in this region, are known to accumulate up to 500 mM of nitrate intracellularly. They transport nitrate into the sediments, up to depths of tens of centimeters where nitrate is used for hydrogen sulfide oxidation. This non-local nitrate transport (within laminated sediments) clearly ?breaks? the rules of diagenetic sequence. Preliminary work in SBB and Santa Monica and San Pedro Basins produced geochemical and isotopic evidence which is consistent with bacterial transport and subsequent transformation of nitrate to dinitrogen (N2) at depth in the sediments.<br/><br/>The researchers on this project hypothesize that non-local bacterial transport of nitrate may be a significant but previously overlooked sink in the regional and global N budgets of oxygen deficient zones. They will (1) examine the geochemical framework favorable for non-local bacterial transport of nitrate; (2) determine the relative contribution of this process to net regional losses of fixed N; (3) identify and quantify the effects of this phenomenon on the '15N of nitrate in the overlying water column; and (4) investigate the possible coupling of microbial nitrate transport to other reactions that reduce nitrate, such as Anammox.<br/><br/>This project, which includes one long cruise and four brief cruises to San Pedro Basin, will provide a framework for potential involvement of USC and Princeton undergraduate and graduate students in oceanographic research. The tell-tale signs of nitrate-transporting bacteria have been and will continue to be a topic of interest in the ongoing International Geobiology summer course on nearby Catalina Island. Finally, this project will support the scientific development of a young female researcher who spear-head this proposal.

While the physical mechanism by which a single bacterium swims, pushing itself through the fluid with a flagella bundle that turns like a screw, is well understood, the equations of motion governing a suspension of bacteria have not been derived previously. In the proposed study, we will derive these equations starting from a fundamental description of bacteria-fluid interactions, solve the equations for several representative flows, and observe these flows experimentally. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: A bacteria cell exerts a drag force on the fluid while its flagella exert an equal and opposite force, leading to a force dipole which on average creates a pressure in the direction of mean cell orientation. This situation may be contrasted with a stretched polymer which exerts a tension in the direction of its orientation. In a weak shear flow, a bacterium orients with the extensional axis of the flow and reinforces the extensional motion. Thus, above a critical cell concentration, the suspension has a negative viscosity and a quiescent suspension will be unstable to the formation of spontaneous fluid motion. We believe that this instability explains previous experimental observations of vortical motions in systems of swimming bacteria. We plan to use particle tracking of both bacteria and passive colloidal particles to probe this instability. <br/><br/>The alignment of bacteria along streamlines in a strong shear flow will create a negative first normal stress difference (or streamline pressure) in contrast to the positive first normal stress difference (or streamline tension) for polymer solutions. Both non-Newtonian fluids can enhance mixing due to secondary flows caused by streamline curvature in a curved microfluidic channel, but, as we shall confirm, the vortices will be centered on the inside of a channel bend for bacteria and on the outside for a polymer solution. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The applications of our studies include a novel method to separate bacteria based on their chemotactic behavior, a new ?active? fluid for micro-fluidic mixing whose activity can be modulated by biochemical inputs, and insights into the manner in which cells disperse or collect themselves into clusters as they respond to biochemical cues. People have a natural curiosity about the collective behavior of living things. Our studies which link such collective behaviors to the principles of momentum and mass transport and kinetic theory descriptions of suspensions will provide a means to engage and inspire students to think about connections between biology and engineering. We will exploit these opportunities in our undergraduate and graduate curricula and in the Nanobiotechnology Center's outreach program for high school teachers.<br/>

Long<br/><br/>Title: Doctoral Dissertation Research: How do Voters Decide? Ethnicity and Performance in African Elections<br/><br/>0718782<br/><br/>Abstract<br/>On what bases do African citizens choose leaders in democratic elections?  African elections are typically understood as highly ethnic, where candidates appeal to voters by inciting ethnic fear or using selective incentives such as patronage to attract support from co-ethnics.  The study advances our understanding of African voting behavior by identifying when, where and in what ways ethnicity and performance matter, either separately or in conjunction.  Consequently, this will demonstrate whether politicians pursue policies, goods, and services directed at their own ethnic group or more broadly to the district or nation.  If ethnic hypotheses are correct, co-ethnics will be returned to office time and again and narrowly target policies towards their group.  If performance hypotheses are correct, poor performers will be thrown out of office and politicians will be encouraged to pursue policies targeted towards co-ethnics and non-ethnics alike.<br/>In order to understand whether and how ethnicity and performance matter to voting, this study proposes a post-election survey of Kenya's upcoming December 2007 election.  It will consist of randomly chosen voters from precincts in a nationally representative sample.  The survey will ask questions regarding ethnicity, evaluations of performance, and vote choice for candidates in local and national elections.  <br/>The study makes empirical and methodological improvements upon current studies by using novel individual level survey data.  Rather than postulate the effects of ethnicity or performance at the group level, the survey allows for robust and direct tests of these variables in determining an individual's vote.  Performing the study for local and national elections allows for separate tests using different electoral units that vary over a number of characteristics.  It provides a better measure of performance than extant studies, understood as the delivery of local public services that result from taxation.  Through randomization, the survey also avoids problems of selection bias that plague other studies.  Such data will allow me to test separate hypotheses concerning the independent effects of ethnicity and performance, as well as the ways in which the two interact. <br/>The broader impact of this project has important implications for development in multi-ethnic and poor countries.  The results of this study can provide politicians, policymakers and donors with critical information regarding the relationship between citizens and leaders over issues of ethnicity, performance, public services, and taxation.  If performance theories are correct, elections are the prime mechanism that induces accountability on the part of politicians.  These policies may in turn become the engine to sustained economic growth and development.  If ethnic theories are correct, we might expect skewed policy biases that are harmful for progress over the long-run. This is especially true at the local level, where scholars and policymakers increasingly view local government as the potential catalyst for development.<br/>

The variable area analysis capabilities (from approximately 200 im down to 10 im spot size) of this instrument make it ideal for the support of a wide range of cutting edge research topics. Seventeen faculty members whose existing and future programs will benefit greatly from the addition of this XPS on the Vanderbilt campus have been identified. Among the 17 faculty members we have 3 NSF Career award winners, two Presidential Early Career Awards for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE) winners, and two have been recognized by Vanderbilt University with awards for excellence in teaching. This award-winning group of faculty is diverse in many aspects. It consists of 6 Assistant, 4 Associate (early career), and 7 Full professors, with representatives from the departments of Chemical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Biomedical Engineering, Civil Engineering, Chemistry, and Physics. Five are women and one is African American.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit:<br/>The research that will benefit from having an XPS on campus is just as diverse as the faculty who will utilize the instrument. It falls into three broad categories: Inorganic Materials, Nanoparticulate Materials, and Biological Materials. Projects falling under the Inorganic Materials heading include electronic materials (gate dielectrics, SiC, diamond, and CZT), carbon/cement composites, and ceramics for extreme environments. Projects falling under the Nanoparticulate Materials heading include magneto optical thin films and nanoparticles for the development of fuel cell catalysts and solid-state white lighting. Projects falling into the Biological Materials include DNA-modified surfaces, biomimetic routes for solar energy conversion and metal oxide growth, bone-polymer composites, and nanocrystals to fight breast cancer. The link between all these projects is the Interdisciplinary Graduate Program in Materials Science, of which nearly all of the major users are affiliate faculty. Also, many of the major users are faculty of the Vanderbilt Institute of Nanoscale Science and Engineering (VINSE). A state-of-the-art XPS instrument will not only benefit the existing programs, but will greatly strengthen this multidisciplinary research center.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:<br/>The acquisition of this instrument will broadly impact graduate Materials Science education and training at both Vanderbilt University and Fisk University, a historically black institution. In 2004, Vanderbilt and Fisk were awarded an Integrative Graduate Education and Research Training grant.The Vanderbilt*Fisk Interdisciplinary Program for Research & Education in the Nanosciences is tied to the research activities of VINSE researchers at both universities. The students take courses together on both campuses. Scientists from Physical Electronics will work with the PI's to develop a yearly one-day workshop on XPS. Professors Laibinis, Jennings, and Rogers will develop a modular (5 weeks, 3 hours/week) course in XPS analysis to support the Vanderbilt*Fisk IGERT. The focus of this module will be on theory and basic instrument operation. In addition, they will develop a semester long course in Surface, Interface, and Thin Film characterization. Data analysis will be emphasized in both the modular and semester courses. Professor Rogers recently purchased a site license for the surface analysis software CASAXPS to support her research programs. Data from the XPS and her Auger electron spectrometer systems will be used to demonstrate course concepts, and students will be able to perform state-of-the-art data reduction using the CASAXPS software.

It will accomplish this by utilizing satellite observations from the CHAMP and GRACE satellites to derive total mass densities and cross-track winds from 2002 through 2008. These spacecraft data are particularly useful since observations are obtained almost continuously with better than 80-km resolution along the satellite track which extends from pole to pole. The database will be provided to the research community via the web, yielding a comprehensive view of space weather from solar cycle maximum through solar minimum. These datasets will then be used in a variety of other investigations. One of these will delineate and interpret the global magnetic storm response of the thermospheric densities, winds, and exospheric temperatures as a function of longitude, local time, and season. A similar study will be performed to elucidate the local time response of the density, winds, and exospheric temperatures for different levels of solar activity; this study includes an investigation of the relative contributions of the tides originating in the lower atmosphere relative to the tidal components forced in situ by solar EUV absorption. The dataset will also be used to investigate a variety of regional phenomena such as the equatorial ionization anomaly, the midnight temperature maximum, and wave 4 longitude structures recently observed in the ionosphere; these features can be examined for the global view of their seasonal, solar cycle, and magnetic activity dependences. The CHAMP satellite is scheduled to re-enter the atmosphere in 2009 and it may be possible to use data obtained during this period to derive vertical winds. The project will provide a cross-disciplinary training opportunity for graduate students in aerospace engineering and in space weather science and will help meet national needs in terms of training future engineers and scientists while addressing problems relevant to society such as orbital drag prediction and ionospheric effects on communication. It will also enable the research team to participate in the ESA mission GOCE which will further international collaborations. The space weather benefits include development of improved empirical density and wind models, validation and testing of first-principles models, conducting ion-neutral coupling studies using coincident orbital plane data from the DMSP satellites; and coordinated studies with data from the CNOFS satellite.

Cina of the University of Oregon, Eugene is supported by the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to develop and implement theoretical methods to study the dynamics of ultrafast processes in cryogenic solids, and wave-packet interferometry in complex systems. One project is designed to provide rigorous, comprehensive analysis and interpretation of ultrafast time-resolved optical signals from molecules embedded in low-temperature rare-gas matrices. Accurate simulations of nonlinear optical signals are underway using empirically and spectroscopically derived many-body electronic potential energy surfaces. Another focus is the calculation and interpretation of nonlinear wave-packet interferometry signals from systems exhibiting surface-crossing dynamics and multi-dimensional nuclear motion. The goal of this project is to explore state reconstruction and to provide amplitude-level interpretations for complicated dynamical systems, large molecules, and energy-transfer complexes. Close interaction between theory and experiment is planned to understand and interpret the results. This work is having a broader impact on the education and training of graduate and undergraduate students to frame and solve complex theoretical and computational problems. Scientific impacts include the development of computational tools capable of treating multi-dimensional chemical and biological systems. This research also has the potential for impact in the emerging area of quantum information processing

Device scaling of silicon transistors has been the fundamental basis for the phenomenal success of the semiconductor and electronics industry. While there have been significant accomplishments in scientific discovery in recent years at the single-device level at the nanoscale, a major gap exists between such single-device-level results and the research required to harness the science into practical design technologies competitive with silicon technologies at the end of device scaling. This project uses an interdisciplinary approach to overcome fundamental challenges by combining novel CNFET-based robust imperfection-immune design and automation techniques together with new CNFET modeling and processing techniques. The ideas developed in this project will be experimentally validated through working CNFET-based circuits. This research program also integrates research and education required to explore novel, nanoscale electronic designs through graduate and undergraduate training, and public education on nanotechnology.
0720041	Doctoral Dissertation in Political Science: Political Competition and the Regulation of Foreign Direct Investment	SES	POLITICAL SCIENCE	08/01/2007	08/05/2007	Karen Remmer	NC	Duke University	Standard Grant	Brian D. Humes	07/31/2008	$11,786.00	Sinziana Popa	remmer@duke.edu	2200 W. Main St, Suite 710	Durham	NC	277054010	9196843030	SBE	1371	9179, SMET	$0.00	The research analyzes the effect of regime type on the choice of policies regulating the entry and operation of foreign companies. Despite wide consensus that foreign direct investment (FDI) contributes to economic development, foreign investment regulations in developing countries range from open to very restrictive. Some countries welcome foreign firms with straightforward regulations and generous investment incentives. By contrast, other governments keep in place regulatory barriers and cumbersome requirements that deter the entry of foreign companies. This research investigates these policy differences. It draws upon economic insights into the distributional consequences of FDI and a theory of political coalitions in differ political regimes to argue that democratic countries are more likely to adopt policies that foster foreign investment than non-democratic regimes.<br/> The theoretical rationale is relatively straightforward: dictatorships, which have small winning coalitions, use government policies to cater to the interests of those controlling enough instruments of power to keep the leader in office. These are members of the business elite, the army, or the party leadership in one-party systems, and are likely to be part of the wealthier group in society. By contrast, democratic regimes, which must maintain the support of large winning coalitions, choose policies that benefit the majority of the population?owners of labor. Since FDI inflows benefit the owners of factors of production that complement foreign capital and hurt the owners of factors of production for which FDI is a substitute. This theoretical framework and a formal model make specific predictions about the effect of regime type on each of the three different dimensions of FDI regulation?the regulation of foreign entry, taxation, and incentive programs?and on variation among sectoral policies. This research tests these hypotheses on the basis of statistical analysis using an original dataset on postcommunist nations and the in-depth examination of two theoretically important cases, Croatia and Belarus.<br/> The research contributes to four bodies of literature in political science, as well as to the very limited pool of quantitative data on national policies regulating FDI. It involves an intensive effort to collect and code information on FDI restrictions, taxation, and incentives for 28 postcommunist countries between 1990-2005. This dataset is the first to code incentives for FDI, as well as the first to combine information on FDI restrictions, taxation, and incentives. The dataset will be instrumental for future research investigating determinants of policy choice and the effect of government regulations on economic outcomes.<br/> At the theoretical level, the project has implications for four strands of research. First, it advances the debate over the nexus between regime type and economic growth by emphasizing policy choice as a mediating variable between political institutions and economic performance. Second, the research challenges many conclusions in the literature on economic reform, which suggest that reform is promoted by authoritarian regimes capable of overriding the opposition of concentrated interests that stand to lose from policy change. In contrast, this project advances the proposition that democracies have an inherent bias toward adopting policies that benefit large and diffuse groups in society despite the organized opposition of special interests. Third, the project advances research on the political economy of postcommunist transformations by emphasizing the political sources of policy differences among transition countries. Fourth, the project contributes to the emerging literature on regime type and FDI by advancing a series of hypotheses about the impact of political institutions on policy choice and exploring those hypotheses on the basis of an original dataset of FDI regulations. <br/> Finally, the study will also interest policy-makers who shape countries'' policy framework regulating the entry and operations of foreign firms. The FDI regulations dataset will contain a wide range of detailed information that allows for an evaluation of strategic policy choices and best practices in this policy domain.

The TEC measurements are used to evaluate changes that occur during magnetic storms relative to a quite-time baseline, and TEC variations are correlated with both storm strength and storm phase. TEC data derived when there are independent measurements of vertical plasma drift at the magnetic equator are specifically targeted, so that correlations between changes in the vertical drift and changes in TEC are established. The research is carried out in three phases. In Phase 1 the oversatellite electron content (OSEC) is cataloged as function of satellite position and time. In Phase 2, computerized ionospheric tomography is used to invert the OSEC data, producing 2-dimensional images of the topside (including the F-region peak) plasma distribution. In Phase 3 the OSEC images are ingested into a three-dimensional ionospheric data assimilation algorithm, along with other ground-based and space-based plasma data, providing a global, three-dimensional description of the plasma distribution from the F2 ionospheric peak through the topside.

One challenge is to obtain an accurate overview of a large text collection, such as the public comments collected in ''''''''notice and comment'''''''' rulemaking. No single tool currently provides a sufficiently diversified picture of such a corpus, and no adequate theory exists to help people explore and form a deep and nuanced understanding of such a text collection. This research seeks to develop a computational framework that allows further exploration of this problem from multiple, integrated perspectives. All the assembled perspectives will be brought together into a single overall supra-document structure that is dynamically constructed under user guidance. In this structure, hierarchical topic clusters will be cross-linked by opinion and argumentation links, using two classes of text analysis engines: one for topics and subtopics, and the other for argument structures. The research team will design, develop, build, and systematically test an overall text exploration framework, an application to support federal regulation writersone called the Rule-Writers Workbench. There is a strong collaboration with Federal government officials who will provide data and participate in user testing. The three PIs have successfully collaborated on a related project under previous NSF funding. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: This is a sustainable collaboration between computer science and political/social science research, rooted in a challenging and important real world application and informed by years of end user research. Dynamic, user-driven subtopic definition and clustering algorithms coupled with<br/>language modeling are an innovative yet reachable set of goals. The framework to be developed will be grounded in the humanities disciplines'' expertise in rhetoric, discourse structure, and subjectivity.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The Rule-Writers Workbench will allow federal government regulation writers to employ a suite of technical tools that perform independent analyses of public responses to proposed regulations, including near-duplicate detection and clustering, user-based topic selection from dynamically extracted keywords, opinion identification, and subtopic clustering. These capabilities will open new avenues for federal comment analysis.

Dedicated motherboard-level regulators increase the form factor of portable electronics. This project is developing a novel paradigm in which power regulation circuitry is designed synergistically with the computational elements of system, thereby reducing or eliminating the need for off-chip regulation. The focal point of the research is the development of models, design methodologies, and management techniques that allow low power high-performance SoCs to be directly connected to an energy source, enabling the next step in system integration.<br/><br/>The project seeks to develop integrated, programmable, on-chip switching regulators that leverage novel packaging technology to provide noise free supply voltages at high-efficiency. In addition, on-chip regulation improves the feasibility of fine-grained voltage domains. The project examines unique cross-boundary system optimizations spanning both software-level task management and regulation hardware design. It is developing integrated operating system and hardware methods to limit peak current, improve slew rate demands, and reduce voltage ripples through balanced scheduling. In special cases, it may be possible to completely remove regulation circuitry and allow the operating system to adapt computation under deregulatedgradually declining battery voltages.<br/><br/>The removal of dedicated off-chip regulation from embedded systems has broad potential for commercial and social impact by enabling new generations of compact, reliable embedded devices, such as consumer electronics and medical devices. This project provides educational benefits through training of graduate students and incorporation of resulting advanced material in courses.
0704213	The Space of Shapes: A mathematical approach with applications to computer vision	DMS	GEOMETRIC ANALYSIS, COMPUTATIONAL MATHEMATICS	08/15/2007	07/09/2009	David Mumford	RI	Brown University	Continuing grant	Christopher W. Stark	07/31/2010	$247,657.00		mumford@dam.brown.edu	BOX 1929	Providence	RI	029129002	4018632777	MPS	1265, 1271	0000, 9150, 9263, OTHR	$0.00	Object recognition tasks in computer vision and particularly medical imaging, require a theory of shape. There are many mathematical theories of geometry- Euclid's theory of triangles, Gauss's theory of the obstructions to flattening a surface, Poincare's theory of the most abstract properties unique to a sphere. But none of these seem to have captured what humans mean when they say this object is heart-shaped but that one is kidney-shaped. Automated analysis of medical scans requires that these issues be addressed. Humans have no difficulty answering questions about how similar two shapes are. This suggests two types of mathematical models. On the one hand, one might define precisely a measure of dissimilarity of two shapes, a so-called metric on the set of all shapes. On the other, one might define a probability distribution whose values represent the probability that one shape is likely to belong to the same category as the first. Both constructions are, however, not simple extensions of known mathematics because the set of all shapes is infinite dimensional: this means that any given shape can be wiggled or stretched in infinitely many distinct ways, that no finite set of numbers can fully describe any given shape. Thus new mathematics is needed to create the tools to work with shapes. It is hoped that the ideas behind this study may impact work in recognizing, identifying and comparing the objects present in any type of imaging such as MRI's and CAT-scans.<br/><br/>More precisely, this study starts from the observation that a shape (a closed surface in 3-space or a curve in the plane) can be viewed as a point in an infinite dimensional manifold. Even though the space of shapes is not linear, i.e. two shapes cannot, in any natural way, be added, the set of small deformations of a shape does form a vector space, namely the vector space of normal vector fields along the shape. Having a manifold, differential geometry can be used to define and study metrics on the space of shapes. Recent work has shown that a rich family of Riemannian metrics exists on this space with many different properties. Each one has its own geodesic equations and curvature tensor which have strikingly different properties. This project proposes to study two questions in particular: (a) the curvature for the Riemannian metric inherited from Sobolev norms on the diffeomorphism group of the ambient space and (b) the relationship between the features of the plane curve and its representation in the arguably most natural metric, the Weil-Petersson metric. We also seek to study the probability distributions on the space of shapes obtained as the marginals of diffusion processes associated to these metrics. We finally propose to make a database of scanned 2D shapes on which to compare the many metrics which have been proposed and to study clustering and the fitting of probability models to data. At present, there seem to be several good candidate metrics for applications so a comparative study is very important.

Modeling methods ranging from ab initio atomistic calculations to enriched continuum models will be employed to enhance understanding of flexoelectricity at the nanoscale and provide guidelines to select materials and engineer highly optimized, apparently piezoelectric nanostructures with the requisite symmetry, topology and size. The different topologies will be fabricated by precisely controlling the dispersion of suitably shaped nanoparticles in a polymer matrix (from soft elastomers to hard thermoplastics and thermosets) with external fields (flow, electrical & magnetic) as a means to tune the symmetry and provide the necessary 3-dimensional arrangement of the nanoinclusions. <br/><br/>The expected benefits of the program will be both educational and societal. Anticipated research outcomes are an independence from Nature's limited selection of active electromechanical materials and an ability to design multifunctionality by assembling arbitrary non-active material combinations. Apart from resolutions of fundamental scientific questions related to piezoelectricity at the nanoscale, technological applications of the proposed research are anticipated in next generation actuators, sensors, MEMs and NEMs with consequent impact on diverse industries such as, Electronics, Space and Aerospace, Biomedical, Defense among others. The educational impact is that undergraduate and graduate students will be trained in emerging and interdisciplinary scholarly research. Research and education will be integrated by focusing on the education, outreach and recruitment through (1) Undergraduate summer research opportunities, (2) High School outreach using our existing NSF RET, REU and AGEP, and (3) Middle/High School student demonstrations. Research findings will be incorporated into courses, and broadly disseminated through conference presentations, scholarly publications, and the PIs's websites.

Microarrays, which perform large-scale multiplexing on two-dimensional substrates, have transformed biomedical research by enabling genome wide investigation of genetic variation and function. Micro-barcode particles are poised to translate this capability to a three-dimensional, free-solution format, greatly expanding the possibilities of this powerful technology. Rod-shaped metallic particles with 0.25 to 1 micron diameters and lengths of 2 to 10 microns (Nanoplex, Menlo Park, CA) can be grown with metallic stripes that encode on the order of 10 bits of information. Each micro-barcode particle carries an identifiable signature, analogous to a conventional barcode, that serves as a mechanism for tracking molecular probes, such as oligonucleotides, attached to the particle surface. Many such particles then be mixed, reacted with a sample, and detected in parallel in a single chamber or fluidic channel. We propose to develop an automated particle flow control, electricfield alignment, sorting, and readout technology applicable to massively-parallel oligonucleotide synthesis. We will build and demonstrate custom-designed microfluidic devices, that for the first time, will control, read, and sort micro-barcode particles in microfluidic systems. Critical to the device design and optimization, will be the development of generalized electro-kinetic models that account for particle Brownian motion, electrophoresis (including mono- and multi-pole electrokinetic effects), hydrodynamic forces, and sedimentation in confined geometries. These models will be in the form of large-scale multi-particle simulations using novel numerical codes being developed jointly with the experiments. The large-scale simulations will allow us to accurately predict the location, velocity and orientation of the particles as they travel through the device, and thus quantitatively predict device performance.<br/><br/>We have performed preliminary experiments in which we align and subsequently track the positions and orientations of cylindrical particles 5 microns long and 0.25 microns in diameter under settling conditions in both DC and AC electric fields. In additional to the initial experiments, we have already developed simulation tools to model the sedimentation of a large number of Brownian rods at low Reynolds number with electrophoretic alignment and particle-induced electrophoretic flow in periodic systems, thus determining the initial flow parameter regimes that we will ultimately examine in detail. The broader research impact and intellectual merit of our work includes a fundamental understanding of a number of unsolved problems in suspension mechanics which directly bear on the performance of these barcode readers. These issues include developing our understanding of (a) the rheology of rod-like polymer and rod-like colloidal particle suspensions from dilute through semi-dilute including ICEP interactions; (b) the effect of ICEP flow on the collective phenomena associated with the simultaneous sedimentation and mean flow of fiber suspensions; (c) the action of shear-induced diffusion on the center of mass motion of the rod-like particles; and (d) the collective dynamics of rod suspensions in non-local flows, i.e. those in which the mean flow scale is on the order of the length of the rod. Indeed, even though these principles are intrinsic to the science of the microfluidics of complex fluids, many of the combinations of these nonlinear physics will be examined for the first time. Moreover, the broad educational impact associated with using large scale computing for design of microfluidic devices will be developed as an integral part of two summer internships for high school science teachers via a partnership with Stanford's Summer Research Program for Science Teachers. These internships will include faculty at one or two Title I schools. One internship will be associated with the experimental aspects of the research and the other with the computational design aspects. The internships will allow the faculty members to work closely with the PIs and graduate students and form a working group to understand the applications of microfluidic technology and advanced computing as an engineering design tool, and thereafter take experimental expertise, demonstrations and computer simulations back to the classroom.

While some of these threats are common in desktop systems, the general-purpose nature of a desktop and the commodity nature of the components comprising it prevent the deployment of meaningful architectural countermeasures. Such restrictions are less stringent in embedded systems, permitting the investigation of new security approaches, covering all aspects of system architecture design. However, such systems are severely resource-constrained in processing and battery capacities. Thus, purely software security solutions can overwhelm these capacities. Providing a secure implementation requires security measures that span various components in the system-on-chip (SoC), including hardware and software.<br/><br/>The aim of this research is to develop design methodologies to obtain efficient hardware/software implementations that can facilitate secure program execution or implement a given security policy in embedded systems. The first objective includes developing hardware/software design methodologies to support trusted platform module (TPM) functionality in resource-constrained embedded systems. TPM acts as a root of trust for the system that contains it, providing capabilities for secure storage, secure reporting of platform configuration measurements, and cryptographic key generation, among other functions. It is reported that by 2010, shipments of TPMs will reach 250 million, giving impetus to this research. The second objective includes design of a security-aware SoC communication architecture that can enforce a system-level security policy. The third objective includes developing techniques to facilitate the deployment of type-safe software

The Ocean Biogeographic Information System - Spatial Ecological Analysis of Megavertebrate Populations (OBIS-SEAMAP) program was designed specifically to make such information available to the research, education and management communities. Over the past four years OBIS-SEAMAP has successfully developed a multi-function information system to provide critical data to scientists, managers and educators under the NOPP program. <br/><br/>The PIs request renewal funding for OBIS-SEAMAP to continue to provide information system services and to expand both the scope and depth of our program to better meet the increasingly complex demands facing the ocean science and management communities. They plan to focus new efforts on developing a more technically advanced and fully interoperable marine animal information management system within the context of the emerging integrated ocean observing system. The OBIS-SEAMAP system will continue to be a leading prototype for the development of new technologies and data delivery systems for CoML and the International Ocean Observing System (IOOS). <br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/><br/>The project provides both the analytical tools and an information dissemination system to support fundamental research and applied protected species management initiatives. All data, tools and services developed under this program will be rapidly disseminated in an open environment through a data portal. The PIs will develop novel web services approaches to allow for dynamic linkage of information from the information system into other applications in a seamless manner. They are actively designing the products and outcomes of this project to fulfill important societal and research needs.

The research program of Prof. Daunert focuses on the development of whole-cell sensing systems. Whole-cell sensing systems are ideal analytical tools in biomedical analysis as well as in environmental monitoring due to their sensitivity, selectivity, and rapidity. Their potential would further be enhanced if they could be used effectively for on-site applications. In that regard, there is a need for methods that improve the shelf-life and transportability of whole-cell biosensing systems, and allow for their adaptation to miniaturized systems for field analysis. To that end, Prof. Daunert and her students will develop a method based on the use of bacterial spores for the long-term maintenance of the viability and activity of bacterial sensing cells, and integrate such preserved sensor cells into portable systems for on-site sensing. Bacterial spores were chosen as the protective component of whole-cell sensors since they are a resting form of life that exhibit long-term resistance towards extreme environmental conditions, and are able to resume full metabolic activity when properly stimulated. Specifically, Prof. Daunert and her students will develop genetically engineered whole-cell sensing systems for various target analytes using spore-forming bacteria. They will then produce spores as means of preservation, storage and transport of the sensing cells. Subsequently, they will incorporate these dormant sensors into a miniaturized compact disk-like microfluidic platform. Additionally, they will immobilize them on paper strips as a simple ready-to-use configuration. Both systems can be transported to the field, where the spores can be germinated to vegetative cells and employed for sensing. Prof. Daunert envisions that this new strategy could expand the use of whole-cell biosensors for on-site analysis, not only in mild environments, but also in environments and applications in which they could not be employed previously. These include extreme environments, such as deserts, polar regions and space, as well as the remote sensing of chemical warfare agents used for bioterrorism. The impact of this work could be strong in developing countries, where rapid, simple and inexpensive analytical tools for monitoring human health and the environment are needed, and limitations are often posed by unfavorable climate conditions and inadequate distribution and storage facilities. The project will provide excellent training opportunities to students in a cutting edge multidisciplinary research area of high societal impact.

The major users will make use of the new instrument in the following research areas: a) Chemistry of the lanthanide and actinide elements, b) Effects of non-covalent interactions on metal mediated transformations, c) Redox-active ligands for small molecule activation and catalysis, d) Invention of new methods for chemical synthesis of complex molecules of biomedical importance, e) New methods for stereoselective carbon-carbon bond-formation.<br/><br/>X-ray diffractometers are widely used to allow prompt and definitive characterization of reaction products whose characterization by other means is often difficult or ambiguous. They provide accurate and precise measurements of the full three-dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles, as well as the spatial arrangement of the molecule relative to the neighboring molecules. The results of these studies contribute to a broad range of areas, including inorganic, organic, organometallic, biological, and materials chemistry. The new instrument will be a resource for local academic and industrial laboratories and will contribute significantly to the Chemistry Department's educational and outreach programs.

It is based on an Image Intensified CMOS sensor (ICMOS) and a high-speed confocal scanner, which are designed to meet the following specifications: 1) High-speed (< 1 ms/frame), mega-pixel imaging with single-photon sensitivity. This is the same sensitivity as an EMCCD (Electron Multiplying CCD) but at one hundred times faster frame rate. 2) High-speed (< 1 ms/frame) confocal scanning for a single x-y focal plane. In addition, capability to scan in depth (z) up to 100 microns in 30 msec, resulting in a ''true 4D movie'' at video frame rate. 3) High-speed (< 10 ms/frame) FLIM (Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscope) with < 100 psec lifetime resolution for a single x-y focal plane. This is a similar lifetime resolution as conventional scanning confocal microscopes but with a frame rate that is one hundred times faster. It will enable a ''true 4D FLIM movie'' at video frame rate. 4) Video-rate (~30 ms/frame) FLIM with true spectrum analysis for a single x-y focal plane. This new microscope may revolutionize the way millisecond time-scale phenomena are visualized in all biological systems, spanning from single molecules, single cells, and neural networks (such as the brain), to in vivo imaging of tissue in animals. <br/><br/>In addition to the scientific benefit of this new microscope, this award will contribute to multi-disciplinary education of students, at both the graduate and undergraduate level, at the forefront of biology, chemistry, physics, and engineering.

We know what types of morphologies can be formed from a large variety of starting recipes, and what kinds of properties these nanocomposites exhibit. However, relatively little is known about how nanocomposite morphologies reach their characteristic forms during processing, nor how these structures behave under large-scale deformation to fracture. This knowledge, which is needed to complete comprehensive modeling, can be provided by conducting in-situ studies of nanocomposite processing and deformation. This Materials World Network team examines this topic using in-situ nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques. The team consists of Johannes Leisen and Haskell Beckham from the Georgia Institute of Technology, with expertise in solid-state NMR spectroscopy and polymer science, in partnership with Ulrich Scheler of the Leibniz Institute for Polymer Research (Dresden, Germany), with expertise in rheological-NMR. The Georgia Tech group conducts the deformation studies while the Leibniz group conducts the processing studies. PLS nanocomposites based on polypropylene and poly(ethylene terephthalate) are prepared using a synthetic fluoromica nanoscopic filler. These PLS nanocomposites are examined by a variety of advanced solid-state NMR methods while under uniaxial deformation, with an emphasis on the morphological and dynamical changes occurring at the interface between matrix polymer and nanoscopic filler. Simultaneously, these materials are examined by NMR under shear using high-temperature rheo-NMR, with an emphasis on flow-pattern evolution (e.g., shear-induced ordering), filler dispersion, and modulation of molecular mobilities. Findings from these studies are expected to significantly enhance our understanding of how the structure/property relationships in PLS nanocomposites evolve under technically relevant processing conditions. With this knowledge, new PLS nanocomposites with superior properties can be developed efficiently and cost-effectively.<br/><br/>The proposed research has broad implications for an emerging industry devoted to manufacturing of PLS nanocomposites. Research in the field of PLS nanocomposites is pursued strongly overseas. The proposed research will therefore contribute toward the competitiveness of the U.S. in this emerging field. The international aspect of this research offers a unique learning experience for the involved graduate students by offering them the opportunity of extended research stays in the partner country.<br/><br/>This award is co-funded with the Office of International Science and Engineering.

Szekely	07/31/2011	$249,999.00	Cidambi Srinivasan, M. Pinar Menguc	RJCharn2@aol.com	109 Kinkead Hall	Lexington	KY	405260001	8592579420	MPS	1269	0000, 7237, OTHR	$0.00	This three-year project advances the statistical field of functional data analysis by rigorously developing a new compound estimation paradigm for simultaneously estimating a mean response and several of its derivatives from noisy data. A hybrid between local modeling and global modeling, compound estimation circumvents the difficulties associated with local averaging (e.g., kernel), local modeling (e.g., local regression), and global modeling (e.g., spline) approaches. These difficulties include: the empirical disparity between asymptotic theory and finite-sample performance in local averaging; the pointwise character of local modeling, along with the incompatibilities between mean response estimates and derivative estimates in that setting; and, the unrealistic assumptions tacitly imposed in global modeling, such as there being three nonzero derivatives with discontinuities in the third derivative. Compound estimation is particularly promising for problems in which physical phenomena are described by differential equations, problems in which modeling velocities and accelerations is of scientific importance, and pattern recognition problems in which features of higher-order derivatives can be exploited for classification. One such pattern recognition problem has remained an outstanding challenge in nanoscale engineering: can the configuration of nanosize metallic particles, agglomerates, and structures on or near a surface be inferred from surface wave scattering data? If so, then a major hurdle to building real-time diagnostic tools in nanoscale engineering can be overcome, thereby advancing future nanomanufacturing efforts. Compound estimation offers a solution to this pattern recognition problem, as mean response estimates and derivative estimates from surface wave scattering data can be employed to objectively determine the most plausible configurations of nanosize particles. Although there is a wealth of underlying mathematics, the principal motivation for compound estimation is practical: to provide tractable yet realistic descriptions of the possibly complicated relationships among variables of scientific interest. Many applications are envisioned, including studies of: human growth and development patterns in biology; temporal trajectories for infectious disease incidence in public health; dose-response relationships for pharmacological treatments in medicine; stock market and gross domestic product trends in economics; and, the behavior of nanosize particles in engineering. This three-year project gives particular attention to the last application, both to guide the development of compound estimation and to address an important scientific problem in its own right. There is a crucial need for advanced instrumentation allowing real-time on-line diagnostics of chemical and physical processes in nanoscale engineering; compound estimation, through its solution to a pattern recognition problem, can help to create the eyes and brain for such diagnostics. <br/><br/>Theoretical and methodological developments in compound estimation, along with empirical findings, will be published in appropriate venues and presented to local, regional, and national audiences. User-friendly software will be made freely available online. This project will positively impact graduate and undergraduate education at the University of Kentucky, through both the direct involvement of five students during its three-year course and its visibility to incoming or prospective students as an example of exciting multidisciplinary research. Finally, the investigative team's connections with the Appalachian Math and Science Program and the Umbrella Program on Nanoscale Engineering will be utilized to raise undergraduate and high school student awareness of and appreciation for statistics and applications.

The research project is to advance a nonparametric likelihood approach that retains both the original meaning and the inferential power of Fisher's likelihood, and at the same time to construct estimating functions geared towards point estimators and Wald-type confidence intervals. The research studies semiparametric models for two-sample and regression problems in the absence and in the presence of missing data. The project also investigates statistical tools for causal inference in longitudinal studies with time-dependent treatments and confounders. The investigator's education plan involves designing a course on nonparametric likelihood and estimating functions with applications to semiparametric models and causal inference; supervising students with various backgrounds; establishing a causal inference working group as a research and educational platform; and organizing causal inference workshops for researchers and students to facilitate communications and collaborations.<br/><br/>The research will improve the validity and accuracy of inferences about environmental exposures, medical treatments, behavioral interventions among others in environmental, biomedical, and socioeconomic studies. The educational activities will help students from various backgrounds and researchers from various disciplines to acquire state-of-the-art statistical ideas and methods for empirical investigation and discovery.

Over 200 years of research has demonstrated that the Early Mesozoic age portion of this classic section presents an unparalleled record of biotic, tectonic, and climatic evolution of western Pangea. However, despite its rich scientific heritage and depth and intensity of current research, there is a striking lack of temporal and paleogeographic resolution that prevents integration with the global record.<br/><br/>We are organizing an international workshop too be held November 13-16, 2007 in St. George Utah, that will formulate a focused coring program in and off the Colorado Plateau with the goal of recovering, using core obtained from multiple localities, the complete Lower Mesozoic section in this classic area. This NSF-funded component compliments funds committed by DOSECC for this workshop. Such a modest coring project, concentrated on this time-stratigraphic interval on the Colorado Plateau, coupled with coring over the lower part this target interval off the Plateau, would provide quintessential continuous reference sections to place the regional and global events of more than 60 million years of Earth History in a precise chronostratigraphic and paleogeographic context that has the potential to revolutionize understanding of Pangean chronology, paleogeography, paleoclimate, tectonic and biotic evolution.

To achieve this goal, the project takes the following steps: (1) develop new query models for integrated queries over live and historical data; (2) develop new algorithms that effectively match new events with similar past observations; (3) develop a new continuous query engine that effectively supports the new query model (the engine includes a partitioned stream data store, a scheduler for fair and incremental historical query execution, new operators for merging historical data with data streams, and mechanisms for user-feedback); and (4) evaluate the practicality and performance of the system on data traces from real application domains. <br/><br/>Project funds support the training of PhD students. However, the project includes a large system development component that serves to train both graduate and undergraduate students in research and systems building. The result of this project will provide a new type of continuous processing engine that will better support monitoring applications in domains ranging from computer system monitoring, to network monitoring, and sensor-based environment monitoring. Such large-scale monitoring applications are critical for enterprises that operate at large scales. These enterprises need to carefully monitor their infrastructures to effectively handle and diagnose failures and deliver high-quality services to their customers. The software and technical papers resulting from this project will be disseminated through the project website(http://data.cs.washington.edu/moirae/moirae.shtml).

Information about the left/right location of a sound source is provided by the differences of time-of-arrival and sound level between the signals reaching the left and right ears. However, these between-ear differences are insufficient to specify front/rear location or up/down location. Some information about those dimensions can be provided through the outer ears' direction-dependent filtering, but a listener can take a more active role in localization by moving the head: Dynamic information is provided by the relation between head motion and the resulting changes in inter-aural differences. <br/><br/>With support of the National Science Foundation, Dr. Ewan Macpherson will investigate the effectiveness of the information provided by head motion, and the way it interacts with other information about sound location. Normal-hearing listeners will attempt to localize real and synthesized sound sources, both while the head is stationary and while the head is in motion. The project will extend knowledge of listeners' use of dynamic cues for vertical-plane localization. Dr. Macpherson will also use a novel experimental head-movement paradigm, which will permit detailed examination of the interplay of static and dynamic information. This project will facilitate the integration of research and education by involving undergraduate students as partners in the laboratory. New equipment acquired and software developed to carry out the project will greatly enhance the research capabilities at the Kresge Hearing Research Institute at the University of Michigan.

Humes	08/31/2008	$11,999.00		ostrom@indiana.edu	509 E 3RD ST	Bloomington	IN	474013654	8128550516	SBE	1371	9179, SMET	$0.00	One of the biggest obstacles to successful democratic and economic transition in post-communist societies is low levels of trust and weak institutions (Gibson 2001). Recent academic debate questions what policy response is most appropriate to ameliorate these problems. Specifically, some question the efficacy of building trust-relations by investing in civil society programs (Cook et al. 2005). This critique argues that strong government institutions, such as contract law, can substitute for low levels of trust. <br/>It is widely believed that low levels of trust are a major impediment in rural Bulgaria (Theesfeld 2005). Still, we know little about the precise levels of trust in the general population. Koford (2003) has found that Bulgarian students are actually more trusting than American students. Unfortunately students have little experience under communism and may not adequately reflect the general populations' trusting behavior. Rural Bulgarians, for example, seem reticent to engage in cooperative endeavors where trust is required (Theesfeld 2004; Hanisch 2003).<br/>These questions are examined by conducting 8 trust game experiments in the Bulgarian cities of Sofia and Plovdiv. Participants for these experiments will be recruited on a structured quota sample to encompass a wide age demographic. A baseline experiment of a trusting decision with a private donation will be followed by a treatment in which the trust decision is framed as a common property withdrawal. <br/>This research will significantly add to our understanding of trust in transition societies by (1) examining levels of trust among a broad demographic of Bulgarians in a theoretically and empirically rigorous manner and (2) testing the effects of experience under communism on levels of trust. The effects of other institutional settings will also be examined.<br/>This research will promote teaching, training, and learning by the inclusion and training of Bulgarian researchers and graduate students. They will help in recruitment and conducting of experiments and have shown a great enthusiasm for future collaborative efforts and the implementation of research results into their own future teaching. Underrepresented groups, specifically older and rural Bulgarians, absent from the past trust game experiments conducted by Koford (2003), will be recruited for these experiments. Results of this research will be presented at professional conferences and submitted to peer-reviewed journals. The research will also provide insight to the policymaking community in Bulgaria and other post-communist countries.

Kumar , Saroj Nayak , Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute<br/>Troy, NY<br/>Azar Alizadeh, General Electric Global Research Center<br/>Niskayuna, NY.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The nano-scale related project develops predictive multiscale simulation tools for modeling the synthesis of individual nanodots and their subsequent ordering into supramolecular assemblies. The work builds on the PIs current GOALI grant which successfully developed equilibrium mutiscale simulation approaches for this problem. Here, they address the difficult challenge of incorporating the effects of two crucial (non-equilibrium) experimental variables which are routinely used to control nanodot shape, size and assembly: these are kinetic control, and assembly driven by lattice mismatch between a substrate and an overlayer. These simulations are critically benchmarked against experiments<br/>to be performed by General Electric. The PI quantitatively models these<br/>different strategies for synthesizing quantum dot arrays since these nanomaterials have a broad range of potential applications, e.g., sensors for<br/>early detection of diseases, photonic band gap materials, zeolites, and molecular<br/>computers. The development of multiscale simulation approach is essential for two reasons. First, these synthesis methods involve self-assembly which span a variety of length [and hence time] scales, from the molecular [nm and fs] to the macroscopic [m and s]. Second, since current synthesis routes were developed by empirical methods, predictive strategies for creating novel materials with desired structures are missing. This is, perhaps, the biggest bottleneck to their broad-based use, a shortcoming we explicitly address in this work.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: The availability of these tools will directly aid in the development of new, generally applicable paradigms for synthesizing nanostructured materials which are relevant to a variety of interdisciplinary contexts that cross the boundaries of physics, chemistry, biology, and materials science. In addition to the education of our students [both at RPI and GE, especially during their<br/>summer internships at GE], the PIs have developed a new course highlighting the importance of multiscale simulations.

One type of problems concerns the motion of a particle in a random force field. We shall prove that the position, velocity, and energy of the particle, when scaled appropriately, converge, as time tends to infinity, to certain limiting processes. The limiting processes will be described explicitly in terms of the distribution of the force field. We shall also study measures carried by random velocity fields and describe their limiting behavior as time tends to infinity. Another set of problems concerns random perturbations of Hamiltonian flows. We shall strive to obtain a description of the effective behavior of randomly perturbed Hamiltonian flows on compact symplectic manifolds. A separate part of the proposal is devoted to an inverse problem for Gibbs fields. We shall prove that there always exist Gibbs fields with prescribed correlation functions, provided that the correlation functions satisfy certain consistency conditions. <br/><br/>Most of the proposed problems naturally arise in the study of various phenomena in physics, oceanography, theory of turbulence, and statistical mechanics. Consider, for example, a particle moving in a force field, such as a charged particle in an electro-magnetic field. We intend to describe the behavior of the particle (such as its position, velocity and energy) based on the probabilistic properties of the field. The main assumption is that the time at which the particle is observed is much larger than the typical size of the force field. We shall also study the transport properties of random flows. One could think of a pollutant carried by atmospheric currents as a physical model for this type of problems. Based on the probabilistic properties of the flow, one wishes to describe the long time behavior of the substance carried by it. Many results in this direction have been obtained be several groups of researchers under various simplifying assumptions, such as the periodicity of the flow. We shall study the problem for a large class of physically relevant flows.

Hoogland<br/>The evolution of polyandry in the white-tailed prairie dog, cynomys leucurus.<br/>IOS-0717097<br/><br/><br/>Polyandry, or multiple mating by females, is common in animals but the function of this behavior is poorly understood. Because mating involves costs such as increased exposure to diseases and parasites, the evolution and maintenance of polyandry are puzzling. Polyandry within six colonies of white-tailed prairie dogs at the Arapaho National Wildlife Refuge in Colorado will be studied. The specific goal over the next year will be to develop and optimize biochemical techniques for the assignment of paternity for those females that mate with more than one male. Accurate assignment of paternity is pivotal for investigating several hypotheses about how polyandry might evolve. Many undergraduate students are involved in this research. The project provides information about prairie dogs to new media and to the public. The research results will be useful to the State and Federal agencies that set policies concerning the preservation of this species.
0747783	Distributed Adaptive Systems: Feedback Control with Evolutionary Games	ECCS	CONTROL, NETWORKS, & COMP INTE	07/01/2007	08/22/2008	Jeff Shamma	GA	Georgia Tech Research Corporation	Standard Grant	Radhakisan S.

The proposed work stems from recent innovations at UCLA on the role of feedback control in the<br/>game theoretic framework of distributed learning. This recent work has overcome long standing perceived<br/>obstacles in game theoretic learning and opens new opportunities for distributed system design.<br/>The proposed research will emphasize underlying mathematical models of multiagent learning. The<br/>research directions to be explored are:<br/>Advanced analysis of feedback control based learning in games: The introduction of feedback control<br/>methods in learning in games is very recent, and there are many important unresolved issues. Proposed<br/>topics of interest include strategic advantage of feedback control based methods, analysis of systems with<br/>heterogeneous learning algorithms, dynamic network interconnections, and supervised switching for learning.<br/>Continuum action spaces: The learning in games framework currently applies to learning among a finite<br/>set of choices. This direction involves learning with decisions over a continuum, such as dynamic resource<br/>allocation problems. Issues include new feedback control based approaches to distributed optimization,<br/>severely limited information structures, and complementary sharing of information structures.<br/>Multiagent games with state evolution: The learning in games framework uses a static game setup.<br/>The state variable is the state of learning, but not inherent states of subsystems or the environment. This<br/>direction considers learning for games with internal states, also known as Markov or stochastic games. Issues<br/>include changes of time-scale for expert selection, feedback control based Q-learning, and integrator action.<br/>Application to Evolvable Hardware: Evolvable hardware is an emerging area that uses notions inspired<br/>by biological evolution for the design of reconfigurable, self-organizing hardware. The proposed concepts on<br/>multiagent may be viewed as an engineered evolution with its blending of feedback control and multiagent<br/>learning. This project will use the evolvable hardware paradigm to illustrate and motivate the proposed<br/>research.<br/>Intellectual Merit: There is an extensive body of research in the area of multiple player games. In the case<br/>of non-zero-sum games, the concept of mixed strategy (i.e, randomized) Nash equilibrium, despite its central<br/>role, has received considerable scrutiny as to how players, through repeated interactions, would ever converge<br/>to a Nash equilibrium. Indeed there are long standing examples to the contrary. The innovative basis of<br/>the proposed research establishes that simple notions from feedback control can enable such convergence.<br/>Consequentially, this research opens many new possibilities into how to design distributed adaptive systems<br/>from a game theoretic viewpoint.<br/>Broader Impact: The proposed research will have a broader impact on societal applications and undergraduate<br/>student eduction.<br/>Societal: The distributed systems concept is relevant in a multitude of domains, both engineered and<br/>social. These include data networks, distributed robotics, traffic networks, distributed design, power grid<br/>infrastructure, and distributed computation, as well as economic exchange, social exchange, and political<br/>coalition dynamics. The proposed work addresses a fundamental component of the mathematical models of<br/>such systems and has potential implications in a variety of areas.<br/>Educational: Key activities to be undertaken are 1) Introducing 1-unit freshman courses on the concept<br/>of distributed systems and feedback control and their applications. This is through UCLA's Fiat Lux<br/>freshman seminar series, and 2) Developing an research test-bed based on evolvable hardware as a venue to<br/>incorporate undergraduate research-level participation through directed study electives. Of course, these activities<br/>are in addition to the usual education and training of graduate student researchers and dissemination<br/>of results to the research community.

For example, I got an 'A' Shut up! You got an A? As to how it is interpreted, human activity is generally context sensitive. For instance, is the new fence at a country's boarder useful to sustain good neighbors or is it a provocation? Although no one would deny the importance of context, the question of when it does its work remains open. Does context pre-prepare cognition for action, or does it play its role after the fact? If cognitive activity self-organizes to best anticipate idiosyncratic situations, for example, then context would have a primary, preparative function, and could be considered to be part of cognitive activity. The main problem with this hypothesis is that conventional methods of behavioral science are not designed to study idiosyncratic context effects. <br/><br/>Drs. Van Orden and Holden will approach the problem of context from the perspective of self -organization in the coordination of brain and body with the environment. This approach has proven to be a useful and reliable characterization of motor coordination, but self-organization is relatively less established as a hypothesis about cognition. As such, these intuitive hypotheses need to be fully fleshed out. With support from the National Science Foundation, Drs. Van Orden and Holden will develop and test methods to study whether context is constitutive of cognitive activity. This will require an expanded range of data that examine self-regulating phenomenon of self-organization, as well as new methods to better explore and reveal cognitive dynamics as self-organizing phenomena. Previously, the tools developed to study complex, fractal, nonlinear, dynamical systems had been described primarily in the research literatures in which they were employed. The project will include efforts to make new tools available to behavioral and cognitive scientists. For instance, Drs. Van Orden and Holden are two of four instructors who teach nonlinear methods in the context of an American Psychological Association Advanced Training Institute. The project includes collaboration between the University of Cincinnati and California State University, a DOE-certified Hispanic-serving institution that emphasizes undergraduate education. The project entails training and mentoring opportunities for groups not historically represented in the sciences. It is also one of the first projects in support of research at an interdisciplinary center for Cognition, Action & Perception at the University of Cincinnati.

Matthew J. M. Krane and David R. Johnson<br/>School of Materials Engineering<br/>Purdue University<br/><br/>Abstract: This research program will consist of modeling and experiments that will examine ways to control the mass and heat transfer during the casting of high temperature alloys for rotating parts in gas turbine engines. The research will address the approaches to investment cast titanium aluminide (TiAl) alloys with aligned TiAl/Ti3Al lamellar microstructures, which exhibit significant improvements in creep resistances over the same alloys conventionally cast. Currently, there is no casting process for TiAl that can produce these aligned lamellar microstructures at reasonable growth rates, so successful completion of this work should arouse interest among the gas turbine manufacturers. <br/><br/>Intellectual merit: To develop the needed processing science, several concepts will be evaluated. A seed crystal of fixed and limited composition will be used to orient the high temperature hcp -phase so that an aligned lamellar TiAl/Ti3Al microstructure results during subsequent heat treatment. However, the compositional window for the bulk alloy is limited. By using a preform between the seed and bulk alloy, mixing of the seed and the alloy compositions can be minimized; thus, enlarging the window of compositions for successful crystal growth. The design of performs must allow liquid metal to infiltrate, but have small enough pores to restrict diffusion of mass during solidification, suppressing the nucleation of undesirable phases from the melt. The physical mechanisms underlying the growth through the preform and the effect of varying cross-section and heat extraction direction on the development of the single crystal microstructure will be modeled using a cellular automaton-finite volume (CA-FV) approach. Experiments will focus on understanding the role that the ceramic insert has on increasing the compositional window for single crystal growth of multicomponent TiAl alloys. Results from the CA simulations will be used in the initial preform design. While the behavior of the solidifying metal in the preform and as it exits is governed by local heat and mass transfer, once out into the mold cavity, the stability of the microstructure may also be affected by thermosolutal convection, which may sufficiently disrupt the transport of solute near the dendrite tips. The structure of these flows and their and effect on the microstructure will also be investigated through numerical modeling. <br/><br/>Broader impacts: The work described here has the potential to enable a significant advance in the mechanical properties of parts used for lightweight structural applications at higher engine operating temperatures. The modeling effort expand the ability to predict the behavior of microstructural evolution of multicomponent/multiphase alloys in real processes. This research will expose both graduate and undergraduate students to cutting edge materials technology in an industry important to this country's military and economy. International collaborations include experimental work performed by the Purdue team at Kyoto University (Japan) and the Interdisciplinary Research Centre in High Temperature Materials at the University of Birmingham (UK).

These two families of oxides will be non-centrosymmetric (NCS) and polar, allowing for piezoelectric and ferroelectric behavior. In addition to structural characterization, powder and single crystal X-ray diffraction and neutron diffraction, the materials will be characterized by converse piezoelectric and ferroelectric hysteresis (polarization vs. electric field) measurements. All of the measurements will allow us to determine the structural origin of the physical response. The knowledge gained from this research will aid in developing structure property relationships, and ultimately enable the 'rational' design of new classes of materials.<br/><br/>%%%<br/><br/>Fundamental to advances in technology is the creation, i.e. synthesis, of new classes of materials. Ideally, these new materials should be tailored with specific technological properties. A synthetic strategy has been developed that aims to create new materials with specific properties piezoelectricity and ferroelectricity. Both piezoelectrics and ferroelectrics are used in a host of applications, such as non-volatile random access memories, capacitors, sensors, and actuators. Research, however, into fundamentally new piezoelectric and ferroelectric materials is challenging. This is attributable to the strict symmetry requirements of the materials in question a non-centrosymmetric (NCS) crystal structure must be achieved. Current synthetic strategies can now increase the incidence of NCS, in any new material, to nearly 40% - far greater than the 15% observed in nature. These synthetic strategies are leading to new materials with predictable properties, and are therefore enabling the development of a 'rational' materials design paradigm.

The research team consists of five mathematical scientists, representing complementary expertise in pure and applied harmonic analysis, computational mathematics, and statistics, and two experts in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). The project highlights scientific challenges in the domain of MR data acquisition and reconstruction, including image formation from sparse and/or non-uniformly collected data, restoration of data corrupted by system imperfections, as well as rapid and robust image construction from data acquired by multiple receivers. The crosscutting expertise of the research team is enabling development of rigorous tools for addressing these challenges, providing the underpinnings for provable results, quantifiable measures of performance, and efficient algorithms. The team's approach entails in-depth mathematical study of data collection procedures utilized in MRI, including the physical constraints under which they must be undertaken. This understanding provides the basis for conceptualization, analysis, implementation, and validation of accurate, efficient and effective practical algorithms for processing imaging data. A particular emphasis of the project is unification of the data collection and image generation aspects of MRI, which are often considered independently even by informed researchers. Methodology is sought to enable joint design of acquisition and post-processing techniques that can optimally serve medical requirements. In particular, this research aims to facilitate design of data post-processing methods that are fully informed about the characteristics of the raw sensor data, such as its non-uniformly sampled spectral nature and underlying statistical variations.<br/><br/>The activities of the collaborative research team from Arizona State University and the Barrow Neurological Institute (BNI) are expected to have significant impact on strengthening the mathematical foundations of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The project focuses several areas of applicable mathematics on a circle of application problems where the introduction of improved mathematical techniques offers potential for substantial performance improvements. These, in turn, will ultimately have broad social impact by improving the fidelity of medical diagnoses, decreasing the cost of medical tools that are presently very expensive, and alleviating patient discomfort by decreasing imaging time and the need for patients to remain motionless for extended periods for accurate imaging. Broader impact will be realized through the connections of the planned research to other application areas, such as synthetic aperture radar, where algorithmic challenges in acquisition and post-processing are similar to those in MRI. Aligned with the research program is a plan for integration of educational components which includes support of undergraduate and graduate students, as well as the design of new courses. Junior participants will be provided with the modern mathematical training which is needed for their later pursuit of cross-disciplinary cutting-edge professional careers.

New geodetic, geomorphologic, paleoseismic, gravity, and seismic measurements are being combined to: (1) measure Caribbean plate motion near Jamaica to establish the full fault slip budget across the island and Gonave microplate motion relative to the Caribbean and North American plates; (2) establish the locations, slip senses, and long-term slip rates along major active Jamaican faults through a combination of geomorphologic, paleoseismologic, and targeted gravity studies; (3) construct and test forward and inverse models of fault slip rates, to distinguish between proposed models for how slip is transferred between the offset fault strands, and to improve earthquake hazard assessment in this densely populated and earthquake-prone country use constraints from all measurements; (4) combine results with GPS site velocities from Hispaniola to derive a model for Gonave microplate motion that is fully consistent with all the data.<br/><br/>This project should provide a better understanding of earthquake hazard in Jamaica, which has experienced two destructive earthquakes since 1600 and continues to be vulnerable to significant earthquake damage due to seismic energy focusing and liquefaction of unconsolidated alluvium in much of the heavily populated and economically important southern half of the country. The measurements should provide useful information about the earthquake cycle over range of spatial and temporal scales, including the millenial-scale seismic history and potential of the Plantain Garden fault near the capital city of Kingston to the year-to-year budget of interseismic elastic strain that is accumulating in all areas of the island. The research will be done in collaboration with the Jamaican Seismological Network, which is responsible for seismological network operation, seismic research, and earthquake hazard assessment and response.

To do this the brain extracts signals (such as motion, color, and binocular disparities) from the retinal images and then uses these signals as ''cues'' to construct visual percepts that accurately represent the local environment. For example, binocular disparities are signals that are used by the brain as a cue for depth, which can be demonstrated by looking at a stereogram. A question of long standing interest is how the brain knows which cues to use during the construction of a given percept. In other words, how does the brain learn to use cues appropriately during perception?<br/><br/>With support of the National Science Foundation, Dr. Backus and his colleagues are conducting experiments to clarify an important aspect of this problem, namely, how the brain decides to start utilizing a new cue during perception. Recent work in the Backus lab confirmed that under certain conditions the brain''s visual system can be trained to use new cues. This training was achieved by means of classical (Pavlovian) conditioning procedures in which a new signal (such as a motion direction) was paired with depth cues that were already trusted by the brain (such as binocular disparity). The experiments will use simulated 3D stimuli to measure the rate at which new cues are learned under a variety of conditions. In addition to advancing our basic understanding of perceptual learning, this work may lead to the development of new techniques for training human perception and to better computer vision systems that can improve themselves through learning.
0649866	IDBR: Development of High-Speed Two-Photon Excitation Fluorescence Microscopy with Chromatically Extended Depth of Focus	DBI	INSTRUMENTAT & INSTRUMENT DEVP	09/01/2007	06/15/2009	Zhiwen Liu	PA	Pennsylvania State Univ University Park	Continuing grant	Cort L. Anderson	08/31/2011	$435,679.00	Shizhuo Yin	zzl1@psu.edu	110 Technology Center Building	UNIVERSITY PARK	PA	168027000	8148651372	BIO	1108	1108, 9184, BIOT	$0.00	This award is for the development of a faster two-photon fluorescence microscope, with improvements especially in the axial scanning speed. Speed will be increased by wavelength division multiplexing (or chromatic two-photon imaging). Although much progress has been made in improving the lateral scanning speed, a high-speed axial scanning method is still missing. Slow mechanical translation of the objective lens or the specimen itself is still required in order to scan in the axial direction, which limits the 3D imaging speed. As a result, existing instruments have very limited capability to monitor fast biological processes (e.g., transient calcium signals) in 3D and in the x-z or y-z cross-section. The proposed instrument will have a significant impact on 3D microscopy, one of the most important and widely used tools in biology. It will allow researchers to study fast dynamics (e.g., membrane trafficking, chemical waves within or between cells) and provide fundamental understanding of various inter- and intra- cellular processes such as calcium imaging. <br/><br/>In addition to its scientific benefits, the project will involve undergraduate researchers as well as graduate students. Woman and minority students will be particularly encouraged to be involved in the program. The investigators will work closely with Penn State organizations such as Women in Engineering to develop outreach education programs for under-represented groups as well as K-12 students.

The GC-MS will be dedicated to analyses of molecular constituents in geological samples that can provide invaluable clues to the diverse origins and varied fates of sedimentary organic matter. It will replace aged, high-maintenance GC-MS instrumentation that is at the end of its useful lifespan. Graduate and undergraduate students, and also visiting scientists, will be trained in its operation, learning how to identify organic compounds amid complex mixtures, and will use the results from their analyses in a broad spectrum of projects. Data obtained using this GC-MS instrument, coupled with information on isotopic compositions, will enhance research focused on understanding the numerous controls on molecular and isotopic compositions of earth materials. The results from such biogeochemical research will benefit understanding of the history of global climate and environmental change, the biogeochemical carbon cycle, microbial activity and the deep biosphere, and evolutionary processes.

The instruments include a new patrol Fabry-Perot interferometer (FPI), an all-sky Doppler imager (ASDI), and a spectrometer. The observations will be used to systematically address a number of issues in mesospheric and thermospheric physics. Research will include the study of mid-latitude mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) tides using the combined FPI mesospheric and thermospheric Doppler winds and all-sky images from hydroxyl and oxygen emissions and incoherent scatter radar observations. The semidiurnal tide usually has a large vertical wavelength so the combined observations will provide a large vertical altitude coverage during both the day and night, and will allow for a better characterization of the vertical tidal structure. Also, the all-sky imager at Millstone Hill will record the hydroxyl, sodium, and oxygen nightglow emissions for gravity wave activity and the investigators will use the FPI neutral winds from the same emissions to calculate the intrinsic gravity wave parameters. From the intrinsic parameters, they will deduce the propagation modes of the waves and several important wave parameters including quantitative measurements of vertical scale-sizes, estimates of the vertical fluxes of horizontal wave momentum and energy, and the amount of wave flux divergence between the airglow layers, the hydroxyl and oxygen layers, in particular. The FPI neutral wind and temperature measurements will be used to study the long-term trends in the mesosphere and thermosphere in connection with the solar cycles, and small-scale thermosphere temperature and neutral wind variations will be studied using the all sky Doppler imager. The regional cluster of optical instruments in conjunction with the Millstone Hill Incoherent Scatter radar will provide comprehensive coverage from the mesosphere to the thermosphere. They will provide a unique data set for studies of MLT dynamics and ionosphere/thermosphere interaction in the sub-auroral region. Multi-institute participation will foster more collaboration between different research groups. The Millstone Hill optical instruments will also be the test bed for the future distributed instrument projects.

Deep and broadly scoured alpine valleys are one of the most spectacular legacies of Quaternary glaciation. However, very little specific information is available about the total magnitudes and the temporal and spatial patterns of erosion and relief development in these valleys. Yet erosion and relief development of these valleys is central to the evolution of the coupled system of erosion, climate, and tectonics that shapes major mountain ranges. Acquiring quantitative information about such valley development over timescales of a few million years and exhumation thicknesses of less than 2 km will be a major contribution toward resolving the question of whether the late Cenozoic transition to glacial climate was accompanied by increased valley incision rates and increased relief generation. <br/><br/>This research will be the first systematic application of a very promising new geochemical tool, apatite 4He/3He thermochronometry. This technique is fundamentally different from conventional thermochronometric methods in its sensitivity to uniquely low temperatures and its ability to derive cooling histories from single mineral grains. Results will be examined for connections to the history of global climate change and for characteristic patterns of variation along the longitudinal axes of valley networks. <br/><br/>The research will establish the usefulness of a new geochemical technique that has the potential for widespread applications in surface process studies and tectonics. The project will constitute an important part of the research program for a junior PI, and will be one of the first scientific applications of his new noble gas thermochronometry laboratory facility. The proposed work will constitute an important part of a graduate student's doctoral research and training, and will be used as a case study in undergraduate classes.

The long-term goal is to achieve a new approach for regenerating natural bone tissues, thereby overcoming limitations of current bone grafts. A strength of this research is the incorporation of activated macrophages into the microparticles to act as a source of bioactive factors for osteoblast differentiation and bone regeneration. This approach would allow the cell-based delivery of multiple factors, and potentially avoid complicated pharmaceutical formulations. It also has the potential for injection of the microparticles that has key advantages over large prefabricated biomaterial scaffolds. Multiple exciting training, mentoring, and outreach activities are planned.

The proposal addresses integration and application of multi-phase/multi-microphone directional hearing aids with on-chip MEMS microphones. This will reduce the microphone size and spacing, use new signal processing methods for phase/directionality for the digital hearing aid, extend battery-life, and will reduce size. Another major benefit will be improved noise suppression and directionality by utilizing nano-scale devices and adaptive mixed-signal microelectronics. This proposal is aimed at developing new university-industry collaborative research on ultra-low power multi-phase digital hearing aid systems on a chip. The proposal targets high-risk/high-gain research focused at the fundamental issues facing micro/nano ICs, MEMS, and signal processing for multi-phase array digital hearing aids. The long term road map for this project has the strong potential to impact many research areas that are not being carried out by industry. The synergetic nature of this research will enable new developments for an innovative collaborative industry-university educational program as well as the direct transfer of fundamentally new science and technology between university and industry. From the technology perspective, this project will lead to new ultra-low power micro-level audio transceivers on a chip for the digital hearing aid with aggressive goals to reduce the size and power.
0649897	Instrumental Development of Microfluidics-based Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting Device for Research and Education	DBI	INSTRUMENTAT & INSTRUMENT DEVP	09/01/2007	11/14/2008	Nily Dan	PA	Drexel University	Standard Grant	Cort L. Anderson	08/31/2010	$85,075.00		dan@coe.drexel.edu	1505 Race St, 8th Floor	Philadelphia	PA	191021119	2158955849	BIO	1108	1108, 9184, BIOT	$0.00	This award is for the development of a microfluidic-based fluorescent-activated cell sorting device (M-FACS). The M-FACS will combine the single droplet control of microfluidics with the cell screening and sorting of a FACS. If successful, the M-FACS will allow one to encapsulate individual cells, add additional compounds to each cell, incubate these and then sort the results, all at 1000-10,000 cells per second, allowing good statistics to be obtained on a distribution of a population of cells. M-FACS will enable the study of chemicals excreted by cells or presented on their surface. It will likewise enable using individual cells in an assay that screens a large library. This would significantly increase the utility of FACS. One way to encapsulate individual cells within drops is through the use of microfluidic techniques. Individual cells can be suspended in drops in an inert carrier fluid. Moreover, it is also feasible to completely control these drops: they can be combined with other drops, they can be divided into smaller drops, they can be interrogated with optical probes, and they can be sorted with electric fields. This new technology will be supported with essential theoretical work to fully understand the new possibilities that we will be able to accomplish. The M-FACS overcomes one significant limitation of FACS: with FACS, the cells must be sorted as soon as they are encapsulated. The M-FACS will qualitatively change the applicability of FACS. It will allow using single cells as part of an assay, testing them against a library of compounds and sorting the cells based on the results. It will allow the study of chemicals excreted from single cells, or cell-cell interactions between cells. It will allow cell growth to be a criterion of the sorting. This will allow myriad new problems to be investigated. <br/><br/>A desk-top Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting machine with greatly extended capabilities will be of great benefit to the broader scientific community. The machine will be developed by students and post docs, both experimental and theoretical. They will receive training in a field that merges engineering with biology to create novel devices that enable new science. The work will also be disseminated at a workshop that will describe the completed device.
0641943	Neural Bases of Nucleus Accumbens-Mediated Feeding	IOS	ANIMAL BEHAVIOR, MODULATION	08/15/2007	08/01/2007	Thomas Stratford	IL	University of Illinois at Chicago	Standard Grant	Marise Parent	07/31/2011	$515,411.00		ratdoc@uic.edu	809 S MARSHFIELD	Chicago	IL	606124305	3129962862	BIO	7659, 7714	1096, 7659, 9179, 9183, BIOT	$0.00	Powerful effects on feeding are produced by manipulations of a number of neurotransmitter systems within the brain region known as the nucleus accumbens shell (AcbSh), suggesting that this part of the brain may play an important role in the control of food intake. The long-term goal of this research project is to identify and characterize the neural circuits through which the AcbSh produces changes in feeding behavior and to determine under what conditions the system controls food intake. The AcbSh appears to control activity in some neurons in another brain region known to mediate food intake, the lateral hypothalamus (LH). However, it is not yet known whether these two brain regions work together to control feeding behavior. The current proposal involves the use of a number of complementary neuroanatomical, behavioral, pharmacological, and molecular techniques to determine 1) whether neurons in the LH are necessary for the expression of AcbSh-mediated changes in feeding behavior and changes in activity in other brain regions, 2) whether LH neurons activated by AcbSh manipulations are connected to the medial hypothalamus or hindbrain and whether the brain peptide orexin, synthesized in some activated LH neurons, is necessary for the expression of AcbSh-mediated feeding, 3) whether AcbSh lesions disrupt spontaneous feeding and deprivation-induced food intake and brain activation in the circuit. The multidisciplinary nature of these studies will provide a rich and varied training experience for undergraduate and graduate students working on the project and successful completion of these studies will greatly clarify both the functional relationship between the AcbSh and lateral hypothalamus and the role of this circuit in the control of normal feeding behavior. In a more general sense, the project will provide data critical to advancing our understanding of the functional organization of the brain that will serve to guide neuroscientists in the investigation of other neural systems involved in the control of motivated behaviors.

The movement and control of the cannulas is based on the storage and release of elastic energy via translational and rotational motions induced by the user either locally or remotely via tele-operation systems. The research will provide better understanding and characterization of how actuation can be encoded in flexible structures and how it can be controlled. It mimics various natural creatures such as snakes, octopus tentacles, elephant trunks, etc., hence it can be considered as a biologically-inspired device. Issues such as miniaturization, complex tissue-device interfacing, and tele-operation add onto the scientific challenges of the project. This activity integrates research activities with educational opportunities for undergraduate and high school students in a coherent fashion. At the same time, it seeks to develop an improved technology for minimally invasive surgery which could benefit many people through improved quality of health care.

The aim of the workshop is to examine recent advances in the theoretical understanding of neural coding. Recent contributions from dynamical systems, statistical physics and other multidisciplinary views are fast changing this field and the workshop will provide an opportunity for international experts to discuss the state of art of the field, present challenges and establish a research program that will advance the field.<br/><br/>Participants of the workshop will include US experts and young researchers who will interact with their Latin American counterparts. Researchers are required to stay beyond the workshop, and will visit local research groups; this will both help young researchers gain international experience and inject enthusiasm into local research activity. The gathering should foster bridges between Latin America and US research centers and lead to longer term relationships among researchers.

The ultimate objective is to develop and commercialize ionic liquids whose properties are tuned for a number of potential processes involving hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), including absorption cooling, gas separation and green processes for recycling HFCs. To achieve this objective, the investigators develop and apply computational methods to predict how physical properties and phase behavior of ionic liquid / HFC mixtures depend upon structure, chemical composition, and thermodynamic state point. Using this information in conjunction with experimental characterization studies, DuPont will synthesize and evaluate new ionic liquids whose properties are optimized for the specific commercial applications under investigation. This NSf project supports of all the computational parts of the project, including development of transferable force fields for ionic liquids and HFCs, development of efficient simulation methods for carrying out solubility calculations, and the calculation of absorption isotherms and other physical properties important for commercial application. DuPont will conduct all the experiments in support of the project and will share data with the modeling group at Notre Dame. <br/><br/>Intellectual merit <br/>Ionic liquids are a relatively new material class with unique properties including non-volatility and excellent solvation capabilities. Interest in commercial use of ionic liquids in the chemical industry has skyrocketed, but commercialization is hampered by a lack of physical property data and our inability to understand and predict how properties can be changed through chemical and structural modification of the ionic liquid. The PIs seek to overcome these limitations via a combined molecular modeling and experimental study. They focus on the physical properties and phase behavior of ionic liquid / HFC mixtures, both because of the overall importance of HFCs to DuPont and the fact that two different DuPont business units have identified several potential commercial applications involving these mixtures. However, the results and simulation methods will be widely applicable to other gas / ionic liquid systems as well. The project provides an ideal mechanism to link fundamental modeling work from academia with experimental and commercial development activities of industry. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts <br/>In addition to the obvious environmental and energy efficiency benefits that would result from a successful project, the research from this project will result in the development and dissemination of new force fields for ionic liquids and HFCs, as well as a new simulation method for computing gas and vapor solubilities in liquids. The method will be made accessible to the broader user community through incorporation in open source software. The graduate student assigned to the project will be trained in modeling and statistical mechanics, but will also hold internship positions at DuPont. During these internships, the student will carry out experimental studies in support of the project and learn first hand about industrial research. The investigators will continue our efforts at recruiting undergraduate and high school students to work on the project, paying special attention to attracting under-represented groups.

Gravitational wave observations have the potential to shed light on a variety of phenomena such as gamma ray bursters and black hole collisions. To exploit fully this rich information requires theoretical modeling of possible sources. These models will be crucial for confronting experimental data with predictions for the extraction of the physical information. It is within the context of both modeling relevant phenomena and making contact with the data analysis effort that the research supported by this award seeks to numerically model binary systems able to produce the most likely detectable signals. Such modeling will incorporate novel techniques to obtain a robust and accurate description of the system and to efficiently exploit present and future available computational resources. A number of issues at the interface between model and analysis which constrain the sharpness of the required models as well as understanding how to optimize the usefulness of the gradually available information provided by the models will be addressed. This research will yield advanced numerical techniques for an important scientific problem, and aid in the growing field at the interface between simulations of gravitational wave sources and analysis of gravitational wave data. Young researchers will be trained in this area of research.

Given that this process involves breaking the chemical bonds in the solid lattice, a quantum-mechanical description is necessary. However, a fully atomistic description of the problem is not viable. The PI proposes to develop analysis-based numerical methodologies that couple an atomistic description near the location of the defect with a coarse-grained description far from it. Quantum-mechanical effects are studied in the context of Density-Functional Theory. This approach can effectively remove the limitation in the size of the system considered, and could gear the development of nanometer-sized devices in new directions.<br/><br/>This proposal also includes the development of special courses in multiscale modeling, and an undergraduate research component in a vertical environment that involves undergraduate students, graduate students, and post-doctoral fellows. In addition, the proposal includes outreach to local high schools. By exposing students to mathematics at such an early stage, the investigator hopes to awaken in them the desire to pursue a career in mathematics.

Similar to the 2005 meeting, it is expected that the number of speakers and participants to number approximately 130-150 from the US and abroad, at all career levels, and represent institutions from academia, industry, private institutes, and federal laboratories. Concerted efforts to recruit women, persons with disabilities, and scientists from underrepresented groups as speakers and participants have been expanded. For instance, in addition to the 2007 GRC, a Graduate Research Seminar (GRS) in Plant Metabolic Engineering immediately before the GRC is developed, which may serve as a template for future meetings. The GRS provides a unique venue for junior scientists (Ph.D. students and postdoctoral fellows) to present their research in a more relaxed setting in front of their peers and is designed to reach out to under-represented groups of students and pre-professionals. The Gordon Conferences continue to be considered among the top scientific meetings worldwide, attracting top researchers in settings that are conducive to developing interactions and exploring new horizons. Participants to the GRS will be encouraged and expected to stay for the GRC, further enhancing the educational component of this conference. It is expected that the GRS will have a significant impact in attracting top junior scientists to the plant metabolic engineering field.
0645343	CAREER: Land Use, Geologic and Climatic Controls on Stream Processes in Northern New England Using Airborne Laser Swath Mapping	EAR	EDUCATION AND HUMAN RESOURCES, GEOMORPHOLOGY & LAND USE DYNAM	08/01/2007	08/15/2010	Noah Snyder	MA	Boston College	Continuing grant	Paul Cutler	07/31/2013	$438,806.00		noah.snyder@bc.edu	140 Commonwealth Avenue	Chestnut Hill	MA	024673800	6175528000	GEO	1575, 7458	0000, 1045, 1187, 4444, 7458, OTHR	$0.00	This project integrates analysis of remote-sensing data, field surveys and mapping, and fluvial models to test hypotheses of the fundamental controls on stream form and process in the deglaciated landscape of northern New England. Rivers in regions covered by late Pleistocene continental glaciers evolve through a combination of bedrock erosion, availability and transport of bedload, and ecological succession. Stream morphology, and therefore habitat suitability, varies in the downstream direction, depending on local sedimentary sources and sinks. Historical land-use change from deforestation to riparian protection further influences fluvial processes. At present, motivated by the near extirpation of Atlantic salmon in Maine, non-profit groups and government agencies are working to reverse fluvial habitat degradation by stabilizing watershed sediment inputs and removing dams. However, these restoration efforts are typically guided by geomorphic studies of salmon rivers in other regions. This proposal seeks to understand the trajectory of landscape response to changes in land use, and develop and test spatial numerical models that relate stream physical processes to habitat quality.<br/><br/>Airborne laser swath mapping (ALSM) will expand the advances made in quantitative geomorphology using digital elevation models (DEMs) over the past 15 years. ALSM surveys yield high-resolution measurements of bare-earth topography, thickness of forest cover, and water depth over entire watersheds. This study will collect ALSM data from three watersheds in Maine and use channel morphologic measurements as input for numerical models of transport processes. These spatial models will be tested through comparison to field surveys, geological and ecological mapping, fish-population datasets, and past conditions using historical aerial photographs.<br/><br/>Teams of undergraduate and Master's students will conduct the research, working together on each of the watersheds using field, geospatial, and numerical methods. Each student will have a role within the team that evolves to eventual production and presentation of research projects. Multi-year student involvement will ensure strong professor-student, graduate-undergraduate, and undergraduate-undergraduate mentoring. The proposed research is directly relevant to ongoing ecosystem restoration projects in northern New England. All phases of this study will include direct outreach by students and the PI to share results and methods with land managers, watershed restoration non-profit groups, high school students, and other scientists from a variety of fields in forums from field workshops to national meetings. These efforts will include specific recommendations, based on research findings, for optimizing future restoration projects. Through interactions with community-based groups, students will gain an appreciation for the challenges of land-management decision-making processes. This exchange between students and stakeholders will ensure that the research has a strong societal and scientific impact.
0642830	Collaborative Research: The Pleistocene Erosion History of Glaciated Alpine Valleys Interrogated by Apatite 4He/3He Thermochronometry	EAR	GEOMORPHOLOGY & LAND USE DYNAM	08/01/2007	08/10/2007	Kurt Cuffey	CA	University of California-Berkeley	Standard Grant	Paul Cutler	07/31/2010	$46,465.00		kcuffey@berkeley.edu	Sponsored Projects Office	BERKELEY	CA	947045940	5106428109	GEO	7458	0000, OTHR	$0.00	This research will reconstruct detailed histories of erosion and relief generation at locations within two great coastal mid-latitude mountain ranges, the Coast Mountains of British Columbia and the Southern Alps (Fiordlands region) of New Zealand. Deep and broadly scoured alpine valleys are one of the most spectacular legacies of Quaternary glaciation. However, very little specific information is available about the total magnitudes and the temporal and spatial patterns of erosion and relief development in these valleys. Yet erosion and relief development of these valleys is central to the evolution of the coupled system of erosion, climate, and tectonics that shapes major mountain ranges. Acquiring quantitative information about such valley development over timescales of a few million years and exhumation thicknesses of less than 2 km will be a major contribution toward resolving the question of whether the late Cenozoic transition to glacial climate was accompanied by increased valley incision rates and increased relief generation. <br/><br/>This research will be the first systematic application of a very promising new geochemical tool, apatite 4He/3He thermochronometry. This technique is fundamentally different from conventional thermochronometric methods in its sensitivity to uniquely low temperatures and its ability to derive cooling histories from single mineral grains. Results will be examined for connections to the history of global climate change and for characteristic patterns of variation along the longitudinal axes of valley networks. <br/><br/>The research will establish the usefulness of a new geochemical technique that has the potential for widespread applications in surface process studies and tectonics. The project will constitute an important part of the research program for a junior PI, and will be one of the first scientific applications of his new noble gas thermochronometry laboratory facility. The proposed work will constitute an important part of a graduate student's doctoral research and training, and will be used as a case study in undergraduate classes.

A particular focus is on reaching students who are on the edge of dropping out of STEM careers due either to insufficient background or being a late bloomer, only recently discovering an affinity for the sciences. To support these efforts the project team has established strong ties between faculty at USC and the students, counselors, and faculty from the state technical colleges, the USC branch campuses, and regional secondary schools. The recruitment plan includes i) outreach to high school career and guidance counselors, ii) continuing education credit in STEM counseling granted for successful completion of an associated professional development curriculum, and iii) the use of broad-based interdisciplinary seminar courses, along with history and philosophy of science and technology courses to attract non-STEM students to STEM disciplines. The retention plan features i) new bridge courses to prepare students for the rigors of STEM disciplines (especially calculus), ii) development of a Summer Institute to improve the math readiness of students and to coordinate STEM research experiences, and iii) broad-based student support activities for all STEM majors and activities that target majors with the lowest retention rates. The intellectual merit of the project rests in the strong and diverse team of faculty and administrators committed to the project and their wide-ranging interests and experiences, which are focused particularly on the at risk students described above. The broader impacts of the project are being felt through the comprehensive involvement of leading institutions at all levels in the state's higher education system. Such involvement affects in turn a large number of in-state students with resulting benefits to increasing the state's STEM workforce.
0650405	Sulfonium Ylides to Quaternary Substituted Indolines	CHE	METHODOLOGY	08/15/2007	05/05/2009	Jon Rainier	UT	University of Utah	Continuing grant	Tingyu Li	07/31/2010	$408,000.00		rainier@chem.utah.edu	75 S 2000 E	SALT LAKE CITY	UT	841128930	8015816903	MPS	1950	MANU, 9146	$0.00	This project addresses the development of diastereo- and enantioselective approaches to indolines having quaternary substitution at C(3). The chemical transformation enabling the efficient generation of these species involves the coupling of 2-thioindoles with vinyl carbenoids generated through the reaction of Rh(II) complexes with vinyl diazoacetates. These studies will lead to both a better understanding of the scope of this reaction and a better fundamental understanding of the chemistry of sulfonium ylides as well as adding to our understanding of the reactivity of indoles. Although this application is not focused on specific target molecules, the products from the sulfonium ylide chemistry will be subjected to a variety of chemical transformations, leading to the synthesis of a diverse array of architectures, some of which are present in bioactive targets.<br/><br/>With the support of the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program, Professor Jon D. Rainier, of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Utah, is studying unique metal-mediated reactions that rapidly and efficiently afford complex structures relevant to the synthesis of biologically active compounds. Through these studies, Professor Rainier and his students are developing both an in-depth fundamental understanding of the structure and reactivity of unusual and reactive organic species and a set of new tools aiding in the synthesis of organic molecules. A fundamental understanding of chemical synthesis through chemical reactions and reactivity will have a broad impact on a number of important areas. The most obvious of these are those that are associated with the development of new medicines and materials. Somewhat less obvious are the biological and environmental sciences where chemical reactivity plays a central role. In addition, this chemical synthesis program will be beneficial to society by training scientists who will play important roles during their independent careers in areas such as the chemical, biotech, and pharmaceutical industries, and/or in academia.
0648848	Intimate Biology: Epistemic Strategies, Research Organisms, and the Career of American Protozoan Genetics	SES	Hist & Philosophy of SET	08/01/2007	07/15/2009	Judith Schloegel	IL	Schloegel Judith J	Continuing grant	Frederick M Kronz	07/31/2010	$94,357.00				Clarendon Hills	IL	605141004		SBE	1353	0000, OTHR	$0.00	Introduction<br/>The research project proposed will analyze the epistemic strategy of an organism-oriented approach to the use of model organisms in experimental biology by examining the history of protozoan genetics in the United States. It will focus on the careers of American biologists and geneticists, Herbert Spencer Jennings and his student, Tracy Sonneborn, and their research organisms, the ciliated unicellular protozoa, Paramecium and P. aurelia, respectively. The project will consider the use of protozoa as model organisms in relation to the epistemic strategy with which they generally were employed by Jennings and Sonneborn -- that of gaining intimate knowledge of the organisms. It will compare this strategy with the problem-oriented approach to the use of model organisms largely practiced by T. H. Morgan's Drosophila school and its many successor programs. The objectives of this research are: (1) to elucidate the underlying philosophical beliefs and sociopolitical priorities that supported Jennings' and Sonneborn's approach to biological research; (2) to compare the beliefs and priorities that facilitated an organism-oriented approach with those associated with the competing, problem-oriented strategy in twentieth century genetics research; and (3) to examine the function of an organism-centered epistemic strategy in the dynamics of experimental systems in the life sciences. The historical method employed likewise will prioritize actors to analytical categories such as disciplines, and thus will follow the careers of Jennings, Sonneborn, and Paramecium into the related domains of animal behavior, developmental biology, and evolutionary biology, as well as that of genetics.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit<br/>This study will enrich recent discussions in science studies on the function of model organisms in the life sciences by illuminating the diversity of epistemic strategies for the use of model organisms available to researchers. Furthermore, it will contribute to recent thinking on the dynamics of experimental systems in the life sciences by illustrating the diverse means by which these epistemic strategies facilitate the evolution of experimental systems. Most broadly, by offering a longitudinal study spanning the joint scientific careers of Jennings and Sonneborn, from 1890 to 1981 -- a uniquely long span of time for most studies of recent science -- it will highlight the long-term consequences of scientists' values and commitments for the development of later scientific research.<br/><br/>Broader Impact<br/>This study will illuminate that the nature of genetic knowledge emanating from biological laboratories and journals is not inevitable, but that methodological choices informed by social and political priorities and philosophical beliefs have and will affect many aspects of biological experimentation, including the use of particular research organisms. This message will be communicated to a broader audience through publication of articles in biological journals committed to disseminating research on biology and society. Full funding of this NSF Scholar's Award proposal will provide support for two calendar years full-time research and writing, including travel to five US archives containing materials vital to the success of this project. Support also provides for access to the University of Chicago Library for use of primary and secondary research materials, and travel to one conference to present research results. The primary products of the proposed research will be a book and two journal articles that will disseminate the PI's research to a broader audience, consisting primarily of life scientists and biology educators.

Mathematics majors and minors may also study real analysis or abstract algebra. Students often find the transition from taking calculus courses to taking more formal, proof-based mathematics courses particularly challenging, and often a stumbling block to further academic success. Sophomore and junior level courses such as differential equations, linear algebra, geometry, and courses introducing set theory and logic constitute a core collection of courses that have the potential to facilitate this transition. The main goals of this project are to make contributions to theory and methodology in terms of the continuum between informal and formal mathematical reasoning. In particular, the PIs will develop theoretical means for interpreting the transition to formal, proof-based mathematics courses. They do so by using four different perspectives on the nature of the individual and collective growth of knowledge. The methodological products will include strategies for data collection and data analysis that allow for insights into student learning within and between each of the four different theoretical perspectives. The mathematical context for this work will primarily be linear algebra, with insights drawn from our prior work in differential equations, geometry, and set theory.

Berger<br/><br/>SAMSI is a national institute that will deeply impact the future<br/>of the statistical and mathematical sciences and, through them,<br/>science in general, by catalyzing creation of the theory and<br/>methodology necessary to confront the central data- and<br/>model-driven scientific challenges of our time. SAMSI will focus<br/>on new syntheses of the statistical sciences, applied mathematics<br/>and disciplinary science. To illustrate the vision, consider an<br/>activity central to modern science and technology, and with which<br/>SAMSI will be heavily engaged: numerical modeling of complex<br/>physical processes. Developing numerical models and evaluating<br/>their fidelity to reality requires merging knowledge from<br/>multiple disciplines. Applied mathematics builds on disciplinary<br/>understanding to construct a fine-detail numerical representation<br/>of the deterministic aspects of a process; probability provides<br/>concepts and insight to characterize stochastic elements of the<br/>process; and statistics provides the mechanisms to relate these<br/>constructs to observational data on the real-world process. But,<br/>despite a multiplicity of context-specific advances, there is<br/>currently no general framework for combining these disciplines,<br/>much less a formal system for simultaneously applying them. The<br/>SAMSI efforts in this direction will focus on filling this gap,<br/>by bringing together statisticians, mathematicians and modelers<br/>from across the country (and beyond) to establish frameworks for<br/>model development and validation, at a high level that spans<br/>multiple application contexts.<br/><br/>To carry out this synthesis of the statistical sciences, applied<br/>mathematical sciences and disciplinary sciences, SAMSI engages<br/>established researchers - from academia, industry, national<br/>laboratories and government - as well as young researchers<br/>(postdoctoral fellows and graduate students) at the formative<br/>stages of their careers. Each research program lasts from 6<br/>months to one year, and involves a host of activities ranging<br/>from research by intensive interdisciplinary working groups to<br/>broad, energizing workshops. Outreach to undergraduate students,<br/>high-school teachers and faculty from teaching institutions<br/>extends SAMSI's impact on the essential development of the<br/>national human resource base for science. To enable activities of<br/>the breadth and depth necessary for the success of SAMSI, the<br/>institute is a partnership between the National Science<br/>Foundation and the consortium of Duke University, North Carolina<br/>State University, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill<br/>and the National Institute of Statistical Sciences. These<br/>partners provide a uniquely strong base for SAMSI's national<br/>scope. Scientific input to SAMSI comes, in part, from a National<br/>Advisory Council composed of eminent statistical and mathematical<br/>scientists. Most important, SAMSI will engage the entire<br/>nationwide statistical and mathematical sciences communities, by<br/>means of widely publicized opportunities to bring problems to<br/>SAMSI, or direct SAMSI's attention to them.<br/><br/>

A 2-G enterprises SRM system that utilizes a recently developed pulsed tube cryocooler will eliminate the need for liquid Helium to cool to superconducting temperatures. The instrument will support NSF funded research by faculty and their students in the College of Oceanic and Atmospheric Sciences (COAS) at Oregon State University (OSU). Research on Holocene and deeper time geomagnetic field behavior (e.g., reversals, excursions and paleointensity), magnetostratigraphy, tectonics and environmental paleomagnetism will be facilitated. The SRM will serve the broader geoscience community for magnetic measurements of sediments held at the Oregon State Marine Geology Repository and for study of cores recovered from the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program and the International Continental Drilling Program. The instrument will be the first of its kinds on the U.S. west coast and data collected will be made available through community databases (MagIC). The PIs serve as mentors for the OSU Honors independent study program, the Hatfield Marine Science Center REU program and the Native Americans in Marine and Space Science Program.

Protein interaction networks have emerged as a canonical way to represent functional associations between proteins in a cell. In such a network, proteins are nodes and edges connect proteins that physically interact, or more broadly participate in the same biological process. For the molecular biologist, protein interaction networks are an invaluable resource, as they can aid in functionally annotating hypothetical proteins that are connected to proteins of known functions, identifying new multiprotein complexes, and suggesting promising target proteins for experimentation. This project will computationally predict interaction networks that integrate all available functional genomics data sources, compare predicted networks across microbes to extract functional modules, and generate concrete experimental recommendations. It will develop novel methodology for inferring transcriptional cascades on a global level and aligning these cascades to find conserved regulons. In addition it will create tools for computer-guided experimental validation in Caulobacter crescentus, which will guide efforts in two experimental laboratories. The result will be an experimentally tested means of predicting protein interactions ? and hence biology ? directly from genome sequence. The team will develop a powerful and user-friendly web interface where protein interaction networks from all sequenced microbes will be browsed and compared across species. The resulting data will be downloadable in convenient formats, and the software will be available through the General Public Licence (GPL). The team will directly involve several undergraduate students in the research, through the CURIS undergraduate research program at the Computer Science department. Research will be conducted at the Clark Center, a new building that is part of the BioX initiative at Stanford University. The BioX initiative's goal is to foster cooperation across disciplines such as biology and computer science, and to educate a new generation of students that will be bilingual in the languages of both the biological and computational sciences.

The instrument will be used for research on microbial growth kinetics for microbial physiology, genetics, ecology and biotechnology. While research has been focusing on understanding these growth kinetics from a genomic level, there is still great difficulty in making the leap from genetic analysis to accurate verification with batch culture growth experiments. Batch cultures are not ideal for characterizing cellular processes, because cells are constantly subjected to environmental changes that are difficult to analyze. In continuous culture, log-phase culture is maintained in steady state by controlling the environmental conditions and providing a steady inflow of nutrients and an outflow of culture broth from the growth vessel. A chemostat, for continuous culture experiments, can maintain consistent growth conditions for weeks, eliminating secondary growth effects that can overshadow small changes and allowing for reliable and reproducible data necessary in growth kinetics experiments. Under such long time scales, factors such as the cost of medium, maintaining sterility during medium addition, and number of experiments necessary become increasingly important. The objective of this project is to develop a system specifically designed for performing microscale parallel continuous cultures that is simple and inexpensive enough to be used in undergraduate laboratories, while providing the precision, data quality, and control capability sufficient for investigation in research laboratories.<br/><br/>This is a project to develop plastic microchips with controlled microenvironments smaller than a drop of water, for cell growth studies. These microscale life-support systems provide oxygen to the cells, neutralize their waste, and ensure that the cells are well-fed. The goal is to develop microchips that are inexpensive enough for undergraduate labs, as well as research. The microchips will be tested in undergraduate labs by developing modules for undergraduate research projects for an undergraduate course.

To answer this question, graduate student Laura Heineman, supervised by Dr. Marcia C. Inhorn, will investigate the interaction of transplantation with the daily lives of adult transplant recipients and their caregivers. This study focuses on three untested assumptions that: 1) transplantation, as a practice, is both founded upon and affecting cultural norms in the U.S.; 2) kin relations, cultivated in the home through activities of giving care, are a major component of transplantation's impact on daily life; 3) the arenas of constraint created by social stratification figure significantly in interactions between transplantation and human relatedness. These assumptions will be explored at a major transplant center in the U.S. Midwest that employs a care model which focuses on the use of family and friends to meet patients' care needs both during and after hospitalization. <br/><br/>The researcher will employ a variety of ethnographic and social science research methods, including semistructured, unstructured, genealogical, and life history interviews; participant observation; fieldnote and visual documentation; and review of health policy documents. She builds upon recent kinship theory, which examines multiple forms of relatedness beyond bio-genetic relations. Comparisons will include: 1) patients and caregivers who are related by blood, marriage, or adoption, versus those who are kin-like, but not related in these ways (to understand what constitutes relatedness) and 2) the experiences of transplantation in the hospital, versus those of transplant caregiving in the home (to ascertain the role of the home in kinship and transplant care). These data will be evaluated in light of constraints faced throughout the transplant process.<br/><br/>The research is important because it will be useful for improving health policy, outcomes for transplant patients (and others with serious, long-term illness), support for caregivers, and communication between medical professionals and patient populations. At a time when alternative forms of relatedness are highly contested (e.g., same-sex marriage and family-making via new reproductive technologies), studies such as this are crucial to understand the mechanisms by which kin relations are created, solidified, questioned, or changed. The research also will contribute significantly to the education of a social scientist.

IMOC works by imaging through an optical filter uniquely designed for spectral analysis for a specific application such as phytoplankton discrimination. It requires that the investigators develop a database of phytoplankton fluorescence excitation spectra under varying growth conditions and employ canonical discriminant analysis to identify one or more discriminant functions to identify phytoplankton taxa. <br/><br/>The PIs will use IMOC to combine instant spectroscopic analysis with a streak-camera-type microscopic imaging system to provide real-time or near-real-time classification. The method is ideal for field deployable instrumentation, making it an ideal addition to ocean observing platforms.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/><br/>Identification of marine phytoplankton is a critical area in biological oceanography. Successful implementation of this research could go far towards lowering the ambiguities in the identification of marine phytoplankton, which could easily be automated for use from buoys and other remote platforms. An educational outreach program will be pursued through an existing program (Rising Tide) that links high school teachers and undergraduate interns in summer research projects. Interns from South Carolina HBCU institutions would be targeted for this experience. Commercial development/private sector partnerships with academia would likely result from a successful project.

It consists of 1000 tons of heavy water contained in a 12-meter diameter acrylic vessel. In order to reduce cosmic-ray-induced backgrounds, the detector is located 6800 feet underground, in a working nickel mine near Sudbury, Ontario, Canada. SNO has recently stopped data acquisition (November 2006), having successfully solved the solar neutrino problem. <br/><br/>After the heavy water has been removed, the acrylic vessel will be filled with liquid scintillator for the SNO+ experiment. Transforming SNO into a liquid scintillator detector will boost the light yield by more than a factor of 50 and protons will replace deuterons as the principal neutrino target. SNO+ will preserve the excellent supernova neutrino sensitivity via charged-current and neutral-current reactions on both protons and carbon. Additionally, a liquid scintillator could serve as the medium in which a competitive, next-generation neutrinoless double beta decay search (SNO++) could be carried out. <br/><br/>This proposal seeks funds for a group at ISU to conduct developmental studies to optimize calibration methods and low-level background monitoring for SNO+, to investigate methods of monitoring calibration source positions, and to explore the possibility of using 150Nd in the liquid scintillator to search for neutrinoless double beta decay (SNO++). Funds are also sought to provide for ISU's continued efforts as part of the SNO+ collaboration, specifically with the calibration group.<br/><br/>Broader Impact<br/>This proposal will provide opportunities for Idaho State University undergraduate and graduate students to participate in a world-class international collaboration in a truly unique setting. Methods developed such as improved background monitoring techniques may be useful for SNOLAB and future underground laboratories. Techniques explored during the 150Nd studies may also prove useful for future experiments, given the difficulty in acquiring such enriched isotopes.

In particular, level repulsion between the eigenvalues of these operators will be studied. Absence of level repulsion for insulating disordered materials will be shown for larger classes of models than previously possible. Also, a model will be investigated which shows the transition from absence to presence of level repulsion. For the random displacement model, a Schrodinger operator modelling lattice fluctuations in crystals, the low energy states will be determined. <br/>Work will be done to better understand the stability of the localization phenomenon in the presence of exterior deterministic forces, leading to non- stationary random media.<br/><br/>Random Schrodinger operators are used as mathematical models to study electron transport of disordered media such as crystals with impurities, alloys, and amorphous materials. The effects arising from the presence of disorder in the structure of a material are central to distinguish between conductors and insulators. The phenomena which are observed, such as localization and extended states, provide mathematical foundations for electronics, but also apply to acoustic, electro-magnetic and elastic waves in disordered media. This project will further develop tools from a broad array of mathematical disciplines which are required for a rigorous understanding of these phenomena. Particular attention will be given to level statistics of electronic energies which allow to characterize insulators and conductors through properties of small material samples. The work will include multiple collaborative efforts and contribute to the training of three PhD students. Results will be widely disseminated through publications and at national and international conferences.

Al-Hashimi both of the University of Michigan whose research will advance the area of protein design by engineering some of the novel properties of fluorocarbons into biological molecules. This will be achieved by synthesizing proteins that contain extensively fluorinated ('fluorous') analogs of hydrophobic amino acids in their hydrophobic cores. Fluorous amino acids are predicted to stabilize proteins against unfolding by heat and organic solvents and to facilitate protein: protein recognition through specific fluorocarbon-fluorocarbon interactions. Fluorinated versions of a dimeric RNA-binding protein, Rop, will be synthesized in which the hydrophobic core of Rop will be repacked with the fluorous analog of leucine, hexafluoroleucine. This protein is small enough (63 residues) to be efficiently synthesized by peptide synthesis, which will allow fluorous amino acids to be introduced site specifically. Rop protein has been extensively used as a model system for investigating protein stability and folding, and as a template for protein re-design. These data will serve as a useful reference for the present study. A variety of physical techniques (such as circular dichroism, microcalorimetry and analytical ultracentrifugation) will be used to investigate the effect of fluorination on the biological activity, structure and stability of fluorous Rop proteins. An important innovation will be the use of residual dipolar coupling (RDC) NMR measurements to perform detailed comparisons of the effect of fluorination on the structure and conformational rigidity of the protein. The experiments will address fundamental questions about the impact of fluorination on protein structure and dynamics.<br/>This award from the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports Professors Neil Marsh and Hashim M. Al-Hashimi both of the University of Michigan whose research will impact attempts to design biosensors and enzymes used in industrial processes, where stability towards extremes of temperature and pH and towards organic solvents is necessary. There is the potential for fluorous proteins to find uses in medical imaging by exploiting the high NMR sensitivity of Fluorine 19 or their enhanced biological stability could lead to uses as therapeutic agents or vehicles for drug delivery. The project will advance the education, training and professional development of undergraduates, graduate students and postdoctoral scientists in the inter-disciplinary area of chemical biology and biophysics. To broaden their education further, a joint interdisciplinary group meeting and journal club will be initiated. Their professional development will be enhanced by active participation in the dissemination of their results, both through drafting manuscripts and progress reports, and through oral and poster presentations at local and national scientific meetings.

Compton of the University of Tennessee-Knoxville. This research will involve the study of chiral molecules (molecules with a non-superimposable mirror image) using novel laser based optical spectroscopy. The study will involve high-power lasers which allow for multiple-photon absorption by chiral molecules, called non-linear multiphoton spectroscopy, as opposed to the one-photon (linear spectroscopy) used for many, many years. The study of these multiphoton chiro-optical processes will allow greater understanding of chiral molecules. Further, attempts will be made to do asymmetric synthesis, that is, the preparation of a single optical isomer, using multiphoton excitation with circularly polarized light. Circularly polarized light (of which there is left and right circularly polarized light) interacts differently with the two non-superimposable mirror image molecules. Thus it may be possible to have the circularly polarized light produce a product which is one of the two mirror images. The experimental work will be supported by theoretical calculations.<br/><br/>In terms of the broader impacts, this research will impact the synthesis of chiral organic molecules. Many organic molecules such as drugs and the molecules of living creatures are chiral and there is tremendous interest in synthesizing chiral molecules, which is not an easy thing to do well. This research will also touch on the subject of the origins of life by addressing the question why are all amino acids or sugars in life molecules of one handedness? This research is also an excellent vehicle for training both chemistry and physics students, since this research spans both disciplines, and to broaden the knowledge and training of both.

Main St, Suite 710	Durham	NC	277054010	9196843030	BIO	1108	1108, 9184, BIOT	$0.00	This award is for the development of short-lived radioisotope tracing instrumentation in order to track in real time the assimilation, translocation, and export of materials within and between living plants under controlled environmental conditions. The Radioisotope Tracing with Environmental Controls (RTEC) system is based on the use of short-lived radioisotopes and gamma-ray coincidence counting techniques. Coincidence counting is an efficient and economical method of tracing the accumulation of radioactively tagged compounds in applications where high spatial resolution is not required. The implementation of the system will utilize the plant growth facility and the nuclear laboratory at the university, which are less than 100 meters apart. This RTEC system will be used to improve the mechanistic understanding of plant physiological responses to environmental change. Nine research groups are currently involved in the collaboration. The proposed instrument will provide the capabilities for examining dynamic effects of environmental change on carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) allocation in plants. In particular, the RTEC system will enable researchers to make some of the first systematic measurements of carbon and nitrogen translocation in different plant species at the plant-soil interface and within single plants under precisely controlled environmental conditions, information that will dramatically improve understanding of the controls on plant carbon sequestration. The research enabled by the RTEC system will complement field research projects that study the effects of elevated CO2 levels on plant growth. This instrument will enable measurements that can potentially reveal the mechanisms responsible for the apparent lack of long-term carbon sequestration by mature trees that has been observed in large-scale Free Air Carbon Dioxide Enrichment experiments that are underway globally. In addition, this instrument will open opportunities for research on topics such as the dynamics of nutrient uptake and distribution (using Nitrogen-13 tagged nutrients), water absorption and transport (using both Fluorine-18 in solution and Oxygen-15 tagged water), the carbon-nitrogen balance in plant growth (using Nitrogen-13 tagged nutrients and Carbon-11 tagged CO2), and the role of microbial activities in the carbon-nitrogen cycle. <br/><br/>In addition to its scientific benefits, this project will involve graduate and undergraduate students in frontier interdisciplinary research in biology and physics. For example, undergraduate biology and physics students will help with the assembly and testing of the gamma-ray detectors and will assist with the design, assembly and installation of the detector support structure in the growth chamber. Undergraduate students will also work on the design, installation and testing of the gas circulation loop used in the CO2 studies and with the overall system testing. Existing collaborations with physics faculty members at two regional historically black universities will encourage their use of this research instrumentation.

The existence of this so-called ``negative energy'' is allowed by the laws of quantum field theory, which describe the behavior of matter and energy on microscopic scales. Negative energy would also have repulsive gravitational effects. Situations involving negative energy, such as the Casimir effect and squeezed states of light, have been produced in the laboratory. However, the amounts of negative energy generated in these experiments are extremely tiny and hence not directly measurable. However, if the laws of physics impose no constraints on negative energy, then one might be able to create large amounts of it and thereby produce bizarre macroscopic effects. Such effects could include: traversable wormholes (tunnels connecting otherwise distant regions of space and time), warp drives (for faster-than-light travel), time machines for travel into the past, violations of the second law of thermodynamics (e.g., refrigerators requiring no power sources), and the destruction of black holes (the remains of collapsed dead stars). However, research by L. Ford (Tufts U.) and the PI over more than a decade has shown that quantum field theory does impose some rather strong restrictions on negative energy. These constraints have come to be known as ``quantum inequalities,'' and yield severe limitations on the possible macroscopic effects mentioned above because they imply that large negative energies can exist for only short periods of time. The theoretical results obtained to date indicate that negative energy must be subtly intertwined with positive energy in space. An unanswered question is to what extent this must be true in general. Part of the research will be focused on narrowing the gap between distributions of negative energy which can be ruled out and those which are definitely allowed. The primary emphasis will be on a study of quantum states which involve negative energy and which can be produced using the techniques of quantum optics. A related, but smaller, part of the research will aim to study the connections between negative energy, energy conservation, and the evaporation and possible destruction of black holes.<br/>This work lies at the intersection of, and deeply impacts, three important areas of physics: quantum field theory, Einstein's theory of gravity (general relativity), and thermodynamics. A primary goal of this research is to establish closer ties between this work on negative energy and the rapidly growing field of quantum optics. Such a link between these two areas of physics might allow experimental tests of at least the indirect effects of negative energy. The last ten years have seen the growth of a small but very active international group of researchers on the subject of negative energy. It is planned to involve undergraduates in this project.
0654195	Singular Integral Operators in Several Complex Variables	DMS	ANALYSIS PROGRAM	08/01/2007	08/01/2007	Jennifer Halfpap	MT	University of Montana	Standard Grant	Bruce P. Palka	07/31/2010	$74,200.00		halfpap@mso.umt.edu	32 CAMPUS DRIVE MAIN HALL	Missoula	MT	598120001	4062436670	MPS	1281	0000, 9150, OTHR	$0.00	The most important partial differential operators in the theory of functions of several complex variables are the Cauchy-Riemann (CR) operator and the tangential CR- operator, obtained by restricting the CR-operator to a surface in complex n-dimensional space. This project aims to extend in a significant way known results concerning the tangential CR-operator and the associated system of partial differential equations. In general, this system does not have a unique solution, so the best that one can do is to find the unique square-integrable solution orthogonal to the null-space of the operator. For this reason a fundamental object of study is the Szego projection operator, which is the orthogonal projection of the space of square-integrable functions onto the null space of the tangential CR-operator. This operator is well understood in the case of hypersurfaces in two-dimensional complex space that are of finite type (which means that they are not too flat). Part of this project examines the Szego projection operator for infinite-type surfaces in two-space. The approach is to think of the operator in terms of integration against a kernel and then to estimate the kernel function. The methods used in the finite-type case do not extend to this setting, so new ideas are needed. The principal investigator also intends to study the kernel for the Szego projection operator for convex surfaces in higher dimensions. The operator is reasonably well understood in this situation, though previous approaches have used knowledge of the Bergman kernel rather than direct analysis of the integral kernel. An examination of the latter should give additional insight into the nonisotropic metric that arises in this case. Finally, the CR- operator itself will be studied for a model non-(pseudo)convex surface in complex two-space for which estimates on the Szego kernel exist, but for which little is known about the CR-operator itself.<br/><br/>Partial differential equations provide a powerful language for describing relationships between changing quantities. Some model heat flow, others are concerned with wave propagation, and yet others are just objects of study in their own right. For any partial differential one is interested in solving for unknown functions in terms of given initial data. The objective is to determine conditions under which a solution exists, conditions under which a solution is unique, and relationships between the properties of the given data and properties of the solution. Although this project studies partial differential equations that are of fundamental interest in pure rather than applied mathematics, the new techniques developed will be much more broadly applicable.

The proposed work will expand prior investigations of chemical dynamics to hydrogen bonding and nonpolar solvent environments to include new proton transfer and intermolecular electron transfer systems. Implementation of a technique known as Resonant Pump Third-Order Raman Probe Spectroscopy (RaPTORS) will allow direct probing of the solvent dynamics in a series of solvation and charge transfer studies. The solvent response to hydrogen bonding will be explored with the use of alkanols, formamides, and water as the solvent with coumarin dyes as solutes. Other proposed solvents to study include chloroform, benzene, and cylcohexanes with a variety of solutes. Proposed collaboration with computational chemists in the research group of Prof. Todd Martinez at University of Illinois will add valuable theoretical insight to this work.<br/><br/>A significant proportion of chemistry, from industrial reactions the chemistry of biology, takes place in the solution phase. This project will contribute to the development of models for chemistry in solution that are more accurate and tractable. Professor Blank and the researchers involved in the program will benefit from valuable collaborations with Bethel College and the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign, to further strengthen and enrich the research experience.

The intermediate energy group at California State University, Los Angeles (CSLA) proposes a study of these questions using the electromagnetic probe. In heavy nuclei for shells near the Fermi energy theoretical calculations indicate the need for the presence of long-range correlations. However, in light mass nuclei short range nucleon-nucleon correlations are more important. The experimental work will be carried out at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (TJNAF) and will consist of experiments scheduled or approved in conjunction with the Hall A and Hall C collaboration.<br/><br/><br/>The CSLA group will focus most of its efforts on leading a scheduled experiment (E06-007) on the measurement of long-range correlations and the effect of relativity on the structure of nuclear states in the lead region. It will also commit to the successful completion of the experiment by supervising the experimental data analysis by the PhD and MS student(s) assigned to this experiment. Its experience with the lead target in this high current run will assist it in its continuing target development for another high intensity lead experiment, namely the determination of a nuclear neutron radius The CSLA group will lead an approved experiment to determine the response function in proton knockout reactions from helium at high momentum and energy transfer. This experiment would provide benchmark data against which current and new models of nuclear structure including relativistic structure can be compared. Information from this measurement will also address the question of possible nuclear medium effects on the nucleon's structure. This measurement carried out to extremely large missing momentum may also reveal the onset of quark degrees of freedom in nuclear structure<br/><br/><br/>The CSLA group will participate in experiments to determine the electromagnetic structure of the proton to a large momentum transfer and explicitly measure two-photon contributions to the e-p interaction. The group stationed an undergraduate student during previous summers at Jefferson Lab in the previous grant period to assist in the assembly of the calorimeter. Graduate students from CSLA will assist in the installation, execution and analysis of the experiment.<br/><br/><br/>As members of Jefferson Lab collaborations the group will also be involved in other select nucleon and nuclear experiments in which it has a strong interest. The group has played a leading role in the design, construction, commissioning and evaluation of high luminosity cryogenic targets.<br/><br/><br/>The CSLA group will continue to place special emphasis on involving students in its experimental research program, including graduate, undergraduates and selected high school students and teachers in a meaningful way. This effort is coordinated with outreach programs they are leading involving local area high schools that have large populations of minority students. Students and teachers have been fruitfully engaged in appropriate data analysis, writing of a MS thesis and Monte Carlo simulations in the past, and CSLA students have appeared as co-authors on published research. They will continue to be significantly involved in the new experiments being proposed here, including submission of MS. theses.

The challenge for teachers is to develop strategies for using standards-based curriculum materials in ways that construct coherence across various policy and accountability messages and support students' learning. The goal of Phase 1 of this research is to develop a data-driven conceptual framework for understanding the resources, understandings, and contexts that frame teachers' uses of curriculum materials. This research will contribute to the field's understanding of teachers' use of standards-based curriculum materials by situating teachers' curriculum use strategies in multiple curricular, policy, and developmental contexts and by linking these strategies to student achievement. In Phase 2, the goal is to design a pre-service teacher learning tool based on this conceptual framework and document the effects of this tool on pre-service teachers' beliefs and practices with respect to curriculum materials. <br/><br/>The central research activities include multiple classroom observations and interviews with 3rd and 4th-grade teachers over two years, focused on the ways in which teachers notice, read, evaluate, adapt, and integrate curriculum materials and other instructional resources in interactions with students. The central educational activities include involving students from a graduate curriculum course in the design of the pre-service teacher learning tool and then implementing this tool with two cohorts of undergraduate elementary mathematics methods students at Iowa State University. Educational materials developed during this project will be accessible and relevant to pre-service teachers and teacher educators in a variety of settings; the digital nature of the materials will allow for broad dissemination.

The programs are co-hosted by Robert Krulwich, science reporter for NPR, and Jared Abumrad, WNYC radio producer and music composer. The programs are using a new, unorthodox format with music, live sounds and conversations between the hosts designed to appeal to young adult listeners who previously thought they did not like science. Each episode is crafted around a scientific finding and aims to connect the scientific inquiry to philosophical and universal implications. Program topics will include biology and neuroscience as well as physics, genetics, chemistry, math and engineering. The program carriage goal is to have the hour-long programs airing on 100 stations reaching three to four million listeners by the end of the project. The shorter segments will be distributed by NPR in its regular news magazine programs. Programs will also be podcast on NPR and WNYC's web sites, as well as through iTunes. The project will also train NPR science reporters on this new approach to science news content.

The system underlying this complex human ability is completely unconscious. We cannot directly look inside our minds or brains to see how this works, but we deduce what this system looks like by seeing what different expressions are well formed and what they mean. <br/><br/>Much previous work that attempts to model such systems posits a rather complicated architecture and one that is difficult to translate into a system that humans actually use in real time. The aim of the research here is to investigate a much simpler picture of the way the system works. The current hypothesis, called direct compositionality, posits that meanings are derived directly as smaller linguistic expressions (words and phrases) combine together to give larger ones. If this hypothesis is correct, it will help provide an explanation for how it is that people process speech in actual conversational settings immediately and effortlessly, as it is happening. Understanding the processes by which people decode messages also will ultimately help in designing a variety of systems that attempt to simulate human intelligence, including intelligent systems for human/machine interactions, as well as systems of machine translation.

In particular, in these classrooms, we expect students to learn new mathematics by attending to and critiquing the mathematical arguments of others. For these goals to be achieved, students need to be able to understand others' mathematical arguments and to determine whether or not a mathematical argument is valid. Research has shown that students and mathematics teachers frequently lack this ability. We know little about what cognitive processes a person should use to determine whether a mathematical argument is valid or to construct understanding from reading a mathematical argument. The purpose of this proposal is to address both of these issues with the following series of studies:<br/><br/>(a) An expert-novice study in which undergraduate mathematics majors and mathematicians are observed as they read and evaluate a collection of mathematical arguments, the results of which will inform<br/>(b) The development of pedagogical techniques and curricula materials using a design research paradigm to teach students the knowledge and strategies they need to comprehend mathematical arguments, and<br/>(c) A controlled experiment in which the pedagogical techniques developed in (b) will be implemented with a group of students and these students' performance on a post-test will be compared to a control group's performance.<br/><br/>Intellectual merit.<br/>The proposed work will provide insight into the mathematical practices of reading and evaluating mathematical arguments and will delineate why students find these activities problematic. The proposed work will yield documented effective teaching methods to teach undergraduates the knowledge and skills to read and evaluate mathematical arguments effectively. <br/><br/>Broader impact.<br/>These results will be of interest to mathematics professors who regularly teach proof-oriented classes and teachers of other scientific disciplines, such as physics, where argumentation plays a pivotal role. These results will also be useful for educators who prepare future teachers of mathematics. The results of these studies will be presented at academic conferences for both mathematicians and mathematics educations, and these results will be published in peer-reviewed journals.<br/><br/>Educational goals.<br/>I will give workshops for mathematics professors who are looking for new ways to teach proof-oriented mathematics courses and for

This method is explicit, elementary, and done in coordinates. In his subsequent research,<br/>he will apply his methods, using additional ideas when appropriate, to prove theorems involving <br/>oscillatory integrals, Radon transforms, and other subjects in which he has done research. In addition <br/>to these areas, he will branch out into several other of the diverse areas that relate to <br/>resolution of singularities. For example, he intends to work on multilinear generalizations of <br/>oscillatory integral operators, problems related to the stability of integrals, and associated <br/>problems in algebraic geometry such as those involving multiplier sheaves. In addition, intriguing <br/>algorithmic and computational questions arose during the development of [G1], and he plans to <br/>investigate such issues in computational algebraic geometry.<br/><br/>Oscillatory integral operators are a part of Fourier analysis, a field with wide application in<br/>science and engineering, such as in signal processing, cryptography, and statistics. As a result,<br/>improved understanding of oscillatory integral operators resulting from this research has the <br/>potential to help in the development of scientific applications that use Fourier analytic methods. In <br/>addition, Radon transforms are fundamental to MRI and other medical imaging applications, and also find <br/>uses in diverse fields ranging from oil exploration to homeland security. As a result, improved <br/>theoretical knowledge of Radon transforms resulting from this research may lead to advances in such <br/>fields.

The focus will be on mining in situ hybridization (ISH) images of multi-cell systems and on capturing the cell-level histological context of gene expression in Drosophila embryos. The challenge is to design a good feature extraction function, distance measure, text/image data fusion methods, and spatio-temporal models, which to our knowledge remain very underdeveloped, for embryonic ISH images in Drosophila. The main novelties are: (a) more salient feature extraction based on state-of-the-art image processing techniques such as mathematical morphology, a variety of filters, wavelets, graph-theoretic and probabilistic segmentations, etc.; (b) novel graph-based methods and probabilistic models for image/text fusion and cross-modal querying; (c) novel latent- space models capturing higher-level semantic similarity rather than direct feature similarity of functionally or behaviorally similar genes in variable morphology contexts, (d) Kalman filters and non-linear dynamic models, to model and predict spatio-temporal evolutions of gene expression. Moreover a repository of ISH images will be created with the expressions of all known genes in the Drosophila genome from public sources. The structured database can be searched 'by image example' or by keyword (all automatically derived). Systematic profiling of in situ hybridization images of gene expression patterns will attract high interest. Powerful and sophisticated computer algorithms will be needed to analyze these data. The proposed system will meet these needs and will provide a better understanding of embryo development as well as which genes/proteins affect what. This project is a necessary step towards the ultimate, long term goal, of understanding the molecular mechanism of embryo development, and the unraveling of the gene regulation network involved in this process. It also offers a new image-based platform for genetics and developmental biology education.

The net reaction for many mineral surface processes are known, but the pathway(s) and mechanism(s) through which they occur are not well constrained. Calcite is a particularly important mineral in that it is: a dominant buffer of acidity in soils and groundwater, one of several materials used to understand crystal growth generally, and studied widely to understand biomineralization processes. In the abiological dissolution and growth of calcite, specific, molecular-scale, limiting reaction mechanisms have been proposed, but have not been tested.<br/><br/>Similarly, during biomineralization it is known that certain molecules and proteins such as aspartates can influence growth morphology, but quantitative estimates of their kinetic effects remain elusive. The main goal of this proposal is to test proposed reaction mechanisms for calcite dissolution and growth by directly comparing formation and activation energies for step movement measured experimentally to reactions simulated from first principles. Classical crystal growth theories will form the framework to relate the experimentally measured quantities to the simulated chemical mechanisms. The reactions that will be tested are the mechanisms of kink site formation thought to control the movement of steps at circum-neutral pH, atmospheric pCO2, and saturations near equilibrium as well as growth inhibition by a model compound.<br/><br/>The proposed research will take place over three years and will address three main hypotheses that will form the bulk of a Ph.D. dissertation:<br/><br/>*Hypothesis 1: Step movement on calcite surfaces observed by AFM can be fit by the same model for both growth and dissolution, where kink site formation and propagation are limiting.<br/>*Hypothesis 2: Accurate kink site formation and activation energies can be simulated from first principles calculations and simulations.<br/>*Hypothesis 3: Detachment of the carboxylic acid functional group of aspartate from calcium ions on the step edge controls its ability to poison growth.<br/><br/>The activation and formation energies for kink sites will be estimated from atomic force microscopy measurements of step velocity as a function of saturation and temperature. These will be compared to direct observations of kink site concentrations in equilibrium solutions using high resolution AFM. Simulations will conducted after ensuring the best fit to existing crystal truncation rod date of water structure at calcite interfaces. The mechanism of the reactions will be then be tested by simulating kink site formation and activation energies using ab initio density functional theory and molecular dynamics umbrella sampling. The possible importance of the dissociation of water in the reaction will be explored by protonating surface carbonate and hydroxylating surface calcium ions. Finally, the same AFM measurements and simulation techniques will be made in the presence of aspartate and the experimentally estimated activation energy for growth poisoning will be compared to the simulated activation energy for detachment of aspartate from a calcium on a step edge. The proposed research will combine experimental and computational techniques in a novel way to explicitly test our understanding of growth and dissolution reactions on calcite. This information could be used subsequently in larger-scale rate measurements where assignation of physical meaning to measured rate constants is ambiguous.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: This project will form the bulk of a graduate student's Ph.D. dissertation. Additionally, in year two, a K-12 teacher will be awarded a Georgia Intern-Fellowship for Teachers (GIFT) and work in the laboratory of the PI for six weeks. The goal is to provide experience for the teacher so that he or she can better incorporate modern environmental science into their K-12 Earth Science class. The results from this work could result in some long-term benefits to science as well. These include an enhancement of our ability to predict the kinetics of mineral surface reactions in environmental settings, the design of new growth inhibitors to tailor crystallization techniques to industrial applications, creation of nano-devices and improved heterogeneous catalysis techniques. These are areas where the current lack of understanding makes it difficult to predict a priori what the effect added components will have on a system. This in turn makes design of new growth inhibitors or modifiers for a given system or application difficult, and the quantitative prediction of the rates of mineral surface reactions is often beyond reach.<br/><br/>This project is supported jointly with the Ceramics Program in the Division of Materials Research.

The first part of the research will consider a version of modular inflation<br/>called racetrack inflation developed by the PI and his collaborators. Modular inflation<br/>uses the potentials generated for the moduli fields that occur in string theory<br/>compactifications as the source of the negative pressure required for the inflationary<br/>period. In this picture the mechanism for reheating will be studied and the generation<br/>of fluctuations in the Cosmic Microwave background due to iso-curvature perturbations.<br/>The PI will also investigate other typed of inflation that can occur in string theory<br/>compactifications. The second aspect of the proposal will be a detailed study of<br/>D-Brane inflation. In this picture the scalar field responsible for inflation parameterizes<br/>the position of a brane along the internal manifold. One possible consequence of this<br/>picture is that during inflation there is brane-antibrane annihilation which could lead to<br/>the production of cosmic strings which have observable cosmological effects.<br/>The broader implications of this proposal are that If string theory can be directly verified<br/>(or falsified) by measurement of cosmological parameters this would be very important.<br/>The PI intends to create a web page for the general public explaining the main results of<br/>his work. He also intends to get involved with Physics Theory-Net and give lectures at<br/>local high schools.
